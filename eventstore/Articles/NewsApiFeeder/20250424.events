I generally read articles/papers or watch videos, and then create papers/articles/code and have discussions as a result. While creating blog posts could be considered ‘giving back’, I think most of the benefit is personal because it (if well-written) forces me to make sense of and distill the ideas therein sufficiently such that someone else can understand me, which requires confronting various weaknesses and problems with the idea and improving on them (This is also one reason why I believe feedback systems are important).\n\nOther sources refer to this as the Knowledge Lifecycle, of which I’ve included a screenshot below (the image comes from A Complete Guide to Tagging for Personal Knowledge Management ( link) — they do a great job explaining this idea in detail which I won’t repeat).\n\nMy Markdown-based Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) notes system, which I’ve been building for years and currently interact with using Obsidian, is a grounds for this. In a nutshell, this is my process:\n\nOrganize how I ingest new knowledge. I usually learn from articles/blogs/papers/videos online and sometimes learn from books as well, but all of these, even finding out about said book, originate from a browser tab. I maintain different sets of browser tabs for different research areas in both work and personal pursuits and organize these using tools such as the awesome BrainTool and sometimes Obsidian. After writing this post, I created a read-it-later solution for this. ^85m76m Any high-quality paper/article/video/etc. I read and want to remember goes into Zotero and synced between laptops/desktops via Syncthing (and is annotated there for PDFs only) (#todo write a post on link rot and my interest in preserving digital information) Said annotations and links to the local Zotero file+URL are synced into Obsidian as a paired ‘Source’ note for whenever I want to write additional things regarding that source of information (via plugin Obsidian-Zotero Integration) Non-Source notes in my PKM system are all my own writings and ideas which I often build off of Sources and their corresponding Source Notes using Markdown links and embeds (though sometimes I lazily skip this and just cite URLs) A few of these notes become well-developed and useful (meaning useful even after they are written—I still think the act of writing itself forces the writer to clarify certain concepts and is useful even if the writing itself isn’t used again) A few useful notes seem interesting enough that I think others may benefit from them, so I spend time improving the prose, generalizing them, etc., and create a blog post.\n\nOut of 100 saved papers/articles, ~20 will have source notes, ~10 of those source notes lead to my own independent idea notes, ~4 of them become well-developed and useful, and just 1 gets turned into a blog post.\n\nThe problem with my previous site setup was that while all of my knowledge (from other sources or from me) was stored in my tightly-integrated Zotero+Obsidian setup (steps 1-4 above), step 5’s blog posts containing in principal my highest-quality technical assimilations of knowledge were disjointly stored in the site’s repository. I’d like to have everything in one place so it is all easily searchable and linkable and therefore give me greater opportunities to make new connections between my ideas and other sources’ ideas. Sure, I can just have multiple copies of the posts, but heaven forbid I have to correct that missed typo in two places. (Though in all seriousness, I wanted to eliminate any friction that would discourage me from publishing new content or improving existing posts.)\n\nThus, I wanted to find a way to better integrate all of my knowledge in one place and also seamlessly publish blog entries to increase the chances of me actually doing so. I may stop using the term ‘blog’ in the future as I expect to update and improve these posts the same way I improve my own private notes (or ‘posts’).\n\n# How I Automate it\n\nI often spend far too many hours building or automating things that have perfectly reasonable alternatives, because I find it fun to understand and control every step of the process (and on some rare occasions it becomes objectively useful as well). I’ve done this with my blog in my 2023 redesign—while I could have easily made an account on https://substack.com/, I prefer to have total control over the look and feel of the site (e.g., no annoying popups to subscribe after reading 1/4 down the article) and already had a simpler custom blog since 2019.\n\nWhen I first acquired the domain ryanwwest.com, I had a Wordpress site for about a month and got very sick of it. I quickly decided instead to make a static site instead by just placing HTML/CSS/JavaScript files on my hosting server, but since I am much more proficient at backend/network software engineering than frontend, I didn’t want to open the door of endless JavaScript frameworks and instead opted to use the Markdown->static site generator Hugo.\n\nHugo works great because I already heavily use Markdown via Obsidian for my PKM system. However, Hugo on its own turned out to be insufficient for my needs, as I only have time to write a blog post very irregularly, and had to remember how to rerun the site generator, log into site server, and publish the new article every time which disincentivized publishing. Any changes to a blog post required repeating the process and the articles were disjoint from the rest of my knowledge base, and I don’t want any friction.\n\nHugo can be customized with themes, and I chose the Quartz Theme which adds goodies like [[Wikilink]] support, search, backlinks, local graph view, dark/light mode toggle, etc. However, while this brings Markdown-style parity between blog post notes and all other notes to be nearly the same, it still doesn’t automate the publishing of posts (and I don’t want to pay $20 a month for something like Obsidian Publish).\n\nThus, I’ve automated it as follows:\n\nOn any device using Obsidian, Vim, or another file editor, I create a blog post in its own Markdown file witin the blog/ subdirectory of my PKM vault. I have a Linux server and sync my PKM vault folder between it and my other computers/devices using Syncthing. My Linux server runs a cron job every minute which runs a script that scans the blog/ subdirectory to get lists of all Markdown files and png/jpg files they link to (which are stored not in blog/ , but media/ with all other non-blog attachments), uses rsync to copy them over to my Hugo directory, and generates the Hugo site based on just those copied files (it excludes Markdown files that are drafts, but I have a ‘staging’ version of my site including drafts available on that server that I can access via my Tailscale personal-only VPN). The same cron job also commits just the public HTML output folder of Hugo to a Git repo (if there are changes) and pushes to GitHub. On my site provider’s Linux server, I run another cron job which periodically tries to pull the same Git repo for changes. Because the repo is just the public HTML, ryanwwest.com just points that repo for the entire site’s HTML/CSS/JavaScript. If I edit a blog post note from Obsidian on any device, it should be live within a few minutes.\n\nI wanted a comment system for my posts as well to allow for generative conversation between myself and interested readers, but didn’t want to host it myself (because more expensive to run, have to deal with spam and a login system, etc.). That disqualified seemingly great self-hosted options like Isso and Discourse, and I didn’t want something proprietary like Disqus which injects its own ads. Hypothesis seems extremely neat for a blog comment system (and technically already exists for every site, but you can fully integrate it without needing a browser extension), but issues include lack of comment moderation (individuals cannot easily make Publisher Groups which allow this), a confusing/unfamiliar interface for post-wide comments (comments that are not specific to a certain line of text in the post), and no comment upvoting system. But I’m keeping an eye on this one. Graham Macphee use Mastodon for blog comments which is neat, but too early for me.\n\nWhat I instead chose was giscus. It uses a GitHub repo’s Discussions feature to give users an almost Reddit-like commenting experience where one Discussion is automatically created for every post. A snippet of JavaScript at the end of this page embeds the comments on the associated GitHub discussion and lets anyone read comments directly on this page, and lets readers with GitHub accounts also comment directly on on this page (or on GitHub). Discussion comments support Markdown and images, reactions, threaded replies, upvoting, and can be sorted by most upvotes/oldest/newest. The biggest problem is that it is dependent on GitHub (including requiring commenters to have a GitHub account), though sorting by top comments also isn’t yet supported directly on the blog page. Since I presume most of my readers are technical, I’m not too concerned about these, but would switch to something else if a better alternative came along. Easily commenting/annotating specific parts of the post might also be nice, as Hypothes.is allows, but this can be partially satisfied with quotes.\n\nGreat source of ideas for other commenting systems: https://darekkay.com/blog/static-site-comments/\n\nGreat post advocating comments within blogs: https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-blog-without-comments-is-not-a-blog/\n\n# Future Improvements\n\nI’d like to have a way to hide certain ‘personal comment’ lines within a blog post’s Markdown file that may contain helpful information for the author but not for readers (like links to other non-blog notes). I specifically left in a #todo ‘comment’ above to illustrate how this was unnecessary for the reader to see, but helpful for me in that context.\n\nBeing able to instantly write and edit blog posts is both a blessing and a curse. A curse, because if I accidentally change a file on any device anywhere, that modification rapidly goes live. Not really a big deal for a small personal blog, but maybe it will come back to bite. (Accidental deletes, on the other hand, are not a problem because rsync doesn’t delete in this case - I must manually remove them, which is only annoying for filename changes)\n\nI’d also like for the table of contents to hover to the left of the main article column when the browser aspect ratio allows it, rather than being pinned to the top of the page.\n\nI have a YouTube channel with just one video (as of 2023-03-22). That may be another good medium for posting future technical content and may be easier and more accessible for content consumption."}

Loading . . .\n\nThe Napalm Girl Standard By: Som-Mai Nguyen Date: Apr. 24, 2025 Illustrations: Nguyen Tran How the war’s most horrific photograph is now a litmus test for free speech in the era of social media.\n\nIt’s a photo you may have already seen. Captured in stark black and white, several Vietnamese children run down a road, flanked by soldiers. In the left foreground, there is a crying child whose mouth is contorted. But the viewer’s eye drifts toward the center and the main subject of the photograph: a 9-year-old girl, who is naked, crying, and shrieking in agony from the burns on her body. The photograph is titled “The Terror of War,” but it is ubiquitously known as the Napalm Girl photograph.\n\nThe napalm attack that the children were fleeing was an instance of friendly fire, carried out by South Vietnamese forces allied with the United States, flying American-made planes and dropping American napalm in an attempt to flush out Northern forces from hiding. This image, for which Huỳnh Công “Nick” Út was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, was taken in Trảng Bàng, an hour’s drive northwest of today’s Ho Chi Minh City, in June 1972.\n\n“The Terror of War” is sometimes credited with ending the war through sheer emotional impact, swinging American public opinion toward military withdrawal and eventually bringing about the Paris Peace Accords in January 1973. The photograph was indeed powerful. (US President Richard Nixon can be heard wondering whether the photograph had been doctored in a White House audio recording. In another, he encouraged Henry Kissinger to “think big” and suggested the nuclear bomb.) But in truth, the tide of public opinion had already turned years prior. A year before the photograph was taken, 61 percent of American respondents to a June 1971 Gallup poll answered that it had been a mistake to send US troops to Vietnam; only 28 percent maintained that it had not. Six years earlier, in August 1965, only 24 percent had believed involvement to be a mistake, while 61 percent had not.\n\nIf the Napalm Girl photograph played a role in ending the war, it was as part of a larger technological media shift that had pervaded the entire Vietnam War. From the 1950s until its withdrawal from the war in 1973, the US supplied arms, troops, and death to Southeast Asia. Contemporaneous developments in media technology — that is, television broadcasting and photojournalism — made war newly visible to the American public. The response was overwhelming. Until as recently as 1945, political or religious commitment to pacifism could serve as a bar to naturalization, but the Vietnam War redefined antiwar activism as mainstream societal discontent, taken up by intellectuals, rockstars, and Hollywood celebrities alike.\n\nIt is no wonder that this era generated some of America’s most important case law around the freedom of speech. In the Pentagon Papers case, the Nixon Administration targeted the press that had brought home the horror of war; countless cases related to antiwar demonstrations redefined everything from students’ right to protest to the legality of displaying the word “fuck” in public.\n\nAs with Nixon, today’s executive has launched an onslaught on speech, including plans to expand ICE’s existing surveillance dragnet by punishing noncitizens merely for perceived dissent on social media. These attacks reflect how, in the present day, much of American political life in no small part takes place online, via internet platforms and social media networks with complex and often opaque content moderation apparatuses. There, the legacy of the Vietnam War can also be found.\n\n“The Terror of War” is, after all, a violent, nonconsensual nude image of a child. It is also of tremendous historical importance — and before it became history itself, it was hard-hitting, weighty speech of a political nature. It is a troubling photograph that lives at the boundary of free speech; a difficult edge case for social media platforms that has come up time and again as they set, adjust, and modify their content moderation standards. The Napalm Girl photograph has left an indelible mark on how speech is governed, despite never establishing court precedent at all.\n\nLoading . . . The Napalm Girl photograph has left an indelible mark on how speech is governed, despite never establishing court precedent at all\n\nThe girl in the photograph, Kim Phúc Phan Thị, defected to Canada some decades later. In 2022, she penned an op-ed in The New York Times, looking back on the 50 years since the picture was taken, during which she had been reduced to “a symbol of the horrors of war.”\n\nPhan grew up “detesting” the photograph, which had been shot and distributed without her consent. “I thought to myself, ‘I am a little girl. I am naked. Why did he take that picture? Why didn’t my parents protect me? Why did he print that photo? Why was I the only kid naked while my brothers and cousins in the photo had their clothes on?’”\n\nShe was grateful to the photographer for later taking her to receive medical care; she even credited him with saving her life. But still, Phan identified a sense of violation, trauma layered on top of trauma, an assault on her privacy and bodily autonomy that was inextricable from her memories of the war and the burn scars she carried on one-third of her body.\n\nThe historical importance and wide dissemination of “The Terror of War” is particularly bizarre, given that nude images of children are a category of speech that is infamous for its inflexible prohibition. These images are so categorically condemned that Congress passed a law in 1996 that banned “sexually explicit images that appear to depict minors” that were produced without using any real children — a prohibition so broad that it practically anticipates current-day debates on nonconsensual AI-generated pornography. (The Supreme Court partially struck down the law, finding the broadest provisions to violate the First Amendment; some years later, the similarly written 2003 Protect Act was ultimately upheld.)\n\nThe prohibitions on child pornography are so broad, so socially uncontested, that there is not much room for debate. But discussion of the lasting impact that a photograph can have on its subject can be found with respect to a newer, overlapping category of prohibited speech: nonconsensual intimate images, sometimes called revenge porn. The banned activity usually involves the distribution of explicit images of individuals without their consent and may include images originally obtained or produced without consent (e.g., hidden camera footage, deepfakes), as well as images that were originally obtained with consent (e.g., something shared with a romantic partner) but distributed without consent. In either case, such violations can cause reputational and psychological harm that is irreparable.\n\nNonconsensual intimate images are a relatively new category of banned speech, one that is prohibited through a federal cause of action in the 2022 Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act, a patchwork set of narrowly tailored state laws, and content moderation standards across the internet.\n\nNot very many people can say that they, too, were victims of a napalm attack, but the emotional damage that Phan attributes to “The Terror of War” will sound all too familiar to other victims of nonconsensual intimate images — her anxiety and shame, her unwilling place in the public eye. Her photograph was neither taken nor disseminated with malicious intent, but intent cannot erase impact. Her account of the psychological turmoil she experienced over the decades is deeply troubling, particularly when one considers how “The Terror of War” is treated as an exception and counterpoint to other nonconsensual nude images, whether of adults or minors.\n\nThe Napalm Girl photograph is a recurring motif in current speech policy, which is due to a rash in nonconsensual intimate images online and the activism to shut it down, whether through statutes or platform content moderation. In 2014, when the Arizona state legislature criminalized the display, publication, and sale of such images, the ACLU of Arizona argued — successfully — that the statute as written was overbroad, since it would have prohibited the dissemination of the Napalm Girl photograph, among other historically significant photos. When Rhode Island passed its own law, its ACLU affiliate once again raised the specter of “The Terror of War,” saying that, as written, “a newspaper would have to think twice before publishing an iconic photo like the Vietnam ‘napalm girl’ because the dissemination of such a photo could run afoul of the law depending on a jury’s view of its ‘newsworthiness.’”\n\nWhile courts and legislatures across the country grappled with balancing nonconsensual intimate images against the historical and political impact of the Napalm Girl, social media platforms like Facebook were developing their own content moderation policies in parallel. In 2016, Norwegian journalist Tom Egeland included the Napalm Girl photograph in a piece on famous images of war. It featured as the banner image for the article on Facebook, which removed the post and suspended Egeland, citing impermissible nudity. When his newspaper, Aftenposten, reported on the suspension, Facebook responded that “[a]ny photographs of people displaying fully nude genitalia or buttocks, or fully nude female breast, will be removed.” Aftenposten’s article reporting on the removal of the article — which also featured the Napalm Girl photograph — was then deleted from the paper’s Facebook page.\n\nFacebook retreated from its position after sustained outrage. “Sometimes, the global and historical importance of a photo like ‘Terror of War’ outweighs the importance of keeping nudity off Facebook,” Justin Osofsky, Meta’s head of partnerships and business development, posted in concession.\n\nAlthough Facebook characterized the deletion as a “mistake,” employees later told Reuters that the Napalm Girl photograph had been used specifically as a training example for content moderation staff, who were instructed that it violated Facebook policy despite historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress, photographed without her consent.\n\nMeta’s Transparency Center explains that it “introduced [its] newsworthiness allowance in October 2016 after receiving global criticism for removing the iconic ‘Napalm Girl’ photo, which, as a result of this allowance, is visible across [Meta] platforms today.”\n\nThe wording oddly conflates “newsworthiness” — which suggests the ongoing or prospective — with historical significance. Meta’s other publicly listed examples of newsworthy determinations all involve contemporary war or political debates. It’s unclear how many, if any, among the 169 total between June 2021 through June 2024 involve historical photojournalism, though we do know that in 2018, Facebook deleted and later reinstated a post on Holocaust awareness that used a photograph of stripped and emaciated children in a Nazi concentration camp. The restoration of the post came with apologies and acknowledgment of an “important image of historical significance.”\n\nSince November 18th, 2020, Meta’s child nudity policy has provided an exception for “[i]magery posted by a news agency that depicts child nudity in the context of famine, genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity, unless accompanied by a violating caption or shared in a violating context, in which case the content is removed.” The policy might as well bear Phan’s name.\n\nLoading . . . No photo could launch an antiwar movement; rather, the movement captioned the photo\n\nSo what has the photograph of Phan been retroactively tasked with, when it is held up as an image of “global and historical significance”? The treacly notion that this image ended the war because Americans had never before seen the true violence of war doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.\n\nThe death and destruction left behind on the battlefield of Gettysburg was documented in soft sepia tones. The horrors of Dachau were photographed and published en masse as a series of postcards at the immediate close of World War II, possibly as part of a larger campaign to publicize Nazi atrocities. In 1968, only four years prior to the publication of “The Terror of War,” hundreds of unarmed civilians were massacred at Mỹ Lai. The extensive photographic documentation of the slaughter was made public the following year when William Calley Jr. was court-martialed. In On Photography, Susan Sontag mused on whether the American public would have more vociferously opposed the Korean War if had been confronted with the photographic barrage that came with Vietnam. Sontag ultimately dismissed the possibility, concluding instead that the Vietnam War had already been “defined by a significant number of people as a savage colonialist war” and that the photographs — many of which had a military origin and “were taken with quite a different use in mind” — were published by the media in a preexisting social context and narrative. No photo could launch an antiwar movement; rather, the movement captioned the photo.\n\nToday, mass civilian murders and war crimes have been robustly documented by both local and international photojournalists in Gaza, Mariupol, and Goma. If the notion that a single image could change the world in 1972 is suspect, it seems all the more implausible in today’s information environment, where the ease of online dissemination and more sophisticated image creation, editing, and generation tools subjects us to a merciless barrage of content. At the 24-hour online cinerama, all military carnage is rendered mundane, though some atrocities are branded more mundane than others.\n\nMeanwhile, the Napalm Girl photograph continues to haunt First Amendment law. As recently as 2022, an Indiana state appellate judge referenced the photograph in a dissent on a child pornography conviction. Lawyers, as a class, might be criticized for a medical dependence on hypotheticals, but the Napalm Girl photograph is not just a holster-ready gotcha to foil attempts at regulating nonconsensual image capture and proliferation. Rather, like many edge cases, it helps us think: despite it unquestionably violating most people’s social mores, most people would also agree on the photograph’s historical significance.\n\nAs an edge case, “The Terror of War” elicits something unworkably tautological about trying to determine whether an image is important enough to override a general prohibition on child nudity. If “historical significance” is a criterion, the Napalm Girl’s photograph will only become compoundingly more significant the longer it survives and the more it is referenced. And the longer the Napalm Girl is the standard, the more impossible it becomes to supplant it as the premier edge case. Even as the particulars of the Vietnam War blur and fade away from American memory, the photograph collects tenure in its role as a standard of historical import. Content moderation policies will evolve and change — that is the nature of content moderation, after all — but the photograph of Kim Phúc Phan Thị will remain, a guidepost by which speech is measured."}

This bruise has been fairly consistently on that hand for months, and has sparked concerns about his health.

Each season, a romantic psychopath named Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) moved to a new place and projected his fantasies on a new woman, only to attain her and find himself dissatisfied with the flesh-and-blood person in front of him. Why were these women not flattered by his willingness to kill for them? (Never mind that some of those murder victims were their friends and family.) Why did they feel the need to exert their own wills? They, inevitably, needed to be locked up. From there, their fates were sealed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn this final season, a woman ridiculously nicknamed Brontë (Madeline Brewer) purposefully attracts Joel’s attention. A onetime student of Joe’s Season 1 victim Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail), Brontë tries to entrap Joe and prove his guilt, only to briefly doubt he could truly be evil and fall for him. The writers apparently intend for Brontë to be a stand-in for the audience: A woman who knows Joe’s murderous past but is simultaneously susceptible to his charm. They also grant her the reward of executing the ultimate punishment for Joe: Shooting off the misogynist’s manhood, humiliating him in a public trial, and sentencing him to a fate worse than death for a self-styled romantic—a lonely life spent in a prison cell. If that all sounds rather blunt, it’s because You dispenses with any sense of subtlety in its final season. The show assumes its audience—like Brontë—forgets that Joe, a serial killer whose modus operandi amounts to locking people in a box, is a bad guy, or that the love he professes to have for his female victims is really just a violent, obsessive form of objectification. Which left two of its longtime fans on the TIME culture team feeling a bit disappointed and condescended to. So, after groaning our way through the finale, we regrouped for a postmortem.\n\nPenn Badgley in You Clinton Prescod—Netflix\n\nJudy Berman: I was an early fan of You, back when it was airing on Lifetime and no one seemed to know it existed, before it showed up on Netflix and became such a hit that the streamer saved it from cancellation. Seasons 1 and 3, in particular, strike a really exhilarating balance between twisted thrills and social satire—but I even had fun with the weaker seasons. So it pains me to say that I found these last 10 episodes to be a repetitive slog, culminating in a scoldy, didactic finale that insulted my intelligence. “No, really, serial killer Joe Goldberg is a bad person” is not exactly the mind-blowing revelation it’s presented as being throughout Season 5.\n\nIn retrospect, the writing was on the wall by the fifth episode, when Joe and his new “you,” Brontë, talk about the dark romance genre and she insists, “I am not your trope.” It’s like she’s speaking right to the viewer. Though there were plenty of twists left to come, that was the moment I realized the show was preparing to sacrifice its sharp wit in order to leave viewers with a Very Important Lesson. Eliana, at what point in the season did you start to despair? Eliana Dockterman: I was frustrated from the first episode. Each season, Joe has wormed his way into a different elite group—New York literary society, L.A. wellness gurus, suburban Stepford Wives, the landed gentry of England—and skewered that particular genre of wealthy folks. It was hard not to delight in Joe’s murdering sprees when the focus of his ire was so often on the entitled and cruel—even if innocent people died along the way.\n\nThis meandering final season did not have a specific group as its target. Instead, it turned an accusatory finger at the audience for indulging in Joe’s past exploits. The writers assumed a lack of sophistication from the audience—that we cannot at once enjoy an “eat the rich” narrative and acknowledge that misogynistic serial killers are bad people—that frankly felt a little insulting. Badgley has made no secret of the fact that he was discomfited by fans online begging Joe Goldberg to lock them in cages. But Season 5 of the series takes these thirsty tweets at face value rather than with the sense of irony with which they were likely written. And so Joe gets punished in the most literal way possible. Let’s just say it, in the finale, Joe is shot in the penis. Subtle!\n\nJoe Goldberg's famous basement box Netflix\n\nJB: That was bonkers. And of course we had to then see people on the internet roasting Joe for, er, losing a few inches… or whatever the actual damage was. As if we couldn’t have figured out on our own that this is a guy whose sexual exploits deserve nothing but our derision. To go back to what you were saying about past seasons, one of the things I always liked about You was that it was smart enough—and it trusted its audience to be smart enough—to satirize more than one thing. On one hand, you had these sendups of rich, elitist social worlds that made Joe’s murder sprees kind of frictionless. And in later seasons there was the added element of genre parody; Season 3 took the piss out of Real Housewives/Desperate Housewives type entertainment, while Season 4 spoofed the Agatha Christie-style whodunits that have been everywhere over the past few years. At the same time, especially in Season 1, you had the character of Joe as a thought experiment: What if the bookish, hopelessly devoted guy—like Badgley’s own breakout character, Gossip Girl’s Dan “Lonely Boy” Humphrey—who is the hero of so many rom-coms were a real person? Wouldn’t he be kind of a delusional, nightmare stalker? Put all those elements together, and the show remained fun and witty and insightful despite all of its darkness because viewers never got attached to any one character.\n\nSeason 5 broke that pattern by speaking solely to the contingent New Yorker critic Emily Nussbaum has called “bad fans”—viewers who fundamentally misunderstand the shows they love by actually rooting for psycho protagonists like Breaking Bad meth kingpin Walter White. Are there really women out there who want Badgley to put on his Joe Goldberg cap and choke them? Probably! But, as you said, Eliana, most of the chatter to that effect surely comes from fans who a) have a sense of humor about what often used to be a very funny show; and b) understand the difference between fantasy and reality. So why would you end a great run with an utterly humorless lecture to a small group of bad fans? Breaking Bad and The Sopranos and Mad Men didn’t need to condescend to their viewers, and neither does You.\n\nFrom left: Madeline Brewer, Penn Badgley, and Tom Francis in You Season 5 Idris Solomon—Netflix\n\nED: My theory is someone came up with the final monologue of the series, and they constructed the entire season around getting Joe to a place in which he could utter that last line. The series ends with Joe Goldberg sitting in prison reading a lusty fan letter. He muses, “Why am I in a cage when these crazies write me all the depraved things they want me to do to them? Maybe we have a problem as a society. Maybe we should fix what’s broken in us. Maybe the problem isn’t me. Maybe it’s you.” Cue: Radiohead’s “Creep.” Again, subtle. Not only does Joe outright state the thesis of the show for anyone too busy folding laundry or cooking dinner to have paid attention to the last five seasons, but he says the title of the show! Out loud! Get it?? Someone got too excited by that prospect. What did you think of this coda, Judy? JB: I hated it, Eliana. Hated it. Not because I don’t think there’s any truth to it. Joe’s final voiceover is so broad and vague and easy that you can’t really argue with it. Obviously “we have a problem as a society.” We have many of them, no small number of which cluster around the eons’ worth of ambient misogyny that shaped norms around heterosexual love! Obviously we all need to do some introspection about this stuff. This is, in fact, the basic premise from which You sprang, not the destination it should’ve reached after a fully circular five seasons.\n\nThere’s a somewhat more specific line in this vein earlier in the finale, when Brontë and Joe are having their final showdown in the woods. “The fantasy of a man like you is how we cope with the reality of a man like you,” she tells him. I think there’s actually something worth considering in what she’s saying there. It made me flash back to Joe killing Clayton, who was supposed to be Brontë’s ally in taking down Joe but couldn’t restrain himself from trying to hurt her once their plan went sideways. Do women obsess over serial killers and vampires and “fairy smut” (as Joe calls it at one point in the season) because there’s so much violent misogyny in the world that we find ourselves drawn to the violent misogynists who promise to cherish and protect us? For me, that line begins to express an idea the season could’ve explored with depth and nuance. It could’ve shown how that sort of Stockholm Syndrome psychology manifests rather than just telling us about it, as an afterthought. I found that to be a real missed opportunity.\n\nPenn Badgley and Frankie Demaio in You Season 5 Netflix\n\nED: I am intrigued by that theory about why women are attracted to stories of true crime and would have happily watched an exploration of that topic. But the show feels like a remnant of the #MeToo era in which it premiered—one in which toxic men masquerading as nice guys were something we’d just started discussing rather than an omnipresent political force.\n\nIn that vein, I want to touch on Joe’s son, Henry. As a person currently pregnant with a boy, who doomscrolls articles about the growing influence of the “manosphere” before she falls asleep at night, I’m deeply interested in—and anxious about—how boys are drafted into the online toxic hellscape. Henry commits an act of violence early in the season, and the implication is he’s picking up on his dad’s anger. I wish Henry’s psychology had been explored more, but ultimately he’s largely relegated to pawn status in the legal battle between Joe and his wife. I guess not every show can be Adolescence."}

Since then Microsoft has begun backing away from its Copilot app, and this week the company is promising that Copilot won’t even launch when you tap the key — just a subset of the app will.\n\nThis “new experience” for Copilot won’t feature the full-fledged Copilot app. Instead, Microsoft is promising that the Copilot key — or, in future, the WIN+C shortcut — will launch Copilot Chat, a small chat box that won’t take up as much screen space as before.\n\nCool, right? But even this new experience isn’t free from Microsoft’s fragmentation problems, which puts separate features on separate tracks. Microsoft has two Copilot experiences: the “consumer” version of Copilot, and the more professional Copilot experience as Microsoft 365 Copilot. This week, Microsoft began reworking that latter version of Copilot to bring it more in line with the consumer application, which allows for image creation. Microsoft 365 Copilot is adding project-based Notebooks and other features, such as improved AI search and an “agent store” for sending out AI to do more specific tasks.\n\nIt’s Microsoft 365 Copilot that’s receiving the less obtrusive interface. In May, Microsoft said it will launch “an updated Copilot key experience,” which will launch a “prompt box” using Copilot Chat. While the app can be expanded into the full Copilot app, it’s designed to offer a minimal interface at launch.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Chat within Windows. Microsoft\n\nIf you have a Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise PC with a Copilot key, and the Copilot key is mapped to the full Microsoft 365 Copilot app, you’ll see this behavior change, too, as part of a Windows update. Put another way, you’ll have to launch the Copilot Chat app, then launch the full-screen app if that’s the way you work. (If you’ve already mapped the Copilot key to some other app or function, that won’t change.) It’s not clear what will happen to the Alt+Space shortcut.\n\nMicrosoft’s blog post says that the key changes are being pushed to “organizations,” implying that business customers may be the first group to receive the change. But it wouldn’t be surprising if it migrated into the consumer space, too.\n\nWindows Copilot for consumer PCs is a much more obtrusive interface.\n\nMicrosoft has waffled between making Copilot a web app, and then a native one; and the Copilot key can now be remapped to other functions on consumer PCs, too. Microsoft probably correctly feels that businesses don’t want an omnipresent Copilot app taking over their screen when they tap the Copilot key. But there’s sure to be a set of consumers who feel the same way, too."}

Firefly went live that September based upon a credit plan, allocated by how much you already paid Adobe for apps like Photoshop or a full-fledged Creative Cloud subscription. Adobe then turned to text-to-video earlier this year, with the available payment plans offering just a few brief snippets of video in exchange for a monthly fee. It’s this video service which has now launched via Firefly for the web, Adobe said.\n\nAdobe has stepped lightly through the ideological minefield that is AI art; some creators who use Adobe’s tools have spoken out quite loudly against the use of machine-generated art, but Adobe’s images come with a disclaimer that they were in fact produced by AI. Today, Adobe is launching a beta of a Content Authenticity app that allows creators to verify their identity, and to attach whatever information they would like to their profile and social media accounts. More importantly, they can include a tag that indicates that they don’t want generative AI to train on their work.\n\nAdobe Firefly’s drop-down menu allows users to select different generative AI models. Adobe\n\nAdobe said that Firefly now offers two new models, a hyper-realistic Firefly Image Model 4, and a detailed Firefly Image Model 4 Ultra. But users can also select non-Adobe models like GPT image generation and Google’s Imagen 3, and Veo 2 video models. Runway, Pika, Luma, Ideogram, and Fal.ai are coming soon, Adobe added.\n\nAdobe is also adding “boards” to Firefly, where users can drop in a number of visual ideas and use them as a source for their next creation. In a demonstration, an Adobe executive showed how two images on a board could be “mashed up” — Firefly sampled two images, then used AI to combine them.\n\nUsers can mash up two different images in the new Firefly Boards, creating a hybrid prompt to generate something new. Adobe\n\nIn Photoshop, Adobe is adding Composition Reference, a tool we’ve seen elsewhere; the tool uses how the objects in one scene are arranged as a reference guide for a second scene. Photoshop is also adding tools to Select Details like hair or facial features, and a new color adjustment tool, as well. Lightroom is adding a new Select Landscape tool, too.\n\nThe Generative Extend features in Premiere Pro are also being rolled out, too. Generative Extend is like a Photoshop’s generative features that allow the user to “extend” the scene; in video, Premiere will add additional small AI-generated clips to prolong a shot. Caption Translation will provide captions in up to 27 languages, while a Media Intelligence tool provides better search capabilities in existing footage."}

The redesigned Microsoft 365 Copilot app now has access to OpenAI’s impressive GPT-4o model, which was released last month, via Copilot Create. This means you can now generate cutting-edge images, videos, and other content.\n\nAnother big feature update is Notebooks, which are project-based notebooks for organizing information like files, pages, and links, which can then be shared with Copilot. This gives Copilot a more focused collection of context to work with, which then informs its answers when you use Copilot for aid in a given project.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nOther improvements include a better AI search that integrates with third-party platforms like Google Drive, Slack, and Jira; an improved chat interface that now remembers past conversations and can customize responses based on your work patterns and preferences; and an Agent Store for quick access to AI agents from both Microsoft and third parties.\n\nNote that Microsoft 365 Copilot is not the same thing as regular Copilot. The former is intended for business use cases while the latter is for personal use by individual consumers. The two are different, but this update does bring the user interface of Microsoft 365 Copilot more in line with what you’ve likely seen in Copilot itself."}

However, there might be one big feature that Google has kept under the wraps until now. A report reveals that Google might bring major improvements to parental controls for web content.\n\nAndroid 16 could get Family Link-powered parental ‘Supervision‘ controls for web content\n\nTo improve the Parental Controls feature on Android, Google seems to be developing a brand new menu called Supervision in the Settings app, and this was reported by Android Authority. It currently features two things: Use Device Supervision toggle and Web Content Filters.\n\nThe Use Device Supervision toggle is disabled by default. To enable it, you need to set a new PIN for the supervised account. Then, you can enter the Web Content Filters option. It allows all web content by default, but you can set it to block explicit content, including images, links, and text. Like most web content filtering systems, it might not block all explicit content.\n\nThis new section's description mentions “content restrictions & other limits,” which means Google might bring more options to it in the future. And that could be the reason why Google kept it hidden in all Android 16 beta releases. The fully baked version of the feature could be showcased with the stable release of Android 16.\n\nOne UI 8 could bring Supervision feature for better parental controls\n\nSamsung has already started working on One UI 8 (based on Android 16), and it could include these Parental Controls improvements. While One UI 7 brought improved parental controls, it doesn't have a Supervision option directly in the Settings app."}

Using a pair of AR glasses from XReal, Sightful’s Spacetop AR platform surrounds you with a gigantic 100-inch virtual screen so that you can work on a virtual “multi-monitor” setup virtually anywhere. The primary appeal is to help you work in a cramped environment like a plane or a hotel room, where the virtual workspace offers you some of the advantages of a home office.\n\nIn 2023, Sightful showed off the Spacetop, which was like a Chromebook without a display. Sightful now utilizes the xReal Air ultra 2 AR glasses in place of the previously tethered AR glasses. If you didn’t own multiple displays and a Thunderbolt dock, fine — the AR setup surrounded you with virtual displays.\n\nToday’s Spacetop Bundle makes some changes, though the concept remains the same. Instead of AR glasses that were essentially tethered to the computing solution, Sightful uses the XReal Air Ultra 2 AR glasses instead. The most significant change involves the computer: you’ll need a laptop with an NPU of some sort (a Copilot+ PC isn’t necessary, but a basic NPU like a Core Ultra 100 series is) to power the Spacetop app itself. Yes, Spacetop is now a subscription-based application that runs on top of Windows, and it’s $200 per year.\n\nThe old Sightful Spacetop. Sightful\n\nThe Xreal Air Ultra 2 AR glasses output at 1080p per eye, at up to 120 Hz, with three dimming levels so that you can essentially block out extraneous light. Custom lenses are available: prescription single-lens inserts cost $50, while prescription progressive lenses cost $150. Unfortunately, you can’t wear glasses with the Spacetop/XReal headset.\n\nThis concept might sound a bit like Apple’s Vision Pro — but Spacetop’s AR glasses from Xreal weigh 83 grams, while Apple’s headset weighs up to 650 grams. That’s a neck cramp waiting to happen.\n\nYes, it’s a hefty price: the $899 Spacetop Bundle includes the AR glasses and a year’s worth ($200) of the Spacetop subscription. But you’ll need to either buy or own your own laptop on top of that, too. Sightful has been selling preorders of the bundle for $950, with a two-year Spacetop subscription offering for $1,050. (The subscriptions renew at $200 per year.)\n\nSpacetop running on a Windows machine. Sightful\n\nWork on the road and in the air\n\nSpacetop aims to enable you to bring an office-like environment with you wherever you go, utilizing AR technology. We’ve heard this concept before: part of Meta’s ill-timed metaverse push around the Meta Quest Pro was a virtual workspace, where you were surrounded by virtual screens. It didn’t work, in part because the screens were simply too low-resolution to be useful, and the headset was too heavy. Likewise, Microsoft’s original HoloLens, which I loved, was paired with a Microsoft Mixed Reality headsets — which bombed — but included an ability to pin “screens” inside of a workspace that could remain persistent while you walked around.\n\nSpacetop combines elements of both. It not only allows you to move and pin applications on what the company calls a 100-inch virtual screen but also set up a “travel mode” where the screens move with you as you move around. All of that happens via the NPU.\n\nAt CES 2025 in January, Sightful representatives informed me that the company shifted its strategy in 2024, following the introduction of the Copilot+ PC and the NPU in general. They also announced plans to launch the Spacetop later that year in May 2024. On the Spacetop’s laptop, the NPU simply offloads some of the functions that were previously assigned to the CPU and the GPU — it fits within the traditional role of the NPU, which is to perform some AI-specific tasks much more efficiently than elsewhere. The idea is that efficiency translates into longer battery life.\n\nEarly customers also didn’t like that the first Sightful iterations were essentially Android phones, with no ability to run Windows apps. It’s not entirely clear whether you’ll be able to run Chrome, or Edge, or a browser with plugins, let alone take a Zoom call while your face is obscured by a headset.\n\nThe question is, will such a specialty device take off? Spacetop’s launch seemed less certain a couple of years ago, essentially requiring a specialized device for plane use. But now it looks much more useful as just another Windows app combined with a laptop and AR glasses that you can store in your carry-on."}

The ProSecure NVR supports a total of 16 connected cameras.\n\nThe ProSecure NVR arrives in various packages that combine bullet PTZ and turret-style cameras. (The author is pictured in an unsuccessful attempt to boost a package.) Ben Patterson/Foundry\n\nIn addition to PoE cams, the Zigbee-enabled HomeBase Professional S1 can connect to everything from Eufy keypads and smoke detectors to video doorbells and water leak sensors. During a presentation in New York on Wednesday, Eufy ticked off such compatible devices as the Keypad E10, the Entry Sensor E20, and the Motion Sensor E20; whether other legacy Eufy devices will connect to the HomeBase Pro remains to be seen.\n\nThe HomeBase Professional S1 also features 4G cellular connectivity and 24-hour battery backup power, good for keeping the unit running and connected to the internet during broadband and/or power outages.\n\nThe HomeBase Professional S1 4G cellular connectivity plus 24-hour battery backup power. Ben Patterson/Foundry\n\nBut what Eufy is really touting for these new security systems is their AI abilities, including a “private” local AI agent that not only processes what’s happening on your live feeds but also proactively warns you if it suspects a crime is in progress.\n\nThe AI agent considers factors such as whether a detected person is doing anything “suspicious,” such as shining a flashlight in your car window or checking handles for unlocked doors. The agent can also differentiate between a “friendly’ delivery person and a porch pirate by checking their clothing and “posture,” Eufy says.\n\nIf the AI agent thinks there’s a sufficient threat, it can take a range of actions, from sounding the camera’s onboard siren to calling or texting the user.\n\nOn the HomeBase Professional S1, the local AI agent can also be paired with ExpertSecure, which Eufy is billing as the first 24/7 professional monitoring service to combine human responders with AI. In other words, given a high enough threat level, your AI agent could contact a flesh-and-blood ExpertSecure responder with details about a security event.\n\nIf the AI agent thinks there’s a sufficient threat, it can take a range of actions, from sounding the camera’s onboard siren to calling or texting the user. Ben Patterson/Foundry\n\nThere is a catch to the AI functionality of the ProSecure NVR and HomeBase Professional S1, however; the advanced AI agent abilities won’t be available at launch. Instead, they’ll arrive later this year in the form of a self-installable Qualcomm Snapdragon AI chipset upgrade.\n\nThis news story is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best home security cameras.\n\nThe ProSecure NVR is up for pre-order now in configurations ranging from $999 to $1,299. Pricing and availability for the HomeBase Professional S1 and the ExpertSecure service will be announced at a later date, Eufy says.\n\nUpdated on April 25, 2025 to change the name of the HomeBase Professional S1. Initial press materials from Eufy referred to the unit as the “Homebase Pro,” but the brand subsequently renamed the product."}

This is especially important for gamers, as keeping the graphics drivers up to date can significantly boost performance.\n\nUnlike other hardware drivers, which may only offer minor updates, graphics card driver updates often introduce big changes. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel regularly release new drivers that contain significant performance improvements, bug fixes, and optimized functions.\n\nApps like Nvidia App automatically check for driver updates.. IDG\n\nTechnologies such as the DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling function also benefit from such optimizations. But even if you don’t play games and hardly need 3D graphics performance, you shouldn’t neglect driver updates–after all, the updates often fix bugs.\n\nYou can easily check your graphics card model in Windows System Information. IDG\n\nTo ensure that your drivers are up-to-date, first identify your graphics card. To do this, open “System Information” on your PC by typing the term in the Windows start menu. In the “Display” section under “Components,” you’ll find information on the model of your graphics card.\n\nIf you’re using a laptop with Intel, Nvidia, or AMD graphics, your system may automatically switch between integrated and dedicated GPUs depending on the workload. If that’s the case, then you should definitely update the drivers to maximize gaming performance.\n\nDownload the drivers directly from the manufacturer’s website. Here, you can either manually select your graphics card model or use the on-site tool to detect your hardware. Alternatively, programs such as Nvidia’s “Nvidia App” or AMD’s “Adrenalin Edition” offer practical functions like automatic updates and game optimization. Intel’s “Graphics Command Center” provides similar services.\n\nThe graphics card driver in particular should always be kept up to date. In this way, you can ensure that you get the maximum performance from the hardware and rectify or prevent errors. Leetdesk\n\nKeep in mind that older graphics cards will eventually stop receiving new driver updates, as manufacturers typically prioritize current models. So, if your graphics card is older than five-years-old, you shouldn’t expect major performance improvements. That said, it’s still worth checking for updates from time to time to ensure stability and compatibility."}

It’s about crafting a narrative that resonates with the people you hope to reach.\n\nMastering your message is an activity in:\n\nUnderstanding your audience. Communicating that understanding through content.\n\nThis is an important undertaking because your core message becomes the foundation upon which all your content, marketing materials, and campaigns propagate.\n\nTo master your message means to fundamentally understand what your brand is about, why that matters to prospective customers, and what unique point of view you bring to the market.\n\nThen, and only then, you’ll have a framework from which to build your larger brand marketing strategy.\n\nRead More: 4 SEO Copywriting Tips For Sharper, More Effective Copy\n\nThe Master Your Message Framework\n\nThe “Master Your Message” framework, as I’ll refer to it here, is one I stumbled across through professional ties with an expert copywriter, Tori Reid.\n\nReid defined and mastered the art of crafting a compelling message that gets readers to take notice.\n\nOnce you put the principles into practice, you’ll inevitably find nuances that work best for you and your clients.\n\nHere’s the Master Your Message framework at its core:\n\n1. Audience Insights\n\nPeople will tell you what they care about if you ask them.\n\nAudience research is essential when it comes to defining your “why” and, ultimately, your messaging.\n\n2. Consistency\n\nYou need to show up with the same core message in a familiar tone of voice, no matter where you post content online.\n\nWhether it’s a blog article, a Facebook ad, or a LinkedIn post, your audience should know that the root of your message is ultimately the same. They should come to expect the same values from you – every time.\n\n3. Copywriting\n\nSomething as simple as a tagline can say so much in just a few words – or it can fall flat if you don’t know what you’re doing.\n\nCopywriting takes skill. It takes practice and a particular understanding of how messaging translates into words.\n\nWhether you write it yourself or hire help, don’t underestimate the value of copywriting compared to generic content writing.\n\n4. Delivery Over Distribution\n\nCirculating your content across the web is called distribution. This pertains to the platforms you use and the means through which you push out posts, emails, etc.\n\nBut, what you should care about most is delivery: How does your content land, and are you showing up at the right place?\n\nEven the most well-crafted message won’t make an impact if it doesn’t reach the right people at the right time.\n\nYour content needs to be suited to the right platform(s), based on the behavior of your audience, while also staying true to its core essence.\n\nThese principles tell you what’s most important in messaging, but they don’t tell you how to do it.\n\nSo, now let’s talk about where the rubber meets the road.\n\nHow To Master Your Brand Message\n\nYou might think you know your message, but without audience research, split testing, and a clear market position, you could be off track.\n\nThe process below will help you get crystal clear on your brand message so you can create content and campaigns with total confidence!\n\nI recommend documenting your notes and answers along the way. You’ll use them when it comes time to apply your messaging to your brand copy.\n\n1. Know Your Product: What Are You?\n\nBefore you can start to talk about your product, you need to know what it is that you offer. This includes the literal definition of your product or service, as well as the features and appendages associated with it.\n\nFor example, if you sell a moisturizer, the description of your product might include its ingredients, texture, suitability for certain skin types, absorption rate, etc.\n\nConsider its design, application, and use cases – all the features that could be listed in its product description. Complete this activity for every product or product category.\n\nIf you offer a service, you can define your methodology, deliverables, and tools used. You could take it a step further to describe the specific use cases (though we are not talking about “benefits” yet).\n\nMany brands enter the space knowing they offer particular products or services but don’t take the time to break these down into smaller pieces (until, at least, it comes time to write the web copy).\n\nIf these aren’t clearly defined from the get-go, you leave it up to chance that your copywriter or product team will know what to highlight in your content marketing.\n\nMake their job easier. Get clear about what it is that you offer, the important features of those products or services, and the details that will eventually round out your product and service pages, ad copy, and so on.\n\n2. Own Your Purpose: Why Are You?\n\nWhy does your product or service exist? How did it come to be, and why should customers care?\n\nEvery brand has a story, whether it’s a stay-at-home mom turned small business owner, a SaaS filling a gap in the market, or an app presenting an entirely new concept to consumers.\n\nAs you might imagine, your “why” is going to differ largely from that of other businesses, even those in your immediate market and industry.\n\nYour About page is the most common example, but your foundational story also has its place in social media content, interview articles, videos, and so much more.\n\nDuring this process, define the following:\n\nFoundations: Where, when, and how was your business first started? What inspired you (or the founders) to start the company?\n\nWhere, when, and how was your business first started? What inspired you (or the founders) to start the company? Figure: Is there an individual, mascot, or character who stands for the company? When people think of your brand, what or who are they most likely to think of? Define the characteristics this character, figurehead, founder, etc., embodies.\n\nIs there an individual, mascot, or character who stands for the company? When people think of your brand, what or who are they most likely to think of? Define the characteristics this character, figurehead, founder, etc., embodies. Function: Before your brand started, what was the solution you wanted to bring to the market? How (if at all) has that purpose changed over time? Describe the primary function of your brand, whether that’s a new concept, filling a gap in the market, improving an existing product, etc.\n\nAgain, we’re not necessarily hitting on the benefits of what you offer. This is simply a practice of defining where you came from, why the brand came to be, and the purpose it initially served in its infancy.\n\n3. Define Your Difference: How Are You?\n\nDefining your difference is what helps your brand cut through the noise, especially when there are similar services and products out there.\n\nTake the world of artificial intelligence, for example. Countless AI tools have been launched, yet most blend together. Only a handful truly stand out. Why? Because they have a distinct identity or innovation that sets them apart.\n\nTo pinpoint what makes your brand different, ask yourself:\n\nWhat features/capabilities does my brand have that competitors lack?\n\nIs there a specific problem others overlook (that my brand is able to solve)?\n\nWhat about my approach, process, or values makes my brand unique?\n\nHow might my customers describe my brand compared to others?\n\nThe more you can gather real information – via customer feedback, market research, data insights, etc. – on what makes your brand different, the better.\n\nThat way, you’re capturing a sentiment that’s real rather than imagined – and, as business owners, we’re all prone to bias.\n\n4. Find Your People: Who Do You Serve?\n\nYou might have heard the saying, “When you speak to everyone, you speak to no one.”\n\nThat’s why defining who you serve is critical. And again, this is not an activity in making assumptions; it requires real audience insights, research, and feedback.\n\nFortunately, you have many methods at your disposal through which to gather audience research:\n\nCustomer Surveys: Talk directly to current and potential customers to understand their pain points, goals, and decision-making process.\n\nTalk directly to current and potential customers to understand their pain points, goals, and decision-making process. Online Communities: Monitor discussions, comments, and reviews to see what your audience is saying and what problems they’re trying to solve.\n\nMonitor discussions, comments, and reviews to see what your audience is saying and what problems they’re trying to solve. Analytics Tools: Use tools like Google Analytics to track visitor demographics, behaviors, and interests.\n\nUse tools like Google Analytics to track visitor demographics, behaviors, and interests. Competitor Research: Analyze your competitors’ audiences to identify gaps and opportunities in your market.\n\nAnalyze your competitors’ audiences to identify gaps and opportunities in your market. Sales & Support Teams: Your frontline teams interact with customers daily and can provide valuable insights into common questions, objections, and needs.\n\nOnce you’ve gathered enough insights, you can start to build a detailed persona based on the customers/clients you’re trying to reach. This persona will guide your targeting and messaging.\n\nConsider your audience’s age, gender, location, and income level. Define their usual values, challenges, and aspirations.\n\nUse analytics tools to analyze their buying behavior (how they search, compare options, or decide on a purchase). A visual representation of this data can be helpful. You might even come away with a few personas for slightly different audiences.\n\nDefining who you serve (and supporting that with real data) will help you craft messaging that resonates with the right people, driving conversions and meaningful engagement.\n\n5. Land Your Platforms: Where Do You Show Up?\n\nKnowing where your audience consumes content is crucial when it comes to delivering your message.\n\nIn most cases, your audience will demonstrate clear preferences in where they search for brands, engage with information, and converse with their community.\n\nIdentifying the right platforms based on your unique audience allows you to meet them where they are.\n\nHere are the best sources to find out where your audience spends their time online:\n\nGoogle Analytics: The “Audience” and “Acquisition” reports can show you which sources bring the most traffic to your website. This can include organic search, social media, and/or referral traffic sources.\n\nThe “Audience” and “Acquisition” reports can show you which sources bring the most traffic to your website. This can include organic search, social media, and/or referral traffic sources. Social Analytics: Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn have native analytics tools that provide insight into follower behavior. Look at the “Audience” section to see where your customers are located, their age groups, and which content they engage with most.\n\nPlatforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn have native analytics tools that provide insight into follower behavior. Look at the “Audience” section to see where your customers are located, their age groups, and which content they engage with most. Surveys (again): Use survey tools like SurveyMonkey or Google Forms to ask your audience about their online habits. Ask questions like: What social media platforms do you use most often? How do you usually find new brands or products? What type of content do you consume most frequently (articles, tutorials, reviews, etc.)?\n\nUse survey tools like SurveyMonkey or Google Forms to ask your audience about their online habits. Ask questions like: Social Listening Tools: Tools like Hootsuite, Brandwatch, and Sprout Social allow you to monitor where conversations are happening. You can see which platforms generate buzz, what topics your audience is engaging with most, and whether they are interacting with similar brands.\n\nI also recommend joining community forums like Reddit and Quora to “listen in” on what users might say about your industry, products, similar brands, etc. These are goldmines for understanding what your prospective customers are talking about.\n\nWhen in doubt, test your campaigns on different platforms to see which generates the most engagement.\n\nAlso, the nuances of each platform may influence your messaging ever so slightly.\n\nIt’s true that different content formats perform better on certain platforms, but the core of your message and your values should be the same.\n\n6. Be The Solution: Why Does This Matter?\n\nBy this step you should know:\n\nWhat you sell. Why you sell it. What makes you different. Who you sell to. Where you promote it online.\n\nUltimately, your brand is here to offer a solution to your audience’s challenges and goals.\n\nIt’s your job to build a brand that resonates with the needs of your prospective customers – that there is an inherent value in what you bring to the market (not more noise).\n\nTo master your message, get clear on the value, solution, and benefits you bring to your customers. Get crazy with adjectives.\n\nUsing the moisturizer product as an example again, your product isn’t just a moisturizer anymore – it’s a hydrating formula infused with antioxidant-rich botanicals designed to restore skin’s natural glow.\n\nThe problem the customer faces: skin lacking luster and glow.\n\nThe solution: a restorative moisturizer that’s hydrating and nutrient-rich.\n\nExplaining why all of this matters (in your own words and the words of your customers) will position your product in a way that resonates with your audience and highlights its value.\n\nWrite Brand Content That’s Right On Target\n\nMastering your message requires front-loaded work that many brands ignore. But it’s essential work if you want to grow a loyal audience, build an empire, and drive lucrative results for your business.\n\nMessaging makes all the difference.\n\nPractice this framework, and you’ll be well on your way to writing copy that’s on target, speaks to the heart of your customers, and creates a legacy for your brand.\n\nMore Resources:\n\nFeatured Image: ZoFot/Shutterstock"}

By buying Intel’s older products and not its latest chips.\n\nIntel chief financial officer David Zinsner told analysts on Thursday that Intel sold more volume in its Raptor Lake chips than Lunar Lake, suggesting that customers preferred the higher-performance Raptor Lake chips that debuted in 2023 versus the latest Lunar Lake chip that launched last September.\n\nMeanwhile, Zinsner suggested that Intel’s future is extremely uncertain due to the Trump administration’s varying economic policy. “The very fluid trade policies in the U.S. and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown, with the probability of a recession growing,” Zinsner said. “This makes it more difficult to forecast how we will perform for the quarter and for the year, even as the underlying fundamentals supporting growth I discussed earlier remain intact.”\n\nZinsner also gave an enormous range for the company’s spending plans of between $8 billion and $11 billion, because Intel doesn’t know what the future of the CHIPS Act might be.\n\nOlder, cheaper, higher-performance Intel CPUs are the favorite\n\nThe surprise, however, was how Intel’s customers are dealing with tariffs. They’re simply buying older products instead. Intel executives said that the Intel 7 process — the foundation of the Raptor Lake chips — was constrained, and so was production of the chip itself. That’s because customers are snapping up older Intel CPUs that compete with or even beat Intel’s latest parts.\n\nIntel didn’t specify whether it was desktop PC customers or laptop customers who preferred Intel’s older parts.\n\nIntel\n\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus, who returned to her role as head of Intel Products after serving as the company’s co-CEO for the period after former chief executive Pat Gelsinger stepped down, explained that customers were preferring “N-1” products, or the new code for older parts.\n\n“What we’re really seeing is much greater demand from our customers for N-1 and N-2 products so that they can continue to deliver system price points that consumers are really demanding,” Holthaus said. “As we’ve all talked about, the macroeconomic concerns and tariffs have everybody kind of hedging their bets in what they need to have from an inventory perspective. Raptor Lake plays a big role in this process.\n\n“Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake are great as well, but come with a much higher cost structure, not only for us, but at the system price points for our OEMs as well,” Holthaus added. “And so as you think about an OEM perspective, they’ve also, you know, ridden those cost curves down from a Raptor Lake perspective, and it allows them to offer that product at a better price point. So I really just think it’s, you know, macroeconomics, the overall economy, and how they’re hedging their bets.”\n\nThat’s not that surprising. The relatively anemic performance of Intel’s latest Core Ultra 200-series parts was matched by an equally anemic reception. As our Arrow Lake desktop review showed, Intel’s 15th-generation Arrow Lake desktop parts offered similar performance to Intel’s Raptor Lake generation.\n\nIntel’s Arrow Lake didn’t offer impressive performance. Adam Patrick Murray & Will Smith / PCWorld\n\nWhat does this mean for Panther Lake?\n\nMeanwhile, Intel’s readying the launch of Panther Lake and its 18A technology later this year. Lip-Bu Tan, in his first earnings call as Intel’s chief executive, said that Panther Lake would be available before the end of the year, but Zinsner said that the bulk of shipments would be in 2026. So will customers buy Panther Lake if they skipped over the previous two chips? Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon asked.\n\n“The Panther Lake launch matches exactly what we did on both Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake in regard to timing,” Holthaus said, effectively refuting that the launch would be delayed. “So it’s very aligned with how customers like to take products to market.\n\nIntel’s Holthaus holds up a “Panther Lake” sample. Mark Hachman / IDG\n\n“Panther Lake is a great product, both from a performance and price perspective for customers,” Holthaus added. “So I think you’ll see a strong uptake of that product, right? We still see very strong commercial demand for AI PCs as [customers are] deploying their fleets as they’re doing their upgrades, they want to future-proof their products and have that AI capability. So I don’t think you’re going to see that change in commercial. And if you look at our traditional ramps for these types of products, we tend to go faster in commercial first, and then consumers come on board. And so we’ll have to balance where the economy is at the end of the year, but I feel very bullish about the Panther Lake product and our customer feedback.”\n\nHolthaus said that Intel’s goal is to bring 70 percent of all the silicon used in Panther Lake in-house, or manufactured at Intel’s fabs. With Nova Lake, Intel’s 2026 processor architecture, Intel will try to move even more onto Intel foundries. “When you look at the aggregate of Nova Lake, we will build more wafers on Intel process than we are on Panther Lake,” Holthaus said.\n\nEssentially, Intel’s priorities are to build trust in Intel’s own manufacturing technologies and then extend that trust to winning more customers for Intel’s foundry business, Tan said.\n\nWhen asked how long these steps would all take, Tan demurred. “There is no quick fix,” he said.\n\nIn a note shared publicly, Tan said that Intel will “remove organizational complexity” by removing layers of management and requiring employees to work at the office four days a week or more.\n\nIntel reported a GAAP loss of $800 million on revenue that was flat with a year ago, at $12.7 billion. Intel’s Client Computing Group recorded $7.6 billion in revenue, down 8 percent from a year ago."}

It’s got a recent processor, a roomy 15.6-inch screen, and most importantly for me, 16GB of RAM. Today, Staples is selling it online for $479.99, nearly $200 off the retail price. But if you can get to a physical Staples store, you could even get it for $379.99.\n\nIt’s a tale of two product listings. See, the same laptop is listed for sale here (available for delivery only, to most places in the United States) as well as here (available for pickup at Staples retail stores that still have it in stock). If you happen to be near one, you can get it for an extra $100 off with that latter listing. The online deal is already a great price for a new, budget laptop; the local deal is downright unbeatable for the specs.\n\nThe Asus Vivobook 15 isn’t a powerhouse, but with a Core 5 120U processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, it’ll handle everything you can throw at it for basic tasks. Ordinary users and light students (don’t try to run the latest 3D games or heavy media production programs) will find it ideal. I also like that it’s got a bumper pad on the keyboard, making good use of that extra screen space.\n\nNote that it’s not a touchscreen laptop, and since it has a barrel charging port, I don’t know whether or not it’ll charge via USB-C (just one port). You do get plenty of other connection options with triple USB-A and full-sized HDMI. But these budget Asus laptops tend to have mediocre battery life at best, and there are a few other compromises that aren’t unreasonable for a laptop in this budget range.\n\nIf you happen to be near a Staples retail store, you have a chance to get a great deal here, warts and all. Otherwise, snag it online while you can. For more like this, check out our favorite laptops under $500.\n\nGet an Asus laptop with 16GB of RAM for just $480"}

Razer has tried to expand into office-style devices before, but with mixed results. Its second stab at the space includes two new mouse designs, including its first vertical mouse. Both the Pro Click V2 and Pro Click V2 Vertical are on sale today for $100 and $120, respectively.\n\nThe Pro Click V2 Vertical is definitely the more interesting design, if only by virtue of its novelty. The flat bottom and 71.7-degree tilt puts your hand into a “handshake” position with the outer edge resting on the lip of the device, a form factor you’ll no doubt recognize from other mice like Logitech’s MX Vertical. Razer seems to have borrowed the top edge and button from similar designs in this sector, and thrown in thumb buttons above and below the standard resting place.\n\nBut this is Razer we’re talking about, so naturally you get features like 30,000 DPI sensor and an RGB ring that goes nearly all the way around the base. Razer’s promo page says this can be used for “reactive RGB notifications” using the Chroma program, you know, in case you needed to justify this thing on an expense report. The battery lasts for up to six months with a USB-C recharge and it can connect over wired, Bluetooth, or 2.4GHz dongle modes.\n\nRazer\n\nThe non-vertical Pro Click 2 looks a lot more like a standard Razer mouse. You’ve got a typical “shooter” setup with two thumb buttons, but the switch above the scroll wheel can shift it from standard to “free-spin” mode, again as seen on Logitech’s MX designs, and all the better for getting through a massive spreadsheet. Razer says it’s designed for maximum comfort over long stretches with an extended thumb rest.\n\nOther features are identical to the Pro Click V2, with the exception of the battery, which lasts “only” 3.5 months. Both mice are shipping from Razer’s store right now in any color you want, so long as you want black."}

Multiple cited studies were debunked or retracted.\n\nAdvocates like Steve Kirsch cite parent-reported surveys showing a dose-response relationship between vaccines and autism rates, along with case studies of rapid-onset autism post-vaccination. Independent replication efforts are rare, raising concerns about institutional bias.\n\nWhistleblower revelations and legal cases expose repeated instances of manipulated or omitted data, such as the CDC’s 2004 study hiding elevated autism risks in Black children and Thorsen’s discredited 2002 study. Congressional testimony on these issues remains sealed.\n\nLack of transparency fuels vaccine hesitancy, with 51% of U.S. adults skeptical. Advocates demand independent research, congressional hearings on CDC misconduct, and retractions of fraudulent studies to restore confidence in public health institutions.\n\nThe debate highlights systemic issues in scientific integrity, with advocates and critics locked in conflict over suppressed evidence. Until independent reviews and transparency are prioritized, families and policymakers face unresolved questions about vaccine safety.\n\nA recent CNN headline linked to a JAMA Pediatrics study declared that children with autism are “less likely to be fully vaccinated,” a statement widely interpreted as proof that vaccines do not cause autism. However, critics argue the study’s conclusions are based on compromised research, including review articles by a problematic CDC scientist, fraudulent data and debunked studies. The backlash highlights a decades-long conflict over vaccine safety and transparency, with advocates now demanding independent replication of findings and accountability for suppressed evidence.\n\nThe flawed foundations of the JAMA study’s evidence\n\nThe JAMA Pediatrics study drew on nine prior research papers to support its claim. However, scrutiny has revealed significant flaws in its foundational evidence. Two of the cited studies were merely review articles written by William Thompson, a former CDC scientist who later admitted under oath to suppressing data linking vaccines to autism in a 2004 study. Thompson’s work omitted critical findings, such as a doubled risk of autism in African American children exposed to the MMR vaccine, according to internal communications. Another cited study was exposed as fraudulent when its lead author, Danish researcher Poul Thorsen, fled the U.S. in 2011 after being indicted for embezzling millions in research funds.\n\nMoreover, one study analysis of the MMR vaccine was revoked after subsequent CDC data undermined its conclusions, and another was discredited when correlations between vaccine schedules and autism arose in independent analyses. “These studies were never viable pillars of evidence,” said health freedom advocate Steve Kirsch, whose research identifies alarming trends in parent-reported data. “The medical establishment can’t explain away the evidence we’ve produced—and they’re desperate to avoid scrutiny.”\n\nEmerging evidence from advocates challenges vaccine safety claims\n\nKirsch’s controversial survey of 12,000 parents found a consistent link between the number of childhood vaccines and autism diagnoses. The linear relationship—more vaccines correlated with higher autism rates—aligns with statistical principles of causality. “The dose-response curve is textbook,” Kirsch noted. “This isn’t some fringe theory; it’s basic epidemiology.” Even more striking was pediatrician Doug Hulstedt’s case study: 44 instances of “rapid-onset autism” all occurred within seven days of a vaccine dose, a pattern Kirsch calculates as statistically impossible (1 chance in 1.7e13) if random.\n\nDespite the data’s complexity, replication efforts have stalled. Kirsch questions systemic bias within academic institutions. “No researcher with funding wants to challenge the status quo,” he said. Meanwhile, the AI system ChatGPT declared the evidence made a vaccine-autism link “more likely than not,” underscoring the shifting terrain of scientific consensus.\n\nA troubled history: Fraud, whistleblowers and omitted data\n\nThe controversy is part of a broader pattern. In 2015, a JAMA study ostensibly refuting the MMR-autism link actually revealed a 48% higher autism risk in vaccinated children with non-autistic siblings. Similarly, a 2004 CDC study coauthored by Thompson found a two-fold risk in Black children but omitted this in its published results. Thompson, subpoenaed to testify in Congress in 2017, was interrogated at a private hearing that was never made public—a move advocates call an attempt to bury inconvenient truths.\n\n“There’s a reason Congress was in secret,” Kirsch stated. “They’re protecting reputations over kids’ lives.” Critics also point to the New England Journal of Medicine’s 2002 study by Thorsen, which allegedly hid a 45% association between MMR and autism, and was later discredited entirely after Thorsen’s disappearance.\n\nImplications: Why this matters for public trust and health policy\n\nThe debate transcends academia. About 51% of U.S. adults express vaccine hesitancy or opposition, according to Autism Investigated. Beyond personal choice, the lack of transparency fuels systemic distrust. “When journals bury data or researchers face gag orders, it erodes faith in public health,” said Dr. Helen Ratajczak, a former CDC contractor.\n\nKirsch argues that the scientific method itself is under strain: “You can’t prove a negative—like no vaccine-autism link—because that requires infinitely disproving every possible cause.” He urges independent trials using direct parent interviews, a method most institutions avoid.\n\nThe CDC has been reluctant to address these concerns. It faces calls—led by advocates—for an open congressional hearing on William Thompson’s role, litigation over data suppression, and voluntary withdrawals of fraudulent research from journals.\n\nSeeking truth in the face of scientific conundrum\n\nAs the JAMA Pediatrics study’s credibility unravels, the urgency for honest science grows. With advocates presenting stark evidence and institutions resisting reckoning, the public is left navigating a maze of conflicting claims. “This isn’t just about vaccines,” said Dr. Jessica Rose, a physician quoted in Kirsch’s findings. “It’s about who gets to define truth when children’s futures are at stake.”\n\nUntil transparency and independent peer review prevail, the debate—rooted in errors, fraud and buried data—will continue to haunt public health discourse. For now, families, researchers and policymakers remain in limbo, awaiting answers that may demand confronting uncomfortable realities.\n\nSources include:\n\nSubstack.com\n\nTheEpochTimes.com"}

Nicole Malachowski, a 21-year veteran and the first woman to fly with the Air Force's Thunderbirds demonstration team. Rating: About this rating Outdated Context The page has since been restored to the Air Force website, with the organization citing the temporary removal as part of its efforts to \"comply with Defense Department directives while honoring our Air Force history.\"\n\nIn mid-April 2025, a rumor circulated online that an article celebrating U.S. Air Force Col. Nicole Malachowski — the first woman to fly for the Thunderbirds, the Air Force's storied air demonstration team — was removed due to President Donald Trump's administration's ongoing initiative to purge government websites of what it perceives as diversity, equity and inclusion content.\n\nAccording to the Air Force, the Thunderbirds perform flyovers and demonstrations at events such as air shows and sporting events \"for people all around the world to display the pride, precision and professionalism the U.S. Air Force represents.\"\n\nThe claim circulated in online forums like Reddit and social media platforms such as Facebook (archived) and Bluesky (archived), while also being picked up by news media outlets. Snopes readers also reached out to learn more about the veracity of the claim.\n\nIn short, the claim that the Air Force removed a webpage about Malachowski is true, according to an email from the public affairs office of Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, where she once held the position of commander.\n\nHowever, officials said via email that \"digital content related to Col. (ret) Malachowski's career, including the story posted to the 4 FW website, is currently being restored across all Air Force platforms following clarifying guidance from higher headquarters.\"\n\nThe specific webpage in question was an article titled \"A life in flight for first woman 'Thunderbirds' pilot,\" originally published March 19, 2013. The article described Malachowski's career, including joining the Air Force in 1996, her \"1,600 flying hours, including 185 hours of combat time in Operation Deliberate Forge and Operation Iraqi Freedom,\" her assignment to the Thunderbirds in 2005 and ultimately becoming \"commander of the 333rd Fighter Squadron at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base.\"\n\nBeginning April 16, 2025, reports surfaced that the feature no longer appeared on the Air Force website. Instead, \"DEI\" was added to the URL string and led to a \"404 — page not found\" error.\n\nThat \"DEI\" version of the URL (archived) no longer displays the \"404\" message shown in the screenshot below. In some instances, it redirects to the original article, while for other users it points to an alternate version of the page that is identical aside from \"DEI\" placed in front of the headline. Meanwhile, the original URL (which does not include the \"DEI\" addition) is displaying properly (archived) as cited by the Air Force in its statement above.\n\n(United States Air Force)\n\nThe Air Force appeared to initially delete the page as a result of the Trump administration's attempt to remove what it perceives as DEI efforts in the government and branches of the military. \"We continue to review all content under our purview to comply with Defense Department directives while honoring our Air Force history,\" a spokesperson for Seymour Johnson Air Force Base said via email.\n\nPrior to the reinstatement of the article, Malachowski spoke via email of the dangers she believed were evident in the Air Force's actions: \"If we are willing to censor the stories of service members and veterans, what else are we willing to censor? This sets a very dangerous precedent and this kind of censorship erodes democracy.\"\n\nAfter the retired pilot made appearances on CNN and CBS to address the situation and the Air Force restored the page, Malachowski followed up via direct message on Instagram to offer a new comment. \"It appears the Air Force decided to reinstate my articles this morning after getting pressure from journalist[s],\" she said. \"Well, that is nice, [but] it is not enough. There are tens of thousands of other articles, posts, photos, and videos of countless other service members and veterans that need to be restored … They must not stop with just restoring my story. They must restore every service member and veteran[']s story.\"\n\nMalachowski's temporary erasure from a government website is becoming a familiar pattern in the early months of Trump's second term in the Oval Office. Official government pages have purged a variety of historical information on the grounds that it fell into the opaque parameters of what the administration views as DEI, including erasing stories of other service members like a Black Medal of Honor recipient and a Black female Army officer who died in combat.\n\nThe deletion of such articles was not limited to service members and veterans. Snopes also covered the temporary deletion of content pertaining to historical figures such as Jackie Robinson and Harriet Tubman as well as events like the Holocaust."}

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nTwo female bonobos clasp hands during grooming, which strengthens social bonds. Credit: Melodie Kreyer / LKBP\n\nBiologically speaking, female and male bonobos have a weird relationship. First, there's the sex. It's the females who decide when and with whom they mate. They easily parry unwanted sexual advances—and the males know better than to force the issue.\n\nSecond, there's the food. It's the females who usually control high-value, shareable resources—a fresh kill, say. They feed while sitting on the ground, unthreatened, while males hover in tree branches waiting for their turn.\n\nThis freedom enjoyed by females might sound normal by our standards, but according to Martin Surbeck from Harvard University, it's \"totally bizarre for an animal like a bonobo.\" Bonobo males are larger and stronger than females, which gives them the physical upper hand to attack, force matings, and monopolize food.\n\nThe work is published in the journal Communications Biology.\n\nLike almost all other social mammals with larger males, bonobo societies should be dominated by males. And yet, bonobo females famously maintain a high social status compared to their larger male counterparts. Until now, though, nobody knew how this paradoxical dynamic was possible at all.\n\n\"There were competing ideas for how,\" says MPI-AB's Barbara Fruth, who has led the LuiKotale bonobo research station for 30 years, \"none of which had ever been tested in wild bonobos living in the jungles in which they evolved.\"\n\nFemale solidarity as a tool for power\n\nNow, a study by Surbeck and Fruth has delivered the first empirical evidence from wild bonobos explaining the rare phenomenon: females maintain power by forming alliances with other females. The study found that females outranked males when they formed gangs, which the authors named \"coalitions.\"\n\nIn the vast majority of coalitions—85% of those observed—females collectively targeted males, forcing them into submission and shaping the group's dominance hierarchy.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that female solidarity can invert the male-biased power structure that is typical of many mammal societies,\" says Surbeck, the study's first author. \"It's exciting to find that females can actively elevate their social status by supporting each other.\"\n\nA window to wild bonobos\n\nAn international team of researchers compiled 30 years of data from six wild bonobo communities across three field sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is the only country where bonobos live in the wild.\n\nThe dataset included observations of 1,786 conflicts between males and females. The researchers analyzed the outcome of these conflicts—of which 1,099 were won by females—together with a range of social and demographic data. By doing so, they unearthed clues as to what influenced \"female power,\" which they defined as all the factors that tip the outcome of a conflict.\n\n\"You can win a conflict by being stronger, by having friends to back you up, or by having something that someone wants and cannot take by force,\" says Surbeck.\n\nThe team had some early hunches as to where the results would point. Surbeck was sure that female domination was driven by reproductive strategies, such as hidden ovulation, which prevent males from monopolizing mating opportunities. The result of coalition formation came as a surprise.\n\nAdult females are unrelated immigrants from different communities who did not grow up together, which makes their deep bonds and cooperation unexpected. Surbeck, who runs the Kokolopori bonobo research station, adds, \"You just don't see coalitions forming that much in the wild.\"\n\nBut when coalitions form, they make an impression. The first sign is screaming so unbearably loud \"you have to block your ears,\" says Fruth. It's hard for scientists to know what triggers a coalition as they form within seconds of an event, such as if a male attempts to hurt young. The target male is followed through trees by screaming females who can sometimes cause fatal injuries.\n\n\"It's a ferocious way to assert power,\" adds Fruth. \"You know why these males don't try to overstep boundaries.\"\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter—daily or weekly.\n\nNot always 'dominance'\n\nBut the wide-ranging study, which compared six bonobo communities, laid bare previously unknown nuances in the famed dominance of females. While females in the study won 61% of conflicts and outranked 70% of males on average, this dominance was \"by no means the rule,\" says Fruth. Rather, female dominance varied in populations along a spectrum.\n\n\"It's more accurate to say that in bonobo societies, females enjoy high status rather than unchallenged dominance,\" she says.\n\nFemale coalitions are just one mechanism likely to drive the empowerment of female bonobos, the authors say. Female reproductive autonomy almost certainly changes power relations between the sexes.\n\nThe fertile window of females is hidden from males, who gain more by trying to stay near females than by aggressively coercing them to mate. Testing this and other ideas are topics of future research.\n\nDeeper questions linger, but their answers might forever remain elusive.\n\nFruth says, \"I'm still puzzled why, of all animals, bonobos were the ones to form female alliances. We might never know, but it gives me a glimmer of hope that females of our closest living relatives, in our evolutionary line, teamed up to take the reins of power alongside males.\""}

It increases the ammunition that we need when we are trying to convince people to make changes.\n\nA recent Research Letter in JAMA Internal Medicine looked at what happens when the EHR was changed to default to a 90-day supply of a particular medication that is used to treat a chronic condition. In the literature, previous studies show that 90-day prescriptions are linked to greater medication adherence and reduced mortality, so getting an adequate supply to patients is a significant benefit.\n\nTo no one’s surprise, the change in the default led to an increase in the number of patients who were prescribed a 90-day supply. The authors noted that before the intervention, the patient groups that were least likely to receive a 90-day supply included Hispanic patients, non-Hispanic black patients, those on Medicaid, and those with ZIP codes whose median household incomes is lower than $50,000.\n\nAfter the change, all of those groups were equally likely to receive the recommended 90-day prescription except for Hispanic patients, and even then the gap for those patients decreased. The recommendation to prescribe 90-day supplies with a year’s worth of refills to patients who have stable, chronic conditions has been there for decades, but a lot of prescribers still don’t do it. I’m glad to have one more tool in my belt when I try to convince people to do the right thing.\n\nI recently started studying French. As part of that, I’m making a point to read articles from European sources. I was excited to learn about Robeauté, which is creating microrobots to aid in neurosurgery. The devices are the size of a large grain of rice and are shaped a bit like protozoa. The company’s goal is to use them for minimally invasive brain surgery procedures.\n\nThe company has only raised $29 million, so my guess would be that they aren’t as far along as others might expect them to be given the typical trajectory for and cost of development of a new medical device. One of the sources that I saw mentioned the potential for a clinical trial in 2026 with a focus on brain tumors, using the devices to take micro biopsy samples. Thus far, they have been using sheep for preclinical trials as they measure the safety and effectiveness of the devices.\n\nI spent the majority of my clinical time in emergency and urgent care, so I’ve experienced the phenomenon of emergency department boarding first hand. It’s a problem that hospital executives work diligently to solve, although the causes are multifactorial and you often have to make many adjustments to see improvement. It’s exacerbated by nursing shortages, housekeeping shortages, physical plant issues, and a host of other factors, including the number and types of patients arriving at the emergency department for care.\n\nA recent article in Louisville Public Media caught my eye. It mentioned the rising numbers of older patients who have dementia, noting that 50% of patients who are boarded in the emergency department are age 65 and older. As the US population ages, this is going to be a greater issue. Organizations should be looking at their patient demographics and forecasting how their population will age in order to begin solving the future version of this problem, which is likely to be much worse than the current state.\n\nVirtual nursing, home-based care, quicker discharges, improved staffing, streamlined discharge processes, internal float pools, telehealth, and improved advance care planning all play a role. From the healthcare IT perspective, all of them have technology components, so it’s good to learn about potential solutions if you want to expand your ability to jump into different work streams.\n\nWe’ve all heard the old adage that “time is money,” but apparently the marketing folks at my preferred parking vendor don’t value my time as much as I do. They sent an email about updates to the Parking Spot App that are “available now in the App Store and coming later this month to Google Play.” They went on to recommend that users “download these updates when available.”\n\nI guess Android users just have to keep checking back to see when the new app is available? Would it have been too much to consider sending another email when the Android version is available? Some days when you’re exhausted from travel that serves up a host of tiny annoyances, it really is the little things that matter. This detail tells me that the folks who are in charge of customer communications don’t put themselves in the customer’s shoes anywhere near what they should.\n\nI got tapped to present at a residency program’s “procedure night” event this week. My particular area of expertise is how to do procedures in environments where you don’t have the resources you woud typically have at a tertiary medical center’s emergency department. Depending on their career choices, the adjustment can be pretty significant when you move from being at a facility that has everything you need at your fingertips to one where you have to get creative to just do the basics.\n\nI’ve done a bit of wilderness first aid. I have also practiced medicine in a tent, cleaning, and stitching wounds by light of a hand-held shop light, so I’m definitely qualified to present the topic. I think some of my stories were a bit eye-opening, but hopefully will serve as inspiration to residents who are feeling a little stuck and overwhelmed as they approach the end of their training year.\n\nWe were doing some joking about practicing in alternate environments. I said that maybe I should come back and do a class on paper charting. Since the program’s faculty members are young, I’m betting that I have significantly more experience on paper charts than some of them added together. It’s a skill, and if you ever have to make your way in a downtime situation for more than a couple of hours, you might wish you had a few more skills. It’s something to consider.\n\nDoes your hospital teach about paper-based charting as part of its downtime plans, or do you just hope for the best? Leave a comment or email me.\n\nEmail Dr. Jayne."}

But smaller, more niche businesses simply can’t deal with the uncertainty of prices that might double tomorrow—so they’re out, at least as far as shipping to customers in the US.\n\nThe latest example is Keyboardio, a custom keyboard shop run by two people in California. Keyboardio specializes in the kind of gorgeous, wood-cased ergonomic designs that always draw crowds at keyboard meetups. But because essential parts like PCBs come from China, even if their wooden cases are sourced from American wood, both the standard tariffs and the crackdowns on de minimis shipping exceptions make it impossible to remain profitable for US sales, as the two explain in a lengthy blog post. The post was updated four times in three days in April to deal with the US and China’s dueling policies.\n\nBut starting May 2nd, there will simply be no way to keep sales going while remaining profitable. Keyboardio announced (spotted by Tom’s Hardware) that it will “suspend all shipping to the United States until we’re confident that your orders will get to you quickly and reliably.”\n\nKeyboardio isn’t the first small gadget supplier to make this call, and it won’t be the last. Retro Dodo reports that Anbernic—a favorite of the exploding retro handheld emulation gadget scene—announced that it would be “suspending all orders shipping from China to the United States.” Stock currently available in American warehouses will be the last available to US residents until further notice.\n\nBigger brands are feeling the pinch, too. Razer’s high-powered gaming laptops briefly disappeared from its ordering page earlier this month even as it was announcing new accessories, and Logitech’s mice and keyboards have jumped in price by up to 25 percent. Yesterday, logistics giant Hapag Lloyd says that among its customers, 30 percent have simply cancelled shipments originating from China and bound for the United States. The International Monetary Fund predicts a slowing impact to the broader global economy as companies try to account for the apparent self-sabotage of the United States buying public.\n\nRazer\n\nIf you’d like to dig deeper into how the Trump tariffs are affecting both US businesses and technology buyers, Gamers Nexus has an exhaustive breakdown available on YouTube. Notably, PC case and component maker Hyte (who’s based in California) is shutting down all shipments to the US. Hyte broke down the component, manufacturing, and shipping cost of individual cases, explaining how and why simply shifting manufacturing to the United States is economically impossible.\n\nCooler Master, Thermal Grizzly, Corsair, and CyberPowerPC all expressed similar woes, saying that the unpredictability of the tariff situation can lead to disaster. A shipment could leave port in China when the tariff rate is 20 percent but arrive when it’s 150 percent—and that alone can be so detrimental to the business that it directly results in employee layoffs. Larger companies can try to compensate with fewer products on offer shipped in bigger batches when the situation is less chaotic, but smaller companies will simply shut down sales in the US… or may be in danger of complete collapse altogether.\n\nThe full video is almost three hours long, but absolutely worth watching if you’d like to see an incredibly detailed breakdown of how US companies are being clobbered by constantly-shifting policies that are beyond anyone’s ability to predict.\n\nThe Trump administration has temporarily scaled back import tariffs from most countries to “just” 10 percent, a policy that would already have been considered a huge burden. Dozens of countries have indicated a willingness to bargain to avoid the more onerous tariffs announced earlier this year. But with China refusing to bow to Trump’s demands and several rounds of one-upmanship between the countries, the current rate on most Chinese imports to the United States is a staggering 145 percent. A television made in China and valued at $100 will be charged $145 to enter the country, effectively making its price $245.\n\nApparently, reacting to panic in the tech industry specifically, the administration later scaled back the China tariffs on computers, computer components, smartphones, and some smaller parts to “only” 20 percent. Messaging on what counts and what doesn’t, and how long these and other policies will remain in place, is confused at best.\n\nThe Trump administration claims that it is actively negotiating with China and that the tariff rate will go down substantially in the near future. Chinese officials have denied that active negotiations are occurring."}

Last fall, Disney added similar options for its Disney+ streaming service ($7 per month with ads, $10 per month without). Both companies have updated their terms of service to say that out-of-home account sharing is forbidden.\n\nBut calling this a “crackdown” is still extreme relative to the actual level of enforcement that’s happening. Let’s call them shakedowns instead, with streaming services using the occasional nastygram or sign-in nuisance to see what extra revenue they can knock loose. Don’t make it easier on them by giving in before it’s absolutely necessary.\n\nBuying some time\n\nMax and Disney+ are enforcing their password-sharing rules in pretty much the same way as Netflix, establishing a “Household” location based on signals such as your home’s IP address and device activity. They can then flag any streaming from outside of that home location as potential password sharing.\n\nIf that happens, there are ways to avoid opening your wallet right away.\n\nMax’s support page says users may see a “Get your own account” or “Transfer this profile to your own account” message when they try to access the service. In both cases, users can instead select “This is My Account” and enter a code sent to the account holder’s email address. The support page doesn’t mention any limit on how many times someone can verify an account this way, and Max did not respond to a request for clarification.\n\nDisney+ also lists several ways on its support page for users to dismiss its password-sharing warnings. In some cases, you can simply use a one-time code to verify your account. In others, you can either select “I’m away from home” or reset your household location to where you are currently.\n\nThese extra verification steps might thwart folks who don’t keep in close touch with the account holder. But for a kid who’s off to college, a child of divorced parents, or someone who’s just on an extended vacation, it shouldn’t pose much of an obstacle.\n\nTightening the screws\n\nHow Max and Disney+ proceed from here is unclear, but Netflix’s approach provides a blueprint.\n\nNetflix started enforcing password-sharing rules in May 2023, but made them fairly trivial to work around in the months that followed. It offered an “I’m Traveling” button to facilitate temporary out-of-home access, plus a way to update one’s home location with a verification code sent via email. Viewing on mobile devices is also allowed, with an extra verification code required in some cases. (Some folks even realized they could auto-forward Netflix’s verification emails to help far-flung friends or family members log in.)\n\nWhile Netflix reportedly started closing the code verification loophole toward the end of last year, it took a long time to get to that point. Instead of a sudden crackdown, Netflix has spent the past couple of years ramping up its enforcement gradually.\n\nMax and other second-tier streamers are likely to move just as cautiously, given that they already had higher cancellation rates and lower viewership than Netflix without password-sharing rules in place. For them, further reducing the value of a subscription has a greater risk of backfiring.\n\nCould you get banned?\n\nNo matter what happens next, there’s little risk in stress-testing the rules. To date I haven’t seen any evidence of Netflix account holders getting banned from the service for casual password sharing, and Netflix did not comment on whether it would ever do so.\n\nThe only company whose support documentation hints at any kind of permanent consequence for password sharing is Disney, which says there “may be a limit to the number of times you can update your Household” to a new location (Disney-owned Hulu + Live TV limits you to just four household location changes, and you can’t stream while you’re away from home at all). Still, Disney doesn’t say what its Disney+ limit is or what exactly happens when that limit is met. Disney and Max did not respond to questions on whether password sharing would ever be grounds for closing someone’s account outright.\n\nRemember, these companies don’t want to kick out legitimate customers. The whole point of password-sharing rules is to create supplemental revenue from folks who’d avoided subscribing before. Don’t feel the need to contribute unless (or until) there’s no other way around it.\n\nGet more streaming TV advice and insights with Jared’s Cord Cutter Weekly newsletter."}

With that In mind, we all have to face the fact that we are aging and that at some point, we may decide to share or pass along some of the supplies that we have accumulated. It also occurred to me that, as we age, our desire to help others may impact our survival plans.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I’ve reached the point in my life where I’ve lived longer than any of my male ancestors. And, I’m certainly not as physically capable as I was in my youth. From a purely statistical point of view, I could fall over at any moment.\n\nI think it may be of interest to your readers to think and talk about how we can help other individuals by sharing some of our supplies that we have accumulated. And, we might want to think about the best way to share with others.\n\n\n\nFor Christians, sharing charitably falls under the category of “doing good to others”. Of course, as Christians we also have to demonstrate that we are Good Stewards of the gifts that we have been given. I think this means that as we give away any of our supplies, we look for areas where we are filling a real need. However, even non-Christians may have a special interest group that they wish to help or they may want to impact society positively. Depending on what they give away, they might even get a tax credit.\n\nFor some individuals, their plans may simply be to sell any of the supplies that they feel they may no longer need. If that works for them, then that is wonderful. Other individuals may have family members to whom they wish to give their survival preparations. However, that may not work.\n\nMy wife wanted to pass along her family antiques to her nieces and nephews. However, she’s come to realize that her nieces and nephews have no interest in the family antiques. Similarly, preppers may find that their children have no interest in prepping or only want a small portion of their supplies. This could be due to space limitations or perhaps they have a spouse that doesn’t really agree with prepping principles. So, there are situations where passing along our prepping supplies to family members or friends may not work.\n\nI had planned to pass along some of my firearms to my younger brother-in-law (a former special operator). Unfortunately, when I contacted him about this, I found out that his arthritis is now so bad he has sold his ATV and was in the process of selling off all of his firearms. I also planned to pass along firearms to a friend of mine. Unfortunately, his hearing has gotten so bad he decided to no longer be involved in shooting. So, my plans to reduce my firearm collection were simply rendered moot. As we age, we have to remember that many of our friends and relatives are aging, as well.\n\nThis got me thinking about what I had done over the last couple of years as I have reduced some of my survival supplies. I’d like to share that with SurvivalBlog’s readers. As different local, regional, or international disasters have occurred I’ve been able to use my survival supplies to help others.\n\nWhere I live there is a fairly large group of individuals that are of Ukrainian ancestry. At the start of the Ukraine war, they decided to collect money, tactical supplies, and medical supplies, and take them to Ukraine. I provided some funding, gave them about half of my medical supplies, and two high-end three-day assault packs. Thinking about the donations: Will I miss the assault packs? – probably not. Will I miss the medical supplies? – I’m not really sure. Will I miss the money? – of course. (But maybe that’s not important).\n\nOf course, this might be an extreme case but there are opportunities to help others all around us. I recently donated some of my cold weather supplies (sleeping bags, blankets, and coats) to North Carolina hurricane victims. Many of the individuals in North Carolina lost their homes and are living in tents – it was starting to get cold up in the mountains. Again, these were spare cold weather supplies that I may or may not ever need them. I suspect that most people that are preppers typically have several layers of supplies to address different problems or situations that may occur over longer periods of time.\n\nAnother opportunity presented itself as a group of missionaries from my church decided to go to Columbia to work with individuals who were fleeing from Venezuela. In talking with the missionaries, I realized they had no plans for assuring water quality on their trip. I was able to give them seven Seychelle Extreme Water Filtration Bottles (for “emergency preparedness, disaster relief, and radiological contamination”). This was just another example of seeing situations where passing along or reducing some of my survival preparations could help others.\n\nOne area where individuals might consider donating some of their survival supplies might be to the Boy Scouts. Over the years I’ve had two friends that were scoutmasters of troops from low-income areas. I often go to the estate sales or yard sales to look for survival equipment, knives, axes, tools, etc. Occasionally, I found items that I could use, and I would also sometimes find items that would be useful for these scouting troops. When I found appropriate items, I would give them to the scoutmasters.\n\nOther opportunities may occur over time during our day-to-day lives. I used to work for a large industrial employer approximately 25 miles from where I lived. Most of the employees traveled a considerable distance to work for this employer. As I was going to the parking garage one day, a coworker had a flat tire. Unfortunately, he did not have a lug wrench to remove his tire. I should point out he was a former auto mechanic. However, he had no tools in his car. I helped him by loaning him my lug wrench and we changed the tire. Shortly after that occurred another of my coworkers had a flat tire (he had a nail in it) and he wanted to inflate the tire to drive home. I had a pump in my car which I loaned him, and we reinflated his tire. Note: this individual was a former Navy aircraft mechanic, and he had no tools in his car. Both of the individuals realized that they needed to add tools to their cars after these incidents. (And they got some chiding from me.)\n\nAnother opportunity developed that allowed me to use my first-aid kit. For years I have kept a relatively extensive first-aid kit in my car. I used to joke that I never used it for me but only to help other people – mostly for nicks or small cuts. However, one day I really had a chance to use the first-aid kit. As I was walking into a restaurant there was a couple with a young girl (maybe five years old) in front of me. They were having a good time, but the young girl broke away from her parents and ran toward the restaurant but unfortunately tripped and tore up her knee. She was crying and screaming and bleeding. As I walked up to her parents as they were trying to console her. I asked if they had a first-aid kit and they replied “no”. I retrieved my first-aid kit from my car and gave them the appropriate supplies so that they could help their daughter. In addition to large Band-Aids, and antiseptic wipes I was surprised to find pain-deadening wipes in the first-aid kit. I didn’t recall that I had the pain-deadening wipes. However, when the parents applied the pain-deadening wipes to the girl’s knee the pain immediately was reduced.\n\nAs they were treating their daughter’s injury, the mother looked at the husband and said: “We need to get a first-aid kit for the car”. And he said “yes”. So sometimes our actions can help other people understand the need to be better prepared. Some of the people we meet along the way might be people that we can share our supplies with as well as our desire to be better prepared as challenges arise.\n\nBy the way, we usually never know the impact we have on other individuals. However, in this case, I did receive some rather good feedback. After I put my first-aid kit away I went into the restaurant and ended up in the cashier line immediately behind the same parents and child. The child, cradled in her mother’s arms, was still crying. She looked up from her mother’s arms, saw me and immediately stopped crying. She held up the pain-deadening wipes and gave me a big smile to show that she knew I had been the one who had helped her. That was a good day.\n\nPreppers can look for areas where their generosity can have a positive impact on society. Of course, this is after we have built up our own necessary supplies.\n\nThe following is a partial listing of different categories of supplies and where they might be donated:\n\nFood that may be near the expiration date Church food pantries, Salvation Army, Judeo-Christian outreach, homeless shelters. Extra office supplies Local schools, the Franklin Graham shoebox ministry. Tools and building supplies Habitat for Humanity, Cabins for Christ (if they’re building in your area). Walkers, canes, crutches Some churches share with their congregation members. Skis, ski boots, poles, bindings. Check with the local park system to determine if they have rental/loaner equipment. You can donate and help other individuals learn to appreciate the outdoors.\n\nCertainly, the foregoing list is not all-inclusive. This is just to get SurvivalBlog readers thinking about all the different areas that might have uses for some of the items we’ve accumulated over time. And by the way, when we die, someone has to settle our estate. They sell all the stuff that we’ve gathered or try to give it away. You’ve just made their life easier.\n\nYes, it takes some effort. However, think of this as the ultimate in recycling. All of these pieces of equipment or tools may be going on to help someone that really needs them."}

Oblivion designer (plus Shivering Isles design director and Skyrim lead designer) Bruce Nesmith, who left Bethesda during the development of Starfield, has also laid eyes on the remaster, and he's blown away.\n\nIn a chat with Videogamer, Nesmith tipped his hat to the game's devs and \"a staggering amount of remastering. It almost needs its own word, quite frankly. I’m not sure 'remaster' actually does it justice.\"\n\nNesmith's amazed that the remaster touched \"every part of the game,\" taking the time to \"completely redo the animations, the animation system, put in the Unreal Engine, change the leveling system, [and] change the user interface.\" But before he saw it, Nesmith thought the re-do was going to be a pretty simple upscale.\n\n\"I was assuming this was going to be a texture update,\" he said, \"I didn't really think it was going to be the complete overhaul they've announced it to be.\" Now, he thinks the best way to describe the game is as \"Oblivion 2.0.\"\n\nPatrick Stewart has never looked so detailed. (Image credit: Bethesda)\n\nWho can blame him? The term 'remaster'—at least for me—conjures images of uprezzes and sharper textures, not the complete UE5 renovation that Virtuos created for Oblivion. It really is a remaster though; dig into those game files and you'll find most of the files for the original game, wrapped in UE5 like a fly in amber.\n\nIf you're wondering how Nesmith feels about it, he's got one word for you: \"pride.\" He says he's proud that \"A game that I worked on has the longevity to still generate interest 20 years later and to be worth the effort—it sounds like considerable effort—and time that Bethesda put into remastering it.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

または python3 --version\n\n次に、FastAPI、Uvicorn、そしてFastAPI MCPをインストールします：\n\npip install fastapi uvicorn fastapi-mcp\n\nトラブルを避けるため、まずは超シンプルなFastAPIアプリを作ってみましょう。 main.py というファイルを作成して、以下の内容を書き込みます：\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP app = FastAPI ( title = \" シンプルAPI \" ) @app.get ( \" /hello \" , operation_id = \" say_hello \" ) async def hello (): \"\"\" シンプルな挨拶エンドポイント \"\"\" return { \" message \" : \" Hello World \" } # MCPサーバーを作成 mcp = FastApiMCP ( app , name = \" シンプルMCPサービス \" ) mcp . mount () if __name__ == \" __main__ \" : import uvicorn uvicorn . run ( app , host = \" 127.0.0.1 \" , port = 8000 )\n\nこのサンプルは本当にシンプルで、 /hello エンドポイントだけを持ち、簡単な挨拶メッセージを返します。\n\nさあ、アプリを実行してテストしてみましょう：\n\npython main.py\n\nまたは：\n\nuvicorn main:app --reload\n\nサーバーは http://127.0.0.1:8000 で起動します。\n\nブラウザを開いて、MCPエンドポイントにアクセスしてみましょう： http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp\n\n注意：通常のAPIとは異なり、MCPエンドポイントはServer-Sent Events (SSE)プロトコルを使用しているため、ブラウザでは次のような出力が表示されます：\n\nevent: endpoint data: /mcp/messages/?session_id=02b22de319bb43e596ec91ed5d480411\n\nこれは、MCPサーバーが起動し、AIクライアントからのリクエストを受け付ける準備ができたことを示しています。\n\nAIクライアントでFastAPI MCPに接続する\n\n次に、MCPをサポートするAIクライアントをサーバーに接続する必要があります。Cursorを例に説明します：\n\nClaude Desktop、Cursor、Windsurfなどの主要なMCPクライアントはSSE接続をサポートしており、以下の設定形式を使用します：\n\n{ \"mcpServers\" : { \"fastapi-mcp\" : { \"url\" : \"http://localhost:8000/mcp\" } } }\n\n各クライアントで、対応する設定セクションを見つけてこの設定を追加するだけです。例えば、Cursorでは、右上の設定アイコンをクリックし、「MCP -> Add new global MCP server」に移動して、開いた mcp.json ファイルに上記のJSON設定を入力します。\n\n\n\nFastAPI MCPサービスが起動していれば、Cursorで自動的に有効になります！\n\n認証が必要な場合や、MCPクライアントがSSEをサポートしていない場合は、 mcp-remote をブリッジとして使用できます：\n\n{ \"mcpServers\" : { \"fastapi-mcp\" : { \"command\" : \"npx\" , \"args\" : [ \"mcp-remote\" , \"http://localhost:8000/mcp\" , \"8080\" // オプションのポート番号 ] } } }\n\nAIクライアントでFastAPI MCPを使用する\n\nCursorなどのAI IDEでFastAPI MCPに接続したら、対話を開始できます。例えば、Cursorのエージェントモードで「 /hello APIを呼び出して」と質問すると、AIはインターフェースの出力結果を返します！\n\n上級テクニック\n\n基本的な使い方をマスターしたら、FastAPI MCPをより柔軟に使うためのいくつかの上級テクニックを見ていきましょう。\n\nカスタムエンドポイント公開\n\n実際のアプリケーションでは、すべてのAPIエンドポイントをAIモデルに公開したくない場合があります。FastAPI MCPは、どのエンドポイントを公開するかを制御するための複数の方法を提供しています：\n\n# 特定の操作IDのみを公開 mcp = FastApiMCP ( app , include_operations = [ \" say_hello \" , \" get_user_info \" ] ) # 特定の操作IDを除外 mcp = FastApiMCP ( app , exclude_operations = [ \" delete_user \" , \" update_settings \" ] ) # 特定のタグを持つエンドポイントのみを公開 mcp = FastApiMCP ( app , include_tags = [ \" public \" , \" read_only \" ] ) # 特定のタグを持つエンドポイントを除外 mcp = FastApiMCP ( app , exclude_tags = [ \" admin \" , \" sensitive \" ] )\n\nこの柔軟性により、AIモデルが利用できる機能を正確に制御でき、セキュリティが向上します。\n\n認証保護の追加\n\n本番環境では、MCPエンドポイントを保護して、認証されたクライアントのみがアクセスできるようにしたい場合があります：\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI , Depends , Security , HTTPException from fastapi.security import APIKeyHeader app = FastAPI () api_key_header = APIKeyHeader ( name = \" X-API-Key \" ) # API鍵を検証する関数を定義 async def verify_api_key ( api_key : str = Security ( api_key_header )): if api_key != \" your-secret-key \" : # 実際のアプリケーションでは環境変数や安全なストレージを使用すべき raise HTTPException ( status_code = 403 , detail = \" Invalid API key \" ) return api_key # 認証依存関係を追加してMCPサーバーを作成 mcp = FastApiMCP ( app , mcp_dependencies = [ Depends ( verify_api_key )]) mcp . mount ()\n\nこれで、MCPサービスへのすべてのリクエストには、ヘッダーに有効なAPI鍵が含まれている必要があります。\n\nカスタムレスポンス処理\n\nAIモデルに返すレスポンスに追加情報を含めたり、フォーマット変換を行いたい場合があります：\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI , Response , Request from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP from typing import Callable , Dict , Any from datetime import datetime app = FastAPI () # カスタムレスポンスプロセッサを定義 async def response_processor ( request : Request , response : Response , response_data : Dict [ str , Any ] ) -> Dict [ str , Any ]: # メタデータの追加やレスポンスの修正 response_data [ \" processed_by \" ] = \" custom_processor \" response_data [ \" timestamp \" ] = datetime . now (). isoformat () return response_data # レスポンスプロセッサを追加してMCPサーバーを作成 mcp = FastApiMCP ( app , response_processor = response_processor ) mcp . mount ()\n\n分離デプロイ\n\n一部のシナリオでは、MCPサーバーをメインAPIサービスとは別にデプロイしたい場合があります：\n\n# api_app.py - メインAPIアプリケーション from fastapi import FastAPI api_app = FastAPI () @api_app.get ( \" /data \" ) def get_data (): return { \" data \" : \" some value \" } # mcp_app.py - 独立したMCPサーバーアプリケーション from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP from api_app import api_app # メインAPIアプリケーションをインポート mcp_app = FastAPI () mcp = FastApiMCP ( api_app ) mcp . mount ( mcp_app ) # api_appではなくmcp_appにマウント # 2つのアプリケーションを別々に実行できます： # uvicorn api_app:api_app --port 8001 # uvicorn mcp_app:mcp_app --port 8000\n\nこの方法により、MCPサービスを独立してスケーリングしたり、異なるAPIアプリケーションに統一されたMCPアクセスポイントを提供したりできます。\n\n注意事項\n\nFastAPI MCPを使用する際には、プロトコルのセキュリティに関する考慮事項があります：\n\n公開するエンドポイントを制限する：安全な読み取り専用のエンドポイントのみを公開し、システムに変更を加える可能性のあるエンドポイント（DELETE、PUT操作など）の公開を避けます。 適切な認証を追加する：認証されたユーザーのみがAIを通じてAPIにアクセスできるようにします。 リクエスト検証：FastAPIのPydanticモデルを使用して、リクエストパラメータを厳密に検証します。 レスポンスフィルタリング：特にAIモデルがこれらの情報をユーザーに表示する可能性がある場合、レスポンス内の機密情報をフィルタリングすることを検討します。\n\nまとめ\n\nFastAPI MCPの使用は本当に簡単です！Python環境さえあれば、数分でAPIをAIが呼び出せるツールに変えることができます。全体のプロセスは次のようにまとめられます：\n\nPython 3.10+（3.12推奨）をインストール 必要なパッケージをインストール FastAPIアプリケーションを作成 MCPサポートを追加 AI IDEでFastAPI MCPを実行してテスト\n\nFastAPI-MCPは、FastAPI APIをMCPツールに迅速に変換したい開発者に最適な、効率的で使いやすく、機能豊富なツールです。わずか数行のコードで統合が完了し、認証、ドキュメント保持、柔軟なデプロイをサポートしており、FastAPIエコシステムでMCPに接続するための理想的な選択肢です。\n\nFastAPI-MCPを使えば、AIとAPIの連携が驚くほど簡単になります。みなさんも是非試してみてください！質問やコメントがあれば、ぜひ共有してくださいね。一緒にAI時代の開発を楽しみましょう！\n\n参考\n\n[1] https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp\n\n[2] https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction"}

Those items were offset by $3 million in gains on equipment sales versus a small loss in the 2024 first quarter (an 11-cent tailwind).\n\nTable: Pamt Corp.’s key performance indicators\n\nConsolidated revenue of $155 million was 15% lower year over year. Roughly one-third of its annual revenue is tied to the automobile industry.\n\nThe TL segment reported a 10% y/y revenue decline as average trucks in service fell 4% and revenue per truck per week was off 5%.\n\nLoaded miles were down 7% y/y, and revenue per loaded mile fell 3% excluding fuel surcharges.\n\nThe unit booked a 110.9% operating ratio (inverse of operating margin), which was 670 basis points worse y/y. The first quarter marked the sixth straight operating loss for the unit.\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits (as a percentage of revenue) increased 210 bps y/y, and depreciation expense was 420 bps higher (both on a consolidated basis).\n\nLogistics revenue fell 25% y/y to $44 million. The segment reported a 98% OR, which was 410 bps worse y/y. The company doesn’t provide gross profit margins for the unit or operating metrics like load counts and revenue per load.\n\nThe company had an operating cash flow use of $1.4 million in the quarter versus generating $59 million in cash flow from operations for all of 2024.\n\nLiquidity (cash, equity holdings and availability on its line of credit) of $163 million at the end of the quarter was $8 million lower than at the end of 2024. Outstanding debt of $309 million was down $16 million from the end of the year.\n\nShares of Pamt (NASDAQ: PAMT) were off 1.2% at 9:44 a.m. EDT on Thursday compared to the S&P 500, which was up 0.4%.\n\nMore FreightWaves articles by Todd Maiden:\n\nThe post TL carrier Pamt books another loss in Q1 appeared first on FreightWaves."}

What really matters lies in optimizing that model to perform efficiently across a multitude of scenarios. Performance optimization plays a vital role in unlocking the full potential of your AI system, whether you are fine-tuning hyperparameters, refining your data pipeline, or leveraging advanced evaluation metrics.\n\nThis guide, the last of our three-part series about AI, offers insights to help you optimize methods and step-by-step implementation instructions for enhancing AI performance. The first two articles are linked below:\n\nUnderstanding Model Optimization\n\nEnhancing AI model performance through parameter and setting modifications is known as optimization in AI.\n\nA well-optimized model should:\n\nReach maximum precision for training datasets as well as untested test data.\n\nShow consistent performance across different datasets.\n\nRefrain from memorizing training data because it prevents the discovery of general patterns.\n\nEnable faster training operations along with reduced usage of computational resources.\n\nOptimizing a neural network involves striking the proper equilibrium between how complex it is, its training rapidity, and its forecasting capability.\n\n\n\nHyperparameter Tuning: Finding the Best Model Settings\n\nWhat Are Hyperparameters?\n\nThe external parameters known as hyperparameters regulate model training processes and the data has no effect on their determination.\n\nLearning Rate determines the speed of weight adjustment.\n\nBatch size represents the number of samples the model processes in each step of training.\n\nThe model architecture consists of several layers along with its corresponding number of neurons.\n\nOptimizer type (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, etc.).\n\nAdjusting the Learning Rate.\n\nThe Learning Rate stands as a crucial governing variable among all hyperparameters within deep learning.\n\nWhen a model update exceeds optimal values, it creates poor convergence through large adjustments of parameters.\n\nThe model learns at a slow pace since it needs prolonged training time when the Learning Rate is set too low.\n\nWith Adaptive Learning Rates, the model can initiate training with a high Learning Rate that subsequently decreases through the scheduled adjustments.\n\nPython import tensorflow as tf lr_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay( initial_learning_rate=0.01, # Start with a high learning rate decay_steps=10000, decay_rate=0.9) # Reduce learning rate over time optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=lr_schedule)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intervention inhibits too many updates during the beginning phase to let the model mature properly in subsequent stages. Optimizers serve to control the process of weight modifications during the training phase. Different optimizers have unique behaviors:\n\nOptimizer Description Best Use Cases SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) Performs well but learning rate fine-tuning is needed. Large datasets, image recognition. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) Adapts learning rate dynamically, making it efficient. NLP, deep learning models. RMSprop Performs well with noisy or corrupt datasets and recurrent networks. Speech recognition, time-series data.\n\nExample: Utilizing the Adam optimizer in Keras\n\nPython model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n\n\nFor many deep learning applications, Adam is often a solid choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegularization Techniques: Preventing Overfitting\n\nA model learns specific training data patterns to an excessive extent that it struggles with generalization. Regularization methods are used actively to avoid this condition from occurring.\n\nL1 and L2 Regularization\n\nThe method of regularization adds penalties to weight sizes, which shapes more basic models with wider accuracy ranges.\n\nL1 Regularization (Lasso) imposes sparsity by forcing certain weight values to zero while also simplifying the model complexity.\n\nThe L2 Regularization (Ridge) method reduces large weight values yet prevents weight reduction to zero.\n\nExample: We apply L2 regularization to a dense layer.\n\nPython from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import l2 model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01)))\n\n\n\n\n\nDropout: Randomly Deactivating Neurons\n\nDuring training sessions, Dropout disables neurons by chance, which compels the network to stop relying on particular characteristics.\n\nPython model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5)) # Drops 50% of neurons during training\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep networks often benefit from higher dropout rates (0.5 or more).\n\nA lower dropout range from 0.1 to 0.3 works best for small network sizes.\n\nBatch Normalization: Improving Stability\n\nBatch Normalization standardizes different batches of network activations, resulting in stable and faster training.\n\nPython model.add(tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n\nThe specific initialization process enhances model convergence alongside the ability to use bigger Learning Rates.\n\n\n\nData Augmentation: Expanding Your Dataset\n\nThe model cannot determine meaningful patterns when operating on datasets that are too small or not adequately balanced. Artificial expansion of the dataset becomes possible through data augmentation and various transformations including:\n\nRotation\n\nFlipping\n\nScaling and zooming\n\nBrightness adjustments\n\nExample using Keras ImageDataGenerator\n\nPython from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator datagen = ImageDataGenerator( rotation_range=20, width_shift_range=0.2, height_shift_range=0.2, horizontal_flip=True, zoom_range=0.2 ) datagen.fit(x_train) # Augment training data\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technique increases both generalization capabilities and real-world resistance of cognitive systems.\n\n\n\nImproving Model Architecture\n\nUsing Deeper Networks for Better Representations\n\nDeeper models detect complex data patterns although their operation demands more processing resources and additional training information.\n\nExample: Switching from a simple dense network to a CNN for image recognition.\n\nPython model = tf.keras.Sequential([ tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)), tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2), tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'), tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2), tf.keras.layers.Flatten(), tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'), tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') ])\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Residual Connections (ResNet-Style)\n\nThe skip connection method in residual connections helps networks with numerous layers to avoid problems encountered in deep models.\n\nPython from tensorflow.keras.layers import Add, Input input_layer = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1)) conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu', padding='same')(input_layer) conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv1) residual = Add()([input_layer, conv2]) # Skip connection\n\n\n\n\n\nThe architecture prevents gradient values from becoming too small during deep model training resulting in enhanced gradient learning.\n\nLeveraging Hardware Acceleration\n\nAI models need large amounts of computational capabilities to function properly. Training processes become faster with the utilization of GPUs or TPUs hardware.\n\nChecking for GPU Availability\n\nPython import tensorflow as tf print(\"Num GPUs Available:\", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using Google Colab, enable GPU from Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU.\n\n\n\nModel Compression and Deployment Optimization\n\nThe models need to function efficiently after completing their training phase.\n\nQuantization (Reducing Model Size)\n\nThe 8-bit quantization decreases model precision from 32 bits down to enhance model speed as well as decrease its size.\n\nPython converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model) converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT] tflite_model = converter.convert()\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe process of optimizing AI models requires a combination of the following: adjusting fundamental parameters, adding regularization techniques, enhancing data quantities and designing model architectures.

The episode, available via Anfield Index, examined Bajcetic’s statistical resurgence and posed a central question: can he re-establish himself at Liverpool?\n\nDefensive Strength, But Room to Grow\n\nAfter a disrupted 2024/25 campaign – first with injury, then a failed loan at Red Bull Salzburg – Bajcetic has resurfaced at Las Palmas, where he’s now clocked approximately 1,200 minutes. The buzz has returned, largely because of two standout performances against Atletico Madrid and Getafe. But as Barter put it, “we’re talking about a player two years removed from that Real Madrid display… that’s not great for a kid in terms of development.”\n\nYet, the defensive metrics tell an encouraging story. “Tackles, 87th percentile. Interceptions, 76. Blocks, 99th. That’s the stuff we want our midfielder to do,” said Barter. Indeed, Bajcetic profiles well in duels and defensive actions, suggesting he could be moulded into a ball-winner in Liverpool’s midfield.\n\nHe’s also tall, rangy, and physically not far off Ryan Gravenberch – a potentially useful trait in Arne Slot’s system, which requires defensive robustness in the engine room.\n\nPassing Limitations and the Liverpool Standard\n\nWhere things unravel is with the ball. Bajcetic’s passing output is well below par for a Liverpool midfielder. As Barter bluntly observed: “Pass completion in the eighth percentile for a midfielder. You might say, ‘but it’s 74%’ – the standard for us is 85.”\n\nThe pass volume also lags behind. He’s averaging just under 47 passes a game, well below players in similar roles. “Compare him to someone like Endo or Gravenberch, and it’s clear – three-quarters of the wagon wheel, Grab is a better player,” Barter added.\n\nThis is crucial, because under Slot, control and build-up matter. Bajcetic’s current role at Las Palmas is predominantly defensive – “not being asked to go and do anything in the attacking box,” – which hinders any chance of showcasing progressive traits required at Anfield.\n\nMore Endo Than Gravenberch?\n\nThe clearest comparison may be to Wataru Endo. “Defensively, yes, he’s an Endo-type,” said Barter. “The problem is, we know the limitations of Endo on the ball – and Bajcetic, by the stats, is even more limited.”\n\nIf Endo is sold this summer, Bajcetic could logically fill that slot in the squad. But as Barter pointed out, “That might make business sense – but for the player? I don’t think it’s right.”\n\nThe overarching view is consistent: Bajcetic needs minutes. “He’s at a big crossroads,” Barter concluded. “Coming back to be a close-up for Liverpool? It’s not the best move. He needs to go and play.”\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThis isn’t a story of dismissal – it’s a reminder of the razor-thin margins at elite level. Stefan Bajcetic remains a highly talented, homegrown player, but development has stalled. His defensive capabilities are genuine, but Liverpool’s midfield demands more than tackling and interceptions. It requires tempo, control, and clarity in transition – areas where Bajcetic is currently behind the curve.\n\nAnother season on loan – ideally in a side with higher ball retention and a clearly defined midfield role – could be exactly what he needs to bridge the gap. Keeping him around as Endo’s understudy may serve the balance sheet, but it risks stunting a career that once promised so much.\n\nUntil he evolves into a complete midfielder, Stefan Bajcetic remains a project – not a solution."}

It’s not straightforward” on Rovella’s Transfer Risk", "fullContent": "Rovella, Zubimendi and the Weight of Premier League Expectations\n\nRovella’s Numbers Don’t Tell a Complete Story\n\nIn the most recent Transfer Market Metrics episode on Anfield Index, Dave Davis and Dr Phil Barter offer a stark, data-driven lens on Liverpool’s midfield considerations. Among the names analysed, Nicolo Rovella was put under heavy scrutiny. While his raw numbers present a tidy midfielder, Barter was quick to add nuance: “Pass completion 88th percentile and passes attempted 91st… but the only disappointing thing is not more of those are aggressive.”\n\nThat observation frames Rovella’s core issue. He is efficient but lacks penetration. In a Liverpool side under Arne Slot that values dynamism, metronomic recycling is not enough. Davis added that Rovella was “very metronomic, Zubimendi style… moves that ball very well. Not progressively though.”\n\nThe statistics reflect this. Despite being in the 91st percentile for passes attempted, he only hits the 65th percentile for progressive passes. Barter underscored that contrast: “For a guy that’s in the 91st percentile for just passes attempted to only be in the 65th percentile for progressive passes is probably quite distinct.”\n\nToo Slight for Premier League Rigours?\n\nThe physical aspect of Rovella’s game was a major concern. When comparing him directly to Liverpool’s Ryan Gravenberch, the differences were laid bare. “179 cm. Grab 190. We’re talking 11 centimetres there,” Barter noted. He then followed that up with perhaps the most damning line of all: “Grav 78 [kilograms], Rovella 68. Ten kilos at elite Premier League level is massive.”\n\nDavis echoed this sentiment, reflecting on previous cases: “Maybe there’s a Tonali shout, but maybe there’s a Kessie shout. And the physical elements… there’s real question marks there.”\n\nFor a club like Liverpool that has already faced midfield duels against powerhouses such as Newcastle and West Ham, those concerns carry weight. Barter asked rhetorically, “Have you learned nothing from a season in the Premier League?” The answer may well determine how seriously Liverpool pursue Rovella.\n\nSimilarities with Gravenberch Offer No Comfort\n\nIf Rovella is to offer competition to Gravenberch, he must offer a point of difference. Yet Barter made it clear: “Grav probably outperforms him… which, to be honest with you, is a bit of a concern because Grav is not known for his passing.”\n\nIn other words, Rovella risks being a lesser version of an already divisive figure in the Liverpool fanbase. He added: “You’d like him to be doing stuff that Grav doesn’t do… and this is a bit similar to me, but at a slightly lower level.”\n\nThat phrase—“slightly lower level”—hangs uncomfortably in the air when discussing potential signings for a club with Champions League ambitions. As Davis summarised, “It just looks like potentially Rovella has created slightly more shot-creating actions, but that isn’t necessarily something to write home about.”\n\nPremier League Transition Still Looks Unconvincing\n\nThe final nail in the coffin came when Barter compared Rovella’s transition risk to others who’ve made the same move: “The movement from Serie A to Premier League is always a bit… it’s not straightforward.”\n\nRovella, despite his statistical efficiency, appears unlikely to meet Liverpool’s tactical or physical demands. It is telling that Davis concluded the segment by describing Rovella and others as: “Three that it’s hard to see in a Liverpool shirt.”\n\nArne Slot may favour technical profiles, but physical presence, progressive passing, and adaptability remain non-negotiable in the Premier League. Rovella’s file might stay open—but for now, he looks more like a case study than a candidate."}

Unfortunately, I feel this leaves readers without crutial practical advice, which I’d like to pass on here.\n\nThis is especially true since most of the projects I’ve worked on, and developers I’ve coded with, don’t seem to know this, leading to more complex code, including values and behavior that are tightly coupled in the business concepts scattered about in separate code files.\n\nFirst, let’s review enum fundamentals:\n\nIf you’re not aware of enums, they were added to Python in version 3.4 and represent a way to communicate, among other things, a reduced set of options.\n\nFor example, you can communicate the status of tasks:\n\nfrom enum import Enum class TaskStatus(Enum): PENDING = 'pending' IN_PROGRESS = 'in_progress' COMPLETED = 'completed' CANCELLED = 'cancelled'\n\nThe four lines of code beneath the TaskStatus class definition define the enum “members,” or the specific options for this class.\n\nThis code communicates the fact that there are only four statuses a task can have.\n\nThis is very useful information, as it clearly shows the options available, but it is as deep as many developers go with enums. They don’t realize how much more enums can do besides holding constant values.\n\nFor example, many don’t know how easy it can be to select an enum member.\n\nI see a lot of code that complicates selecting enum members, like this:\n\ndef change_task_status(task_id: str, status: str): task = database.get_task_by_id(task_id) for member in TaskStatus: if member.value == status: task.status = member database.update_task(task)\n\nInstead, enum classes are smart enough to select members from their values (the things on the right side of the equal sign) You can also select members by their names (the left side of the equal sign) with square brackets, TaskStatus['PENDING'] . :\n\n>>> TaskStatus('pending') <TaskStatus.PENDING: 'pending'>\n\nThis means that you could simplify the code above like this Be aware that if the status string does not match one of the enum member’s values, it’ll raise a ValueError . :\n\ndef change_task_status(task_id: str, status: str): task = database.get_task_by_id(task_id) task.status = TaskStatus(status) database.update_task(task)\n\nBut enums are not just static values. They can have behavior and data associated with them too.\n\nThe thing about enums that many people are missing is that they are objects too.\n\nFor example, I recently worked on a project that would have had this after the TaskStatus class to connect a description to each enum member:\n\nSTATUS_TO_DESCRIPTION_MAP = { TaskStatus.PENDING: \"Task is pending\", TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS: \"Task is in progress\", TaskStatus.COMPLETED: \"Task is completed\", TaskStatus.CANCELLED: \"Task is cancelled\" }\n\nBut here’s the thing, you can add it in the enum!\n\nGranted, it takes a little bit of work, but here’s how I would do it If we weren’t using the enum’s value to select a member, we could make this simpler by editing the __init__ method instead, like they do in the docs. :\n\nclass TaskStatus(Enum): PENDING = \"pending\", 'Task is pending' IN_PROGRESS = \"in_progress\", 'Task is in progress' COMPLETED = \"completed\", 'Task is completed' CANCELLED = \"cancelled\", 'Task is cancelled' def __new__(cls, value, description): obj = object.__new__(cls) obj._value_ = value obj.description = description return obj\n\nThis means that whenever a TaskStatus member is created, it keeps its original value but also adds a new attribute, description.\n\nThis means that a TaskStatus member would behave like this:\n\n>>> completed = TaskStatus.COMPLETED >>> completed.value 'completed' >>> completed.description 'Task is completed' >>> completed.name 'COMPLETED'\n\nOn top of that, you can define methods that interact with the enum members.\n\nLet’s add what the business expects would be the next status for each member:\n\nclass TaskStatus(Enum): PENDING = \"pending\", \"Task is pending\" IN_PROGRESS = \"in_progress\", \"Task is in progress\" COMPLETED = \"completed\", \"Task is completed\" CANCELLED = \"cancelled\", \"Task is cancelled\" def __new__(cls, value, description): ... @property def expected_next_status(self): if self == TaskStatus.PENDING: return TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS elif self == TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS: return TaskStatus.COMPLETED else: # Task is completed or cancelled return self\n\nNow, each TaskStatus member “knows” what status is expected to be next:\n\n>>> TaskStatus.PENDING.expected_next_status <TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS: 'in_progress'> >>> TaskStatus.CANCELLED.expected_next_status <TaskStatus.CANCELLED: 'cancelled'>\n\nYou could use this in a task detail view:\n\ndef task_details(task_id: str): task = database.get_task_by_id(task_id) return { \"id\": task.id, \"title\": task.title, \"status\": task.status.value, \"expected_next_status\": task.status.expected_next_status.value, } >>> task_details(\"task_id_123\") { 'id': 'task_id_123', 'title': 'Sample Task', 'status': 'pending', 'expected_next_status': 'in_progress' }\n\nPython enums are more powerful than most developers realize, and I hope you might remember these great options."}

Indeed, one of the most profound illusions of our time is that the British Empire dissolved after World War II, has taken a back seat to American aggression (the British “poodle”), or even no longer exists.\n\nIn fact, Britain has taken a central role in fomenting NATO’s proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, in Israel’s genocides in the Middle East, in fostering the COVID “plandemic,” in anti-Trump “lawfare” in the U.S., and in unrest elsewhere around the world.\n\nThis happens because the British elite serve as the “tip of the spear” for the 500 year-old movement toward world conquest emanating from the globalist financial elite headquartered in the square-mile bankers’ fortress in the City of London. This is also the center of worldwide money-laundering carried out through currency exchanges and offshore banking refuges that straddle the globe.\n\nThe influence of the globalist financial elite constitutes in fact the “moneychangers in the Temple” of world civilization.\n\nPart of the mission of Three Sages in the months ahead will be to convey information about how Britain serves night and day as a home base for big global finance to ensure that such strife continues to interfere with efforts to secure the peace in the world today that we so urgently need.\n\nFollowing is an initial selection of articles:\n\nOf empires, collateral and financial fraud Key Markets report for Thursday, 17 April 2025\n\nBritain stirs the Balkans pot – again Key Markets report for Tuesday, 15 April 2025\n\nGermany wants the UK to hold its hand while it starts WWIII The chancellor-in-waiting says he would commit to giving Kiev long-range missiles if London backs him\n\nHow the British Caused the American Civil War Britain’s Scheme to Partition and Recolonize America in the 1860s\n\nStarmer/Zelensky/EU “Securing Our Future” Summit Culminates With Starmer Pledging New Billions To Ukraine And Committing To British “Boots On The Ground And Planes In The Sky”\n\n*\n\nClick the share button below to email/forward this article.

Sometimes—in strands of DNA, for example—those knots are a problem. But the ability to create knots in polymers on demand could lead to materials with bespoke properties. Simulations have now shown that a molecule comprising two different polymers joined end to end—one inert, the other self-propelling—can accumulate knots more readily than a single-component chain of the same length [1].\n\nMarin Vatin at the University of Padua in Italy and his colleagues modeled diblock (two-component) polymers as strings of beads. Each 200–400-bead chain had an adjustable ratio of active to passive beads. Both types were affected by random thermal motion. However, each active bead also propelled itself along a tangent to the chain. The vigor of this self-propulsion varied from one modeling run to the next, in all cases being much greater than the vigor of the thermal motion.\n\nThe likelihood of a diblock polymer hosting a knot at the end of a run turned out to be tiny when the polymer consisted solely of active or of passive beads. The likelihood peaked when the active length was around 40% of the total, and this peak was sharper when the self-propulsion was stronger. That behavior, the team found, arose from a competition between knot formation and dissolution. Knots tended to form in the active portion of a chain and migrated quickly along its length. Because migration slowed in the passive portion, any knot that reached this region was subsequently less likely to unravel.\n\nSo far, the researchers have studied simple knots in isolated strings. In the future, they hope to use these strings as building blocks for microknitted fabric with improved robustness and elastic properties.\n\n–Marric Stephens\n\nMarric Stephens is a Corresponding Editor for Physics Magazine based in Bristol, UK."}

It is also thought that each fish can boost its swimming efficiency by leveraging swirling patterns of water, or vortices, produced by its neighbors. Now Haibo Dong at the University of Virginia and his research group have found support for that idea by analyzing the hydrodynamics of fish moving in vertical diamond formations [1]. The results could help scientists design efficient fish-inspired robotic swarms for environmental monitoring or underwater exploration.\n\nPrevious studies on the hydrodynamics of fish schools have focused on horizontal diamond formations, where four fish are situated at the corners of a horizontally oriented diamond. Those studies suggested that such formations can increase each fish’s swimming efficiency through various vortex effects. However, in nature, fish are not restricted to moving in the same horizontal plane. For a more complete picture of schooling hydrodynamics, Dong and his group argued that vertical formations must also be considered.\n\nThe researchers performed detailed numerical simulations of the vortex dynamics in vertical diamond formations. Despite involving just four fish, these simulations were computationally costly because the vortex dynamics were highly complex. The team identified different types of hydrodynamic interactions between the fish’s bodies, fins, and wakes—the disturbances left behind by the movement of fish. Such interactions were strengthened when the fish were closely spaced and enhanced each fish’s swimming efficiency. The team says that the next step is to explore larger or more elongated diamond formations.\n\n–Ryan Wilkinson\n\nRyan Wilkinson is a Corresponding Editor for Physics Magazine based in Durham, UK."}

Kennedy Jr. Rating: About this rating Originated as Satire\n\nA rumor that users circulated online in April 2025 claimed Democrats began chugging artificial food dyes to protest policies announced by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nFor example, numerous users posting on Bluesky, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, Truth Social, X all shared the claim with no attribution to a source. Some postings displayed a photo showing Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., supposedly drinking green and pink food dyes. Others shared the photo in a meme reading, \"Democrats Chug Food Dyes to Protest RFK!\"\n\n(Searcher/Truth Social)\n\nSnopes readers asked for the truth about this claim. For example, one reader emailed, \"Did Democrats drink artificial dye in protest?\" Another asked, \"I'm doubtful, but is this true?\" A third actually attributed it to a source, writing, \"Would like a fact check on a photo and article showing Elizabeth Warren and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez drinking green and pink drinks in protest of food dye outlaw. By Babylon Bee.\"\n\nSome readers seemed to interpret the rumor as a factual recounting of real-life events. However, searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo found no reports from any credible news media outlets about Democrats drinking food dyes in protest of Kennedy's policies.\n\nRather, the rumor originated with an article (archived) published on the satirical website mentioned above, Babylon Bee. Babylon Bee's \"About\" page (archived) states, in part, \"The Babylon Bee is the world's best satire site, totally inerrant in all its truth claims. We write satire about Christian stuff, political stuff and everyday life.\"\n\nThe article began:\n\nU.S. — On the heels of news that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would be banning synthetic colors in the manufacturing of foods, Democrats across the country began chugging artificial food dyes as a bold act of protest. The civil disobedience served to underscore the displeasure of citizens on the Left for what they described as oppressive fascism that would deprive them of their right to develop severe hormonal, autoimmune, and reproductive side effects, as well as put themselves at increased risk for various cancers.\n\nBabylon Bee and Trump's Bee tweet\n\n\"People believe it, sometimes. They can't tell if it's real,\" Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon said of the website's content during an October 2023 video interview (21:57) with X owner and tech billionaire Elon Musk. \"I can't blame them. I can never blame them.\"\n\nMusk responded, \"Some of these articles are, I can't tell, I mean I can tell that it doesn't have a Bee logo on it, but the actual text of the headline is indistinguishable from a Babylon Bee piece.\"\n\nDillon continued, \"Yeah, that's why I don't blame people when someone says that they, you know, they make fun of people who think that satire is true. I'm like, I don't, you know, it's … the real headlines are so satirical in nature. They seem like a parody, so. If you believe a Bee article, it's just … and naturally it's gonna happen.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump himself once tweeted (archived) a Babylon Bee story about Twitter supposedly shutting down entirely to suppress the spread of negative news regarding then-President Joe Biden. At the time of Trump's tweet in October 2020, USA Today reported that Trump appeared to share the satirical story \"in earnest.\"\n\nFor further reading, a previous fact check examined the rumor claiming Kennedy announced he would ban artificial dyes from all American food products, effectively immediately.\n\nFor background, here is why we alert readers to rumors created by sources calling their output humorous or satirical."}

It’s a really cool, lightweight laptop with battery life for days, literally. But it has one design problem that I see all too often on otherwise good laptops: The USB-C ports are only on one side.\n\nThis sucks. Allow me to use several hundred words to explain why.\n\nThere are a lot of great things about USB-C. Access to incredibly fast data transfers. Video capabilities on a (somewhat) universal standard. But the greatest for me, by a wide margin, is that you can use it to charge up almost any device with the same cable. I want every single device that I own with a battery to allow charging via a USB-C port.\n\nAnd we’re almost there. My phone, my tablet, my laptop, my headphones, even my portable batteries that I use to charge all of them on the go, each one uses USB-C. All of this is good. But for most of the time, a phone, a tablet, headphones, et cetera only need one USB-C port. That’s all that’s practical for these devices.\n\nA laptop needs multiple USB-C ports. At least two, if only so you can charge it up and use one extra device like a flash drive without needing to bring along a dongle. And at least one of those should be on both sides of the laptop.\n\nFlexible charging is important\n\nIn my case, this is specifically so that you can charge it up from the left or the right. And it’s important for laptops in particular, because laptops are mobile devices, and mobile devices that are bigger and bulkier than phones and tablets.\n\nMy ThinkPad X1 Nano, pictured above, was considered pretty premium when it came out three years ago. It’s super lightweight and designed for business travel. And yet both of its USB-C ports — its only ports — are on the left side. Extremely frustrating!\n\nWhen you’re on the go and you need a charge, you can’t always find an ideal spot for it. Maybe you’re in a cafe and the charger is on one side of the table against the wall. Or in a hotel where it’s only on one side of the bed. A bus where the outlet beneath your seat is busted and you have to ask your fellow passenger if you can politely invade their space. (Fix your busses, Martz, the Wi-Fi hasn’t worked in years.)\n\nThe point is that if you can only charge on one side of your laptop, you’re going to be put in an awkward position up to half of the time. You can twist yourself into an uncomfortable pretzel, or just get a super-long charging cable and carry it with you. And I’ll point out that both of those were solutions from the Before Times, when every brand had its own barrel port or proprietary charger.\n\nBut you shouldn’t have to — laptops should be designed with this basic use case in mind. Some are, but many aren’t, even “premium” designs like that aforementioned Zenbook A14, which only features a lonely little USB-A port on the right (which can’t charge up the device).\n\nEven Apple, a company that proclaims its meticulous design process in its advertising, has USB-C ports on only one side of the MacBook Air. If you want the basic creature comfort of charging on either side, you have to step up to the MacBook Pro.\n\nFoundry\n\nHere’s what really steams me. When I’m travelling I often carry a USB-C monitor, specifically a ThinkVision M14. This is made by Lenovo, the same company that made my laptop. And it has USB-C ports on both sides, specifically to make it easier to charge, both for itself and its pass-through laptop charging feature.\n\nWhy are laptops like this?\n\nI’ve spoken about this little pet peeve with many of my fellow tech writers, and plenty of regular laptop users too. I’ve never met one who didn’t agree with my viewpoint. So I’m absolutely certain that laptop makers are aware of our desires here. In fact, I know it: I spoke to a former tech writer person I’d worked with, who now works for a PC manufacturer and asked them if they’d raised the point with their new employer.\n\nThey said that yes, they had in fact spoken with the engineering teams that decide where to put laptop ports and told them that people want USB-C charging on both sides. The engineers responded that it added expense to the design, so it doesn’t make it into some models.\n\nMattias Inghe\n\nI’m sure that’s true. My own knowledge of the ins and outs of electronics design is just enough that I don’t doubt it. A modern USB-C port is complicated — it needs extra design work and electronics elements for battery charging, for video output, for standards like Thunderbolt and the fastest data. Every small adjustment, every tiny decision made in the design process has a cost that affects the final manufacturing and, thus the eventual retail price of a product.\n\nBut I reject this as a definitive reason to make this choice. You can say the same thing about tons of other elements of laptop design — say, using a trackpad that supports multi-touch gestures or a keyboard that has LED backlighting. Asus told me it spent a huge amount of time and resources engineering the hinge on the Zenbook A14, to make sure it can easily open with just one finger. And the presenter was immensely proud of the “Ceraluminum” coating on the entire laptop — as they should be, it’s really nice!\n\nNone of these elements are strictly necessary. You can operate a laptop without them. But all of them add to the overall experience of a product. Little things that we as end users barely think about, sometimes don’t even notice, can have a huge impact on our final impression of a device.\n\nIt’s worth the extra work\n\nHowever much extra it might cost to get a USB-C port on both sides of a laptop, it’s worth it. Again, that’s according to me, every other tech writer who reviews laptops, and everyone else they’ve spoken to on the subject. Note that both the Framework Laptop and Intel’s new modular guidelines allow for full-power USB-C on both sides of the laptop, and these devices are made for sustainability with far more engineering necessary than a permanently soldered port.\n\nAnd while I don’t have a component breakdown to make my case, I’m pretty darn confident that it’s not an unattainable design goal for laptops, especially once you get out of the budget category. Allow me to illustrate.\n\nThis is a Lenovo Legion Go. It costs $700. It has a USB-C port on the top and on the bottom.\n\nMattias Inghe\n\nThis is the Asus ROG Gaming Phone. It costs $849. It has two USB-C ports, one on the side and one on the bottom, and I’m pretty sure it takes a lot more engineering work to fit two ports on a phone than on a laptop.\n\nThis is the Nintendo Switch 2. I don’t know how much it costs yet, but given Nintendo’s mass-market savvy and the price of the original, I’d be flabbergasted if it’ll launch at anything north of $500. It has USB-C ports on the top and bottom.\n\nNintendo\n\nThis is the Lenovo Chromebook Duet, a small, cheap, ChromeOS-powered tablet, topping out at $399 for the most expensive model. How many USB-C ports does it have? I’ll give you three guesses, but you’ll only need one, because it’s two. Two USB-C ports, on two different sides. And again, this is the same company that made my laptop in the header image, equipping a cheaper device with this handy design feature.\n\nMichael Crider/IDG\n\nI think I’ve made my point. If all of these devices can fit a secondary USB-C charging port, into both their design and their budget, there’s no reason that manufacturers can’t do this for every laptop with USB-C capability. And they absolutely should."}

As reported by Fabrizio Romano, the Reds are among the clubs showing “genuine interest” in the Bournemouth centre-back, whose performances this season have catapulted him into elite-level discussions.\n\nBournemouth secured Huijsen for just £12.8 million from Juventus last summer—a deal that now looks like one of the bargains of the decade. Under the guidance of Andoni Iraola, Huijsen has played a pivotal role in guiding the Cherries to a record Premier League points tally, while also earning senior international caps for Spain.\n\nWith a £50 million release clause in his current deal, Europe’s heavyweights are circling. Romano noted:\n\n“Liverpool interest is really genuine, they want him for sure but this is not new.”\n\nThat statement alone reveals a long-term admiration from the Anfield recruitment team. As the club prepares for life under Arne Slot, landing a young defender with Huijsen’s attributes would align perfectly with Liverpool’s ongoing transition.\n\nChelsea’s Aggressive Approach and Arsenal’s Quiet Pressure\n\nRomano also highlighted Chelsea’s aggressive intent in this market. Their approach remains consistent with recent strategies, offering long-term deals to promising youngsters.\n\n“Chelsea were already open to sending a proposal in January already, but was impossible because the clause was not valid [in winter window].”\n\nIt’s clear the Blues are ready to invest heavily again, reportedly preparing a seven-year deal to lure Huijsen to Stamford Bridge. However, Chelsea’s ambitious moves haven’t yet convinced the player.\n\nArsenal, too, remain in contention, with Mikel Arteta seeking a top-tier centre-back to bolster his title-challenging squad. Romano confirmed:\n\n“Don’t forget about Arsenal, they are there and are pushing.”\n\nThis three-way Premier League race—Liverpool, Chelsea, and Arsenal—underscores just how highly Huijsen is rated across the top of English football.\n\nMarket Dynamics Could Rule Others Out\n\nWhile other clubs, including Newcastle United, Tottenham, and Bayern Munich, have shown interest, Romano believes they may struggle to keep up financially or logistically.\n\n“It looks difficult for Newcastle United and Tottenham to enter this race in a concrete way… Bayern feel that Premier League clubs can spend way more.”\n\nThis further narrows the field, suggesting a genuine three-horse race for the Spanish defender. Importantly, Huijsen himself has not made a final decision, and discussions with interested clubs are ongoing.\n\n“The reality is Dean Huijsen has not made a decision yet. He is speaking to all these clubs… so Bournemouth are not involved.”\n\nWhy Huijsen Would Fit at Anfield\n\nLiverpool’s need for defensive depth is no secret. Virgil van Dijk, although still world-class, isn’t getting younger. Ibrahima Konaté has had persistent fitness issues, and while Jarell Quansah has emerged as a surprise package, he remains in the early stages of his development.\n\nHuijsen, with his composure on the ball, intelligent positioning, and elite reading of the game, would provide Arne Slot with a long-term solution. His tactical versatility and experience playing in both Italy and the Premier League make him an ideal modern defender for a high-line system.\n\nWith Romano confirming that “Liverpool will be there,” the onus may now be on Liverpool to move quickly and decisively before Chelsea or Arsenal win the race.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool fans, this pursuit signals a welcome return to forward-thinking recruitment. Dean Huijsen isn’t just a promising young defender—he’s a player tailor-made for the kind of football Arne Slot is expected to implement. Calm under pressure, technically gifted, and tactically mature well beyond his years, he could easily become a cornerstone of Liverpool’s backline for a decade.\n\nSupporters will appreciate that this isn’t a reactive move. The fact Liverpool’s interest was already genuine as far back as January, as Fabrizio Romano notes, shows that the club’s scouting department is operating proactively rather than chasing headlines.\n\nYes, £50 million is a significant investment, but in the current market, it’s a price tag that reflects Huijsen’s potential. Given Liverpool’s historical success with calculated, data-led transfers—see Diogo Jota, Luis Díaz, and Dominik Szoboszlai—it’s easy to trust the process.\n\nIn short: if the Reds land Huijsen, it won’t just be a signing for now—it’ll be a statement for the future."}

Sign up for a free account or log in.\n\nAI tools overhype research findings far more often than humans, with a study suggesting the newest bots are the worst offenders—particularly when they are specifically instructed not to exaggerate.\n\nDutch and British researchers have found that AI summaries of scientific papers are much more likely than the original authors or expert reviewers to “overgeneralize” the results.\n\nTimes Higher Education\n\nThe analysis, reported in the journal Royal Society Open Science, suggests that AI summaries—purportedly designed to help spread scientific knowledge by rephrasing it in “easily understandable language”—tend to ignore “uncertainties, limitations and nuances” in the research by “omitting qualifiers” and “oversimplifying” the text.\n\nThis is particularly “risky” when applied to medical research, the report warns. “If chatbots produce summaries that overlook qualifiers [about] the generalizability of clinical trial results, practitioners who rely on these chatbots may prescribe unsafe or inappropriate treatments.”\n\nThe team analyzed almost 5,000 AI summaries of 200 journal abstracts and 100 full articles. Topics ranged from caffeine’s influence on irregular heartbeats and the benefits of bariatric surgery in reducing cancer risk to the impacts of disinformation and government communications on residents’ behavior and people’s beliefs about climate change.\n\nSummaries produced by older AI apps—such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta’s Llama 2, both released in 2023—proved about 2.6 times as likely as the original abstracts to contain generalized conclusions.\n\nThe likelihood of generalization increased to nine times in summaries by ChatGPT−4o, which was released last May, and 39 times in synopses by Llama 3.3, which emerged in December.\n\nInstructions to “stay faithful to the source material” and “not introduce any inaccuracies” produced the opposite effect, with the summaries proving about twice as likely to contain generalized conclusions as those generated when bots were simply asked to “provide a summary of the main findings.”\n\nThis suggested that generative AI may be vulnerable to “ironic rebound” effects, where instructions not to think about something—for example, “a pink elephant”—automatically elicited images of the banned subject.\n\nAI apps also appeared prone to failings like “catastrophic forgetting,” where new information dislodged previously acquired knowledge or skills, and “unwarranted confidence,” where “fluency” took precedence over “caution and precision.”\n\nFine-tuning the bots can exacerbate these problems, the authors speculate. When AI apps are “optimized for helpfulness,” they become less inclined to “express uncertainty about questions beyond their parametric knowledge.” A tool that “provides a highly precise but complex answer … may receive lower ratings from human evaluators,” the paper explains.\n\nOne summary cited in the paper reinterpreted a finding that a diabetes drug was “better than placebo” as an endorsement of the “effective and safe treatment” option. “Such … generic generalizations could mislead practitioners into using unsafe interventions,” the paper says.\n\nIt offers five strategies to “mitigate the risks” of overgeneralizations in AI summaries. They include using AI firm Anthropic’s Claude family of bots, which were found to produce the “most faithful” summaries.\n\nAnother recommendation is to lower the bot’s “temperature” setting. Temperature is an adjustable parameter that controls the randomness of the generated text.\n\nUwe Peters, an assistant professor in theoretical philosophy at Utrecht University and the co-author of the report, said the overgeneralizations “occurred frequently and systematically.”\n\nHe said the findings meant there was a risk that even subtle changes to the findings by the AI could “mislead users and amplify misinformation, especially when the outputs appear polished and trustworthy.”\n\nTech companies should evaluate their models for such tendencies, he added, and share these openly. For universities, it showed an “urgent need for stronger AI literacy” among staff and students."}
