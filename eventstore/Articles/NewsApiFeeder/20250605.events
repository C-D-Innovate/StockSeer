(Photo by Jakub ... More Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is really leaning into AI, recently announcing a massive $10 billion investment in new data centers in North Carolina. Like Google and Microsoft, Amazon has been a major player in the AI boom, spending a whopping $222 billion on capital expenditures since 2022.\nThe stock has seen a nice jump lately, climbing 24% from around $167 on April 21 to $208 now. This rally seems to be fueled by the broader market\ufffds positive reaction to new trade deals and a pause on reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China. The probability of the U.S. economy going into a recession this year has also come down from 60% earlier to 40% now, according to J.P. Morgan Research.\nGiven the change in overall market sentiment, you might be wondering if Amazon is still a smart investment after its recent climb. We believe it is. Even with the recent rally, Amazon shows strong operational growth and solid financial health, and its stock isn't overpriced.\nOur analysis dives deep into Amazon\ufffds investment potential by looking at its current valuation compared to its recent operating performance and overall financial health. We\ufffdve assessed Amazon across key areas like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience. Our findings show that Amazon has a strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see \ufffd RGTI Stock: What\ufffds Next After An 1,100% Rally?\nWhen we look at AMZN stock against the broader market, it seems pretty reasonable. Amazon\ufffds price-to-sales ratio is 3.4 times, which is pretty close to the S&P 500\ufffds 3.0 times. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.3 times is higher than the market\ufffds 26.4 times, but its price-to-free cash flow ratio is 19.3 times, which is slightly better than the S&P 500\ufffds 20.5 times. This means Amazon is doing a good job generating cash compared to its price. Check out our dashboard on Amazon\ufffds Valuation Ratios for more details.\nThis moderate valuation suggests that Amazon isn't really getting a premium for its growth potential right now. It's likely that those high capital expenditures we mentioned earlier have made some investors a bit nervous.\nWhile that higher P/E ratio signals that the market expects Amazon's earnings to keep growing, it also means the stock could be vulnerable if that growth slows down. However, it's worth noting that this 33x P/E is actually lower than Amazon's average P/E of 46x over the past two years.\nAmazon\ufffds revenue just keeps climbing, showing how good they are at expanding across all their different businesses. Over the last three years, their annual revenue has grown by an average of 11%, much better than the S&P 500\ufffds 5.5%. This strong performance continued in the past year, with revenues jumping 10.1% from $591 billion to $650 billion.\nLooking at their most recent quarterly results, things are still looking good. Revenues grew 8.6% to $156 billion compared to $143 billion in the same period last year. This consistent growth, whether we're looking at annual or quarterly numbers, really highlights how Amazon's diverse business model keeps them expanding, even as they get bigger and bigger.\nWhile Amazon\ufffds revenues are trending higher, its profitability tells a slightly different story, and it might explain why some investors are a bit hesitant. For instance, their operating margin is 11.0%, which is a bit lower than the S&P 500's average of 13.2%. This suggests they're facing some challenges in turning all that revenue into efficient operations. Similarly, Amazon's net income margin of 10.1% also lags behind the broader market's 11.6% average.\nHowever, Amazon\ufffds operating cash flow margin is 17.5%, actually beating the S&P 500\ufffds 14.9%. This means they\ufffdre doing a great job at generating cash, even if their accounting profits seem lower. This difference often comes down to Amazon\ufffds huge investments in growth and infrastructure. These investments might hit the company\ufffds short-term profit margins, but they\ufffdre setting it up for bigger growth down the road.\nAmazon\ufffds balance sheet is incredibly strong, giving them a really solid base to handle any economic bumps in the road. The company\ufffds debt-to-equity ratio is super low at just 6.1%, which is way better than the S&P 500\ufffds average of 19.9%. This conservative approach means Amazon has tons of financial wiggle room for big investments.\nThey\ufffdre also sitting on a good amount of cash. Cash and cash equivalents make up 14.7% of their total assets, slightly more than the broader market\ufffds 13.8%. With $95 billion in cash and $643 billion in total assets, Amazon has serious resources to chase new growth opportunities and ride out any tough times.\nLooking back at how Amazon's stock performed during past market downturns gives us some good insights. It shows they can be pretty resilient, but also quite volatile.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Amazon actually held up pretty well. Their stock only dropped 22.7% compared to the S&P 500's 33.9% plunge, and it bounced back to pre-crisis levels in just two months.\nHowever, things were a bit different during the 2022 inflation shock. Amazon's stock took a bigger hit, falling 56.1% while the market dropped 25.4%. It took almost two years for the stock to fully recover, which just goes to show how growth stocks can feel more pain when interest rates go up and valuations get squeezed.\nThe 2008 financial crisis presented similar challenges, with Amazon declining 65.3% against the market's 56.8% drop, though it also recovered within two years. These patterns suggest that while Amazon tends to swing more during severe market stress, it typically has the underlying strength to bounce back over time.\nWe believe Amazon is an attractive investment right now. It offers a good valuation combined with incredibly strong fundamentals and a solid financial position.\nThe company is delivering double-digit revenue growth and boasts a fortress-like balance sheet. These strengths outweigh any minor concerns about profitability. Notably, Amazon\ufffds AWS segment is far more profitable, boasting estimated EBITDA margins of around 45% last year, than its other businesses, which have EBITDA margins under 15%. With AWS's contribution to the company's overall sales on the rise\ufffdup from 12% in 2021 to 17% last year\ufffdthe overall profitability will also improve.\nFurthermore, with a proven ability to recover from downturns, Amazon provides an excellent entry point into the long-term growth trends of the ongoing AI boom. It\ufffds a strong addition for growth-oriented portfolios. However, it\ufffds important to consider the potential risks. Amazon\ufffds growth could slow down, and it might underperform during times of economic uncertainty. There\ufffds also the question of whether its significant investments in AI will pay off. You should definitely weigh these risks.\nNot too happy about the volatile nature of AMZN stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."}

They have discovered they no longer need armies of new hires to grow\ufffdextremely bullish news for shareholders because human employees are expensive.\nGood ones can also be notoriously elusive. For example, I\ufffdm the longest-standing member of my kids\ufffd school marketing committee, and we\ufffdre always scrambling for volunteers (what non-profit isn\ufffdt?).\nUntil now, that is.\nOver the weekend, we welcomed the most talented marketer I\ufffdve ever worked with to our team: ChatGPT 4.5. \ufffdGPT\ufffd graciously accepted our volunteer position, and we\ufffdre already actively boosting online referrals for the school. I\ufffdm learning cutting-edge \ufffdAI referral\ufffd techniques straight from the entity that invented them.\nIt was the easiest recruitment effort I\ufffdve ever experienced. GPT and I were already collaborating closely to market and sell several software products, so extending our teamwork to the non-profit world was seamless.\nThe same dynamic is quietly playing out at for\ufffdprofit companies, particularly the tech giants that dominate the cap-weighted S&P 500. A senior executive friend at Meta (META) recently confirmed to me that the company has essentially frozen hiring, pivoting entirely toward AI-driven growth.\nIt already shows in the numbers. Over the past year Meta has increased revenues by 22% while only hiring 10% more people. Sales are growing faster than humans, a trend that I expect to accelerate in the months and years ahead.\nIn fact, I wouldn\ufffdt be surprised if Meta has already reached peak headcount\ufffdwhich means profits are set to surge even more.\nAnd Meta isn\ufffdt alone in this \ufffdgrowing without hiring\ufffd trend.\nAlphabet (GOOG) grew revenues by 14% without any net new hires. And Nvidia (NVDA) did grow headcount by 13%, but for good reason\ufffdsales exploded by 126%! Microsoft (MSFT) is likewise sailing along without the need for new engineers, with 16% revenue growth on just a 3% headcount increase:\nTech Growth\nThe AI adoption at these companies is just beginning. These profit machines are already selling $1 to $2 million in product per employee, but their profits are going to pop as they sell even more without the expense drag of adding new employees!\nThis four-pack packs 20% of the S&P 500 index. When we combine Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), Netflix (NFLX) and Apple (AAPL)\ufffdfour more tech companies that are scaling without hiring\ufffdwe have 32% of the index.\nEarlier in the year, I warned that the \ufffdtech heaviness\ufffd of the S&P 500 was dangerous\ufffdand it sure was during the tariff troubles of March and April. But with trade tensions fading and tech profits exploding thanks to lean payrolls, these big 8 companies are now set to power the index higher.\nPlus, we have a weakening US dollar. Stocks are, of course, priced in dollars. So, a softer dollar is another bullish catalyst for the S&P 500.\nAs income investors, we can tap this rising tide for steady income. To do so, we\ufffdll use covered calls\ufffda strategy where we buy stocks and then sell (\ufffdwrite\ufffd) call options to other investors. We earn income now from the option premiums we collect, paid upfront to agree to sell our shares at a higher price later.\nMarket volatility from a tumultuous spring means these options pay generous premiums right now (covered call options pay more when things are bouncing around!). So, this is a good market moment to cash in on leftover fear. I\ufffdm talking about dividends up to 9.7% that will benefit from the S&P 500 soaring towards 9000. (Yes, it sounds wild\ufffdbut with record profits plus a declining dollar, this is a potential price target before the end of Trump 2.0.)\nEaton Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversified Equity Income Fund (EXG) yields 9.2% and trades at a 6% discount. That\ufffds a sweet deal because it holds big winners like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, then boosts income by selling covered calls on the S&P 500 and international indices.\nThe income from these constantly expiring calls is the key to the EXG\ufffds sky-high \ufffdsynthetic yield.\ufffd The fund collects premiums from option buyers immediately after it writes these calls, generating steady income for shareholders.\nWe can think of this as \ufffdrenting\ufffd out positions to generate extra cash. EXG owns the underlying shares behind the S&P 500. Each month it leases its collection of stocks and collects the option premiums. Rinse and repeat.\nNuveen S&P 500 Buy-Write Income Fund (BXMX) pays 8.1% and trades at a 9% discount to its net asset value (NAV)\ufffdanother good deal because we\ufffdre talking Apple and Amazon for 91 cents on the dollar.\nFinally the Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD) dishes a 9.7% dividend.

More Pennsylvania, U.S., on Monday, Nov. 9, 2015. Freshpet produces the only industrial refrigerated pet food on the market, which is made with only fresh ingredients and eschews preservatives. Sales of premium dog food have surged 45 percent to $10.5 billion in the U.S. since 2009 and now account for more than half of the market. Photographer: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg\nI originally put Freshpet Inc. (FRPT) in the Danger Zone on February 2, 2022 and most recently reiterated my bearish opinion on the stock in October 17, 2022.\nDespite falling 45% YTD, I\ufffdm here to remind you: this stock remains dangerous.\nFigure 1: Freshpet Outperformance as a Short From 2/3/22 Through 5/9/25\nFRPT Performance as Danger Zone Pick\nFreshpet has successfully grown its retail presence and increased its total store count (stores that sell Freshpet products) by 380 from the end of 4Q24 to the end of 1Q25. Similarly, the company\ufffds revenue increased 18% YoY in 1Q25, mainly driven by volume gains of 15% and favorable price/mix of 3%.\nAdditionally, Freshpet\ufffds adjusted EBITDA increased from $31 million in 1Q24 to $36 million in 1Q25, though I show below why this metric is misleading.\nRetail improvements and top-line growth aside, Freshpet\ufffds fundamentals remain in very poor shape. The company missed earnings estimates in its 1Q25 report and lowered full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to the range of $190-$210 million, compared to prior guidance of \ufffdat least $210 million\ufffd.\nFreshpet\ufffds management provides a misleading view of the company\ufffds profitability when it directs investors to its \ufffdAdjusted\ufffd EBITDA. From 2019 to the TTM, Freshpet\ufffds Adjusted EBITDA improved from $29 million to $167 million, while its GAAP net income rose from -$1 million to $16 million.\nOver the same time, the company\ufffds economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, fell from -$11 million to -$88 million. It is a big red flag when the company\ufffds preferred non-GAAP metric is rising while its economic earnings are declining, or even worse, when its GAAP net income gets outpaced as well.\nThe discrepancy between the metrics comes largely from the company removing $8.8 million in non-cash share-based compensation when calculating 1Q25 adjusted EBITDA. For reference, Freshpet\ufffds 1Q25 GAAP net income was -$13 million. The discrepancy should come as no surprise as Freshpet openly admits in earnings releases that \ufffdthe non-GAAP measures are not and should not be considered an alternative to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures\ufffd.\nFigure 2: Freshpet\ufffds Adjusted EBITDA vs. Net Income vs. Economic Earnings: 2019 \ufffd TTM\nFRPT Misleading Earnings 2019-TTM\nFreshpet\ufffds total operating expenses, which include cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses have remained high for years. For instance, over the last five years, total operating expenses averaged 106% of revenue.\nMore recently, Freshpet\ufffds total operating expenses rose from 96% of revenue in 1Q24 to 104% of revenue in 1Q25. The increase was driven by SG&A expenses rising from 36% of revenue to 44% of revenue over the same time.\nConsidering the company\ufffds high operating costs, it should come as no surprise that Freshpet has been and continues to burn cash.\nFreshpet\ufffds free cash flow (FCF) has been negative on an annual basis every year in my model (dating back to 2017). On a quarterly basis, Freshpet\ufffds FCF has been negative in 34 of the 36 quarters in my model. The only two quarters with positive FCF occurred in 4Q16 and 2Q18.\nFrom 2019 through 1Q25, Freshpet has burned through a cumulative $1.2 billion (29% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. See Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Freshpet\ufffds Cumulative Free Cash Flow Since 2019\nFRPT FCF Burn 2019-1Q25\nDespite its cash burn rate, I did not make Freshpet a Zombie Stock because its cash on hand can support its TTM cash burn rate for 34 months (more than the 24 months cut off) from the end of May 2025.\nNote that Freshpet was a Zombie Stock before Jana Partners, in 4Q22, took a 10% stake in Freshpet and boosted the company\ufffds cash on hand enough to extend its cash burn runway past 24 months. Jana Partners exited its position in Fresphet in 2Q24. Consequently, FRPT is at risk of going back on the Zombie Stock list should its cash burn runway fall below 24 months.\nFreshpet faces direct competition from both larger companies like Nestle (NSRGY), Mars Inc., General Mills (GIS), Colgate-Palmolive (CL), and Chewy (CHWY), as well as smaller, lesser-known start-ups. Additionally, the company faces heavy competition from private label pet food brands.\nIn the most recently available comparable public data (Mars is privately owned and doesn\ufffdt disclose pet business sales every year), the pet food market was dominated by Nestle and Mars. In 2023, Nestle (32%) and Mars (29%) combined to make up 61% of the global pet food market. Hill\ufffds Pet Nutrition (owned by Colgate-Palmolive) General Mills (GIS), The J.M. Smucker Company (SJM), rounded out the top five. Freshpet held just over 1% market share. See Figure 4.\nFigure 4: Freshpet\ufffds Market Share Compared to Peers\nFRPT Market Share 2023\nImportantly, these companies have significant competitive advantages in the form of larger manufacturing scale, a more extensive distribution network, and other business lines that generate cash to re-invest in the business.\nIf I analyze estimated market share based on Freshpet\ufffds 2024 sales and the estimated pet food market size in 2024, I find that the company holds just 1% of the estimated market.\nCompetitors also include general retailers, such as Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), and Amazon (AMZN), each of which sell their own private label pet brands.\nFreshpet not only lags the competition in market share, but also in profitability.\nEven though Freshpet achieved a record net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) of $50 million in 2024, profits have fallen to -$10 million in 1Q25, down from $9 million in 1Q24. Similarly, the company\ufffds return on invested capital (ROIC) hit a peak of 4% in 2024, but has fallen to 2% in the TTM ending 1Q25.\nPer Figure 5, Freshpet has the lowest ROIC and one of the lowest NOPAT margins in the industry.\nFigure 5: Freshpet\ufffds Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM\nFRPT Profitability vs. Peers\nTaking market share in an industry already dominated by larger and more profitable companies will be hard to do, especially considering that Freshpet\ufffds revenue is entirely undiversified or 100% dependent on its pet food sales.\nBelow, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into Freshpet\ufffds stock price. Freshpet\ufffds stock is priced as if it will grow profits at accelerated rates while also taking huge chunks of market share. I also present additional DCF scenarios to highlight the downside risk in the stock if Freshpet fails to achieve these overly optimistic expectations.\nTo justify its current price of ~$80/share, my model shows Freshpet would have to:\nIn this scenario, Freshpet would generate $11.7 billion in sales in 2034, which is 12x its TTM sales, 3x Colgate-Palmolive\ufffds TTM pet food sales, and 5x General Mill\ufffds pet food sales.\nThis scenario also implies Freshpet\ufffds NOPAT would reach $608 million in 2034, compared to the company\ufffds all-time high NOPAT of $50 million and TTM NOPAT of $30 million.\nThe implied sales in this scenario equate to 7% of the forecasted global pet food market in 2034, which is far above the company\ufffds estimated 1% market share in 2024.\nFurthermore, companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are \ufffdunbelievably rare\ufffd, making the expectations in Freshpet\ufffds share price even more unrealistic.\nIf we, instead, assume Freshpet:\nthe stock would be worth $49/share today \ufffd a 40% downside to the current price.\nIn this scenario, Freshpet would grow sales to $7.2 billion in 2034, which would be around 8x the company\ufffds TTM sales, 2x Colgate-Palmolive\ufffds TTM pet food sales, and 3x General Mill\ufffds pet food sales.\nThe implied sales in this second scenario would represent 4% of the pet foods market in 2034, which is 4x the company\ufffds market share in 2024.\nIf I instead assume Freshpet:\nthe stock would be worth just $26/share today \ufffd a 68% downside to the current price.\nThe implied sales in this scenario would still represent 3% of the projected global pet foods market in 2034.\nFigure 6 compares Freshpet\ufffds implied future revenue in these scenarios to its historical revenue. For comparison, I include the TTM pet food sales of peers Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and General Mills (GIS).\nFigure 6: Freshpet\ufffds Historical and Implied Revenue: DCF Valuation Scenarios\nFRPT DCF Implied NOPAT Scenarios\nEach of the above scenarios assumes Freshpet grows revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that highlight the unrealistically high expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Freshpet\ufffds invested capital grew 43% compounded annually from 2019 through the TTM. If I assume Freshpet\ufffds invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger.\nGiven that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if Freshpet is worth buying at any price. The answer is likely no.\nThe company has $477 million in total debt, $42 million in outstanding employee stock options, and just $226 million excess cash. Freshpet has an economic book value, or no-growth value, of <$1/share. In other words, I do not think equity investors will ever see anywhere close to the level of economic earnings required to justify anything more than $1/share under normal operations."}
