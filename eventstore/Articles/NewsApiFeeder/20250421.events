Conversations reported in the business press describe situations where brands debate their ability to raise prices without lowering demand. Dynamic pricing is once again a consideration across brands aiming to implement what airlines and hotels implement. There is a raft of articles on what brand owners may or may not do to stay viable: raise prices, maintain prices, eat the costs, vary the costs across daypart, type of customer.\n\nAt the heart of the conversation is the fact that brand value is customer-perceived. Brands set prices. However, customers determine the value of brands at the set prices. Customer-perceived brand value relies on the delivery of the total brand experience (functional, emotional, social benefits) relative to the total brand cost (money, time, effort) multiplied by trust. You cannot compete on price alone. Price is not value. Price is a component of “total brand cost.” To win, a brand must be aware of what the brand stands for, the level of trust people imbue in the brand, and the costs relative to the experience received. When you deal with price alone, you are creating a commodity, attracting customers who are indifferent to brand and willing to consider any brand as long as it is a low price.\n\nThis article is part of Branding Strategy Insider’s newsletter. You can sign up here to get thought pieces like this sent to your inbox.\n\nIf you read the Op Ed in the Wall Street Journal by George Gilder and Gale Pooley, you will understand that time is as (or more) precious than money. Time is a significant contributor to a brand’s cost. By focusing on money alone, a brand is doing itself an immense disservice. Time, effort, and money are the costs by which a customer or potential customer develops a brand’s relative, perceived value.\n\nContinuing to believe that brand and brand management are all about image, communications, advertising, and apps is also major mismarketing. Please note: customer-perceived brand value affects share price.\n\nFor example, there was NUMMI. NUMMI was a joint manufacturing venture between General Motors and Toyota. Opened in 1984, NUMMI built Toyota Corollas and General Motors built Prizms as well as Chevy Geos and Novas. From an operational standpoint, there was a lot of positive learning. From a brand standpoint, the news was a disaster for GM. The Toyota Corollas and the Chevrolet Prizms were built side by side. Toyota designed both models and the differences in their components and trim were minor. Both vehicles received high marks from Consumer Reports. But, the GM-branded Prizm required significantly more in buyer incentives to support its sales.\n\nThe suggested retail price for the Toyota Corolla was $15,223. The suggested retail price for the Chevy Prizm was $16, 315. The net price for the Toyota Corolla was $14,973. The net price for the Chevy Prizm was $14,315. The net price difference was $658. The trade-in price for the Toyota Corolla was $11,417 while the trade-in price for the Chevy Prizm was $9,955. The difference was $1,482. Toyota sold 230,000 Corollas. Chevy sold 52,000 Prizms.\n\nThe profit differential, as reported in 1988 by The Journal of Brand Management, was: Toyota made $108M more than GM in operating profits, while Toyota dealers made $128M more than GM dealers\n\nNissan had a similar experience. In an interview with Bloomberg BusinessWeek immediately after his arrival at Nissan, Carlos Ghosn said that fixing the quality of Nissan vehicles was an imperative. And, incentives would need to be lowered or eliminated because the cost of incentives was a serious financial drag on profits. What did Mr. Ghosn learn? Nissan research showed that Nissans were at a significant price-value disadvantage relative to Toyota. The Nissan research used two identical Nissan vehicles. One Nissan vehicle carried a Toyota badge; the other vehicle kept its Nissan badge. Results indicated that customers would need at least $1000 in incentives to purchase the Nissan-badged vehicle instead of the Toyota-branded vehicle.\n\nBrand has a huge effect on brand value. Brand is a financial asset affecting the bottom line.\n\nLet’s return to price. Price is an important cost in the customer’s value equation. And, cost is one thing that marketers actually control.\n\nIn 1976, a Dutch economist, Peter van Westendorp developed a market research technique for determining customer price preferences. It was called PSM or Price Sensitivity Meter. Van Westendorp understood that people are quite able to intuit a price-value relationship. People inherently have an understanding of “pricing thresholds” whereby they perceive a price as too high, too low, high but acceptable and so forth.\n\nWhat is remarkable about the PSM approach is just how simple it is in execution. The method consists of 4 questions:\n\nToo expensive: At what price would you consider product X to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it? Too cheap: At what price would you consider product X to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn’t be very good? Expensive/Acceptable: At what price would you consider product X starting to get expensive, so that it is not out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it? Inexpensive/Good Bargain\n\nFor van Westendorp,\n\nThe Optimum Price : The intersection where an equal number of customers see the brand as “too cheap” and “too expensive”.\n\nThe Range of Acceptable Prices : The range of acceptable prices. Pricing outside this range will severely limit sales.\n\nThe Normal Price : the price that customers feel the product or service sells for or could sell for.\n\nA Value Index : Divide the optimum price by the actual price and multiply by 100. The more the Value Index exceeds 100, the greater the willingness of the customer to pay more than the actual selling price for the product. And, so conversely, the more the Value Index falls below 100, the less likely customers are to pay the actual selling price.\n\nThe way you set prices does not just influence demand. Pricing drives brand-value perceptions. Research shows that if a price is too low, it can dangerously hurt a brand by impacting quality perceptions. Too many deals also have a detrimental effect on the brand. Pricing is a wallet issue. But, it is also a psychological issue. Making sure the brand’s price is right is critical. As the van Westendorp model demonstrates, setting prices does not have to be complex. Sometimes simplicity is the best approach. Nevertheless, what is your pricing strategy?\n\nBrand value decisions need to be strategic. What is the customer-perceived fair value for your brand? How are your marketing efforts affecting customer-perceived value? Is price sensitivity increasing or decreasing? The world does not stand still. A brand may be offered at the same price that previously worked. But today, that same price is too high compared to the competition. Your brand may not be able to sustain a price today that was considered fair and reasonable in the past. Why? Is it the marketing? Are there changes in quality perception? Is it the evolution of the competitive environment?. Or the brand may have stood still while alternative brands have improved and evolved, raising customer expectations. Excessive emphasis on price incentives may severely damage brand loyalty and brand value.\n\nAs the Trump tariffs begin to have a pricing effect, here are seven things brands can do when it comes to pricing strategy:\n\nContributed to Branding Strategy Insider by: Joan Kiddon, Partner, The Blake Project, Author of The Paradox Planet: Creating Brand Experiences For The Age Of I\n\nAt The Blake Project, we help clients worldwide, in all stages of development, define or redefine and articulate what makes them competitive at pivotal moments of change.

Copying the Constitution", "fullContent": "It is sometimes said that democracy wants education. Also: strong foundations make for good buildings. And: the more larnin’, the more votin’. So, the other night, when three New Yorkers showed up at the Old Stone House, a re-created 1699 farmhouse turned community center in Brooklyn, to take part in a social art project in which they would each write out a copy of the Constitution—or as much of the Constitution as they could in two hours—nothing less than the fate of the nation seemed to be at stake. One participant, upon sitting at one of the four tables in the house’s great room and eying the Uniball pen and xeroxed Constitution before her, cleared her throat with a vehemence that seemed to augur spitting.\n\nMorgan O’Hara, an eighty-four-year-old conceptual artist who was raised in Japan, started handwriting documents that are meant to protect human rights—a practice she calls “activism for introverts”—in 2017. Appalled by the level of discourse in the 2016 Presidential election, she decided that copying out the Constitution in a public place would provide consolation by deepening her understanding of the document. She saw no need to talk about the Constitution, though. “There have been so many experiences in my life where I have a lot to say but the extroverts always win,” she said the other day, over the phone from Venice, where she lives now. So O’Hara took herself to the New York Public Library’s majestic Rose Reading Room with pen and paper and got monkish.\n\n“I told one of my studio neighbors about it, and she asked, ‘Can I put it on Facebook? People want to share it with their friends.’ It spread that way.” Since that initial foray, more than two thousand people across the world—from Taipei to Toronto to Berlin—have hand-copied their own relevant rights-bearing documents, in a hundred and forty-seven public writing sessions. Participating institutions have included Paris’s Bibliothèque Nationale, Harvard’s David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, the central library in Macau, and a women’s correctional facility in New Hampshire.\n\nAt the Old Stone House, the three people who showed up to join the venue’s director of education, Maggie Weber, were all female Brooklynites: a political-science student, an attorney turned novelist, and a middle-school teacher. The U.S. Constitution is famously short—4,543 words, or 7,591 if you include all twenty-seven amendments—but don’t tell that to someone tasked with writing it down, which can take twelve hours. (The Old Stone House will host sessions on the first Monday of each month for the rest of the year.) The four women, studiously bent over their work, looked by turns irritated, amused, and exhausted. One of those present thought, Why does the phrase “foreign emoluments” always make me think of Bain de Soleil?\n\nFifteen minutes before the end of the session, the women started talking politics. “Right now, we have a Department of Justice that’s answering to the executive branch,” the attorney-novelist said. “But that’s not how it was set up.” They discussed Mitch McConnell’s legacy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s reluctance to retire. The poli-sci student confessed, “I was secretive about coming to this. I thought, Am I crazy to do this?”\n\nThe attorney-novelist said, “Section 2, paragraph 3, brought me up short.” She read aloud the passage about how the apportionment of “Representatives and direct Taxes” would exclude “Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.” The middle-school teacher commented on the irony that one of the Constitution’s “shortest articles, the one about the judicial branch, is also the least understood one, but it’ll be the most important one for getting us out of our current mess.”\n\nO’Hara, who has written out the Constitution in full three times, said, in a phone call, “It’s a very calming experience. And when you’re calm you make better decisions.” She went on, “What really surprised me was the structure—that the executive is in between the judiciary and the legislative. That was a big relief when I found that out. And it shocked me how long it took for women to get the vote, and how long for slaves to be considered people.”\n\nAt the Old Stone House, the mood was a mixture of satisfaction and unease. The attorney-novelist said, “Maybe we should do this with Congress.” The others laughed.\n\nTariffs were in the news. Someone mentioned Article I, Section 10, which details duties and imports being “subject to the Revision and Controul of the Congress.” But these days, it was observed, even “controul” is out of control. ♦"}

Think Alexa, but way more advanced.\n\nLast month, ChatGPT received an update that drastically improved its voice mode, making it interrupt you less often for conversations that flow better and feel more human.

As an exercise, I surveyed reviews of translated literary fiction and poetry in the New York Review of Books, the London Review of Books, and the Australian Book Review over the course of 2023.2 I wanted to see how much translated literature was reviewed, and how it was done. What did the reviewers notice?\n\nIn terms of the frequency of reviews, the winner by a country mile was the NYRB, with thirty-two reviews of translated literary fiction and poetry over twenty issues (and another eight reviews of translated non-fiction). It was difficult to find an issue where there was not at least one review of translated literature. The LRB was no slouch either, with twenty-six reviews of fiction and poetry over twenty-four issues (and another seven reviews of non-fiction). The ABR trailed a long way down – at only nine reviews of translated literary fiction and poetry over twenty-two issues (and another seven non-fiction). Notably, only the NYRB included the source language in the review titles. The fact that the other journals did not is often problematic; a curious reader has to look for clues to discover the original language in which the book under review was written. Overall, the review articles fell into three categories: those that focused on a single book; those that focused on the work of a single author, with more than one translated book by the same or various translators; and reviews of recent re-translations of well-known (usually old) books.\n\nOf the thirty-two NYRB reviews, nineteen of them discuss the translation, many in detail. This compares to thirteen of the LRB’s twenty-six reviews, and only three of the ABR’s nine reviews. The other reviews either do not mention the translation at all or make an unsubstantiated comment (‘ably translated by’, ‘superbly translated by’, an ’elegant’, ‘meticulous’, ‘capable’, ‘dexterous’, ‘perfect pitch, ‘fluid’, ‘flawed’, or ‘readable’ translation, and so forth). When I say ‘unsubstantiated’, I mean that the reviewers do not explain how they arrived at their judgement: they are merely making a passing comment on the English and how it reads to them. The prose or verse reads elegantly, so it is an ‘elegant translation’. But the translation and how the English reads are not the same thing. One might rather say, ‘here is an example of the translator’s elegant solution to rendering such-and-such’, showing some thought about the translation. (Sometimes I wonder whether part of the problem in talking in English about translation isn’t the word itself, which can refer ambiguously to both process and product. In the language I translate from, Indonesian, there is a distinction between the act, penerjemahan, and the end result, terjemahan. I am sure this distinction is true of many other languages.)\n\nIn the most engaging reviews, we follow the reviewer’s thoughts about the challenges of the particular translation under review and their familiarity with the original language. They comment on choices made. They ask interesting questions. We learn something. Take, for instance, the novelist Anjum Hasan’s review in the NYRB of the IBP prize-winning book, Tomb of Sand, by Geetanjali Shree, translated from the Hindi by Daisy Rockwell. Hasan praises the translation for its ‘recreation of Shree’s animated, conversational, on occasion rambling style’, and gives examples. She points out the novel’s language play and the translator’s handling of this, and again gives examples. She talks about translation in general and how ‘a book and its translation inevitably speak to different things in their separate literatures’, and then gives examples of how this book and its English translation do that. This is a review that teaches the reader about the original and makes you want to read the translation.\n\nWriter and critic Anahid Nersessian similarly moves between the general and the particular in her insightful reviews. Her NYRB essay, ‘The Republic of Translation’, discusses two books of translated poetry from two different authors and two different languages (Italian/Sardinian and French). Drawing her attention back from close discussion of details in the original texts (idiom, rhythm, acoustics, word connotations), she praises Lindsay Turner’s translation from Stephane Bouquét’s French as ‘a whole new object, neither original nor variant, but a lustrous synthesis of sensibilities’. This is high praise, but her review shows us how she came to this view. She can also be wonderfully direct in her criticism. Reviewing two books by Meret Oppenheim – one translated by Lisa Wenger and Martina Corgnati, the other by Kathleen Heil – for the LRB, she again pays close attention to detail and isn’t fooled by the translator’s claims to creative license: ‘There is creative translation or what Heil calls “seizing freedom from the language one is working with”, and then there is making stuff up.’\n\nVeteran reviewers like Parks and Michael Hofmann, renowned translators themselves, always have interesting things to say in their reviews of translated fiction. Apart from general discussion of the (original) book, its author and context, there is analysis of style – tone, voice, idiom and rhythm, for instance – and any other idiosyncrasies – use of dialect, profanity, colloquialism, humour – as well as commentary on how the translator has navigated the challenges of rendering these stylistic characteristics. Both sides of the work – the book and its translation – are considered, sometimes sharply. In his review of Jonathan Franzen and Jenny Watson’s translation of a Thomas Brussig novel in the NYRB, Hofmann rips the original book apart, then asks the all-important (but so rarely asked) question, ‘why translate it?’ He gives an example of East German slang rendered as Kansas English, and comments on wordplay. ‘Sometimes’, he says, ‘the language is telling us, “Uh-oh, don’t touch this,” and then it’s probably worth listening.’\n\nOne part of the reviewing world where close attention is paid to creative choice in translation – indeed, to creative choice as the art of translation – is the case of re-translation. This is where we do find recognition, and celebration, of myriad possibilities in rendering a text into another language. This is exactly where we delight in reading and hearing the familiar in a new way, as with Emily Wilson’s translation of The Odyssey, or Seamus Heaney’s translation of Beowulf. Reviews of re-translations proceed from the awareness of difference between the original (the worth of which has been established by the very fact of its perpetuity) and its translated renditions – and perhaps it is not surprising that these reviews can be so illuminating about translation in general. The existence of previous translations pushes the reviewer to look not just for ‘fluidity’ or ‘smoothness’ in the translated text, but also for how this new version might make us think about context and interpretation. A wonderful example of this is Michael Wood’s review of Brian Nelson’s 2024 translation of the first volume of Proust’s À la recherche du temps perdu, The Swann Way, alongside James Grieve’s translation, Swann’s Way, first published in 1982. Wood offers deep reflections on changes in interpretation not just of the literary work, but of the entire social world that shaped it. The reprinting of Grieve’s version, Wood says, ‘is a perfect invitation to time-travel in the world of translation’. He adds:"}

Among other things, it explains that TPM can encrypt your files, control software on your computer, and prevent people from physically changing the hardware in your computer.\n\nWhile there are indeed some security benefits to Windows 11 and TPM, the key thing here is that Microsoft made TPM 2.0 a non-negotiable system requirement for Windows 11, which is why so many older Windows 10 PCs aren’t eligible to upgrade—and even after all this time, Microsoft is resolute in that requirement.\n\nIf you’re still on Windows 10 but your system doesn’t meet the TPM spec or any other requirement for Windows 11, you don’t have to abandon it.

If professors, mentors, managers, and parents don’t support young women, we risk losing talented future leaders before they even get started.\n\nAMY GALLO: You’re listening to Women at Work from Harvard Business Review. I’m Amy Gallo.\n\nThink back to your first job out of college. Mine was working as a program manager for a small nonprofit. And while I was incredibly organized and good at moving work forward, a skill I’d honed as an undergrad in those torturous group projects, I was also overconfident and unaware of the more nuanced skills I needed, like how to write an email that would get people to do what I wanted them to or how to relay a decision the executive director had made to my peers. I didn’t have the interpersonal skills that undoubtedly would’ve made me much happier and more effective in that job.\n\nWhy didn’t I learn in college that getting the feedback I needed, building trust, setting boundaries are all part and parcel of success and advancement? Why weren’t those skills in the curriculum?\n\nWith academia’s fixation on career readiness, why are colleges still graduating students who employers say fall short of their expectations in areas like ability to communicate and think critically? That’s what the Association of American Colleges and Universities found when it surveyed executives and hiring managers in 2023. And when NACE, the National Association of Colleges and Employers, surveyed HR directors and managers in 2024, they had similar findings.\n\nIf professors and career counselors and experienced professionals like you and me don’t clue students into the realities of work, we risk losing future leaders before they even get started. Which is why when the organizers of SXSW EDU, the innovation conference focused on the education sector, invited Women at Work to host a session, we decided to talk about how to address these gaps.\n\nWhether you’re teaching college students, parenting one, or managing someone who just landed their first job, I hope this episode gives you a clearer picture of what early-career women are up against in those first few make or break years of work and how you can help. After all, we all have a powerful role to play in making those years more navigable, equitable, and empowering for young women.\n\nThis conversation you’re about to hear was taped live in Austin at SXSW EDU.\n\nHi, y’all. How’s everyone doing? Good. So, I’m excited to be joined by two guests who think a lot about this phase of young women’s lives and what they need to thrive when they’ve entered their careers. My two guests are both Texas-based. Go, Texas.\n\nNeda Norouzi is an architecture professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, and she helped create a student-led organization in architecture, the department that she is part of.\n\nAimee Laun is the Director of the Texas Woman’s University Career Connection Center, and again, thinks a lot about, how do we prepare women for today’s workforce.\n\nI’m going to start with Neda and Aimee. And I want to ask, what is a skill that you were surprised when you first started in the workforce that you did not have? No one told you was necessary, but became critical right away. Neda, we can start with you.\n\nNEDA NOROUZI: I learned a lot, but I think my main one … So, I grew up in Iran. And being a woman in Iran, it was a big deal to be the good girl, being soft-spoken and quiet. So, being in the workforce in America, speaking confidently in meetings was something that took me a while to get a handle of. Or even speaking in general in meetings, especially with client meetings.\n\nNow, I was lucky that I had a supervisor who was a wonderful woman and often gave me the floor and would say, “Well, Neda, you told me about your idea. Why don’t you share it with Mr. or Mrs. So And So?” But even then, I still remember my voice would always shake, and I always doubted myself that I’m saying something wrong or I’m saying something that’s not correct and I might not just know enough. And so I think speaking confidently was the main one.\n\nAMY GALLO: Yeah. But I assume you spoke up in classes during university. What was the difference?\n\nNEDA NOROUZI: Actually, I didn’t. I was the student who would always sit in the front, take notes, and I would never say anything unless I was asked.\n\nAMY GALLO: And no professor said, “You’re going to need to learn to speak up.”\n\nNEDA NOROUZI: None in undergrad, no.\n\nAMY GALLO: Right.\n\nNEDA NOROUZI: I had a professor who told me to take a class in the speech department. And that helped a lot, academically and professionally.\n\nAMY GALLO: Yeah. Aimee, how about you? What’s a skill you were surprised to learn was necessary when you got into the workforce?\n\nAIMEE LAUN: This is going to sound so simple, but the most impressive thing in my first job that I learned about was from my boss, Lisa Ortiz. She was very productive. She was starting a business, and I went to work for her. And she used a planner called the Quo Vadis Planner, and it was beautiful. It had a leather cover on it. And inside, it had a calendar for taking notes and dates. And I saw her using that, and then she would ask me, she says, “We have some deliveries coming in.” It was a retail shop. “These dates and times.” And I was trying to keep all that in my head. And I thought back to her, like, Oh, I need to write this down. And no one ever told me, when your boss is speaking, you need to take notes.\n\nAnd so I went down to, in San Antonio, the Nancy Harkins Stationery store, and I bought me a Quo Vadis planner. I still have that habit today. Planner, and I’ve got my calendar and my agenda and my notes and indexes. And so I think women observe other women. That’s how we learn. And so her teaching me that best practice, just through my observation of her, has been something that’s helped me to be successful in my career.\n\nAMY GALLO: Yeah. For me, it was really negotiation. And I don’t mean negotiating a salary, just that pretty much every conversation in work was a negotiation, right? How are we going to move ahead with this project? Are you going to listen to my idea or their idea? What’s the budget going to be? And no one taught me how to navigate the power dynamics when they weren’t as crystal clear as student-professor. And I think that was a thing that was really surprising to me, is how much I needed those negotiation skills every day, all day.\n\nAimee and Neda, what’s a question that you’ve gotten from a current student or a former student that has indicated to you that they’re not at all prepared for the workforce? Or that perhaps they’re actually more prepared than you expected? Aimee, we can start with you.\n\nAIMEE LAUN: It’s not the questions they’re asking, but it’s the questions they’re not asking because they don’t know what to ask. So, when teaching negotiation skills, which is one thing we teach in the career center, they don’t know that they can advocate for themselves, that they can ask for a different office, a parking spot, the benefits, an extra day off. They just don’t know the questions to ask. So supporting women who are younger, the junior women coming in, coming out of college, the more we can advocate for them, be the one that asks the questions.\n\nAMY GALLO: Now, you both are in academia now, and I assume most people here are similar organizations, but you both have corporate experience as well. How does that influence the way you talk to students about what they need to be prepared for?\n\nNEDA NOROUZI: So, I worked in an architectural firm right after I got my master’s degree. And I think I always tell my students, school is kind of this la-la land that we get to do what we want and not necessarily have to deal with a lot of the challenges that come in the real world, especially when it comes to speaking to clients, right?\n\nArchitecture students, when they design a project, they spend 17 weeks. And they’re, as they like to say, “I’m married to it,” right? So, I would always tell them that, it’s not about you, but it is about the client. So, when you’re presenting your project, instead of saying, “I like this,” just say, “This is how this building is designed to …” Right? And that would help you practice how you speak to your clients. Because if you’re telling your client, “This project was designed for you, and this is how it’s going to respond to your needs,” there’s a much higher chance that they would hire you than the next person.\n\nI still try to stay very active in the real world and do consulting work and design work, so then I know what it is that students need when they get out there.\n\nAMY GALLO: Aimee, how about you?\n\nAIMEE LAUN: So, I grew up in a small town in West Texas. My dad was a preacher, and my mom was a teacher. I thought those were the only two jobs. And so I learned a lot, and I learned it the hard way, just by trial and error. I didn’t have a lot of mentors at the time.\n\nSo, I worked for Philip Morris International. And I remember my interview for that job. They sent me, a small town, West Texas girl, to New York City. I’d never been in a city larger than Dallas. So here I go to … On a plane for the first time, seven interviews in the day, and then we went to dinner that evening. Everything was a learning experience through that interview. Even when we went to dinner in New York City at 10:00 PM, I was like, Wait. Really? The restaurant was so nice. Half of the things on the menu were in French. And so I did the, Let me see what Val, the one person that I knew there, what is she ordering? And I just said, “I’ll have what she’s having.”\n\nI think having Val there as a mentor and to say, Okay. If she’s doing this, I can do this too, really did help me. And I try to teach that to our students: find a mentor, find a sponsor, find someone you just think looks really cool in the office and you want to be like them. And you can learn a lot just from observation and from being in their presence. You have those people in your life where you feel like, I got so much energy just out of going to Starbucks and getting coffee with this one person than I did learning in a training class. So, that’s one thing I took from the corporate world, that we can really teach each other to be successful in those environments.\n\nAnd I also learned a lot about office politics, that titles mean something. And whether you like it or not, it does have power. And you can be polite, poised, and professional, and still powerful. And I think that’s what working in corporate America taught me the most.\n\nAMY GALLO: Yeah. We did an episode about sponsorship and how it differs from mentorship and how to get a sponsor. And it’s the episode I hear most often women tell me, “I sent it to my daughter” or “I sent it to my niece.” Because I think that is also a skill. People are not warned that you don’t just go in and your work speaks for yourself. You need allies. You need people who are going to advocate for you in the organization.\n\nLet’s get into some of the skills. So, NACE outlines these competencies that they say are essential for career readiness. So career and self-development, communication, critical thinking, equity and inclusion, leadership, professionalism, teamwork, and technology.\n\nThinking about trying to equip students with all of those skills is overwhelming. And yet, we also know that list is not complete. When we think about what we’ve learned on the podcast and what we’ve learned from our guests and our listeners, there is so much more. Negotiation, advocacy, how to balance remote work, boundaries, and how to deal with emotional labor, how to deal with bias that gets sent your way, and all of the things we’ve already talked about.\n\nSo, I want to get into what you’re doing to equip students with some of these things that aren’t on the NACE list. Let’s start with negotiation. Aimee, especially in your career center, how are you thinking about negotiation skills and giving women the skills they need, not just to negotiate a salary, but to negotiate all aspects of a job?\n\nAIMEE LAUN: You’re right. It’s not always just about money. It’s about what else is out there. And so we, at Texas Woman’s University, we’re very passionate about the pay gap, the gender pay gap. And so we teach students about that. For every $1 a man earns, a woman earns 84 cents. The only way that we’re going to change that is through advocating for each other and through teaching each other. And I see there’s some men in the room—not to pick on you, but we need you to advocate for us in the workplace.\n\nAMY GALLO: And we also need you to tell us what you earn because we’re not even often aware of the pay gap. And so it’s really helpful. The more information we have, especially from men, the more we can understand whether we need to do some advocacy, we need to do some negotiation.\n\nAIMEE LAUN: Yes. And so I think as women, we’re taught to be respectful of our elders and quiet. And we’re made a job offer and we go into freeze mode, and we aren’t thinking of the next step or what we need to be asking for. And so we try and teach women emotional intelligence and balancing your emotions in discussions like that that can be emotional, but important. And so getting women to advocate for themselves is the main thing in salary negotiations, and also in other life negotiations.\n\nNEDA NOROUZI: The student organization, the Women in Architecture group, negotiation is one of the topics we’ve had. A lot of students who get a job, and as a student or as a recent graduate, when you get an offer, you’re just happy. And students often tell me, “Are you sure?” And I told this to one student, “If you’re not doing it for you, do it for all the women who would come after you.” And she did. She got everything she asked for.\n\nAnd then later on, a student who had never had a class with me came to me in school and said, “You don’t know me, but I spoke to this person who you had told to ask for more for all the women that come after her. So she told me this, and I did too. So, I wanted to say thank you because I got a higher salary, and I got time to spend with my mom, who’s not doing really well.”\n\nSo yeah, just knowing that you can ask. And if they say no, they say no, you don’t lose anything, right? But that’s something that I didn’t know and makes me really happy when I hear that students are doing it now.\n\nAMY GALLO: Let’s talk about another skill, dealing with bias and sexism. I am so on the fence about how to handle this question for the young people in my life, particularly my 18-year-old daughter. On the one hand, I want to tell her how it’s going to be. On the other, I do not want to scare her. And I’m curious how you handle this with the students that you mentor and lead? Aimee?\n\nAIMEE LAUN: It’s not a topic that we put at the forefront, but when students ask us those questions, we are able to have honest discussions with them. But we try and go back to, what does the research say, and base it on factual evidence and talk about, Oh, here are the facts about women and men and the workplace. And even age in the workplace and what impact it could have on their future career. I think it’s in the back of their minds but not spoken about a lot.\n\nAMY GALLO: Yeah. I’m glad you brought up age too because that’s … When we say ageism, I think we often think about discrimination against people who are older. But students, one of the biggest things they face, one of the biggest isms or biases often is ageism. And compounded when that intersects with sexism can be quite demoralizing, dismissive, undermining. So, I’m glad you brought that up. Neda, do those conversations come up in your group as well?\n\nNEDA NOROUZI: They do. Students were saying, “If you are a young person who is just starting your career at an architectural firm, you’re expected to know all the technology and how all the computer programs work. And then you are used for that.” So, what I tell my students is, “Okay. So you have identified the problem. Let’s now find a solution for it.” So, we talk through it and then we find articles to read together and see what’s the best way to deal with the specific situation that they’re in, which often then starts a conversation in a bigger picture. And then we bring it back to our general meeting and talk about it together.\n\nAMY GALLO: When I think about 22-year-old me who entered the workforce, the idea of finding solutions for problems was not a skill I had. I was really good at pointing out problems I thought other people should solve, but was not good at figuring out. So, I think thinking about how do you propose not just this is something wrong, but also how do you actually propose what can be done.\n\nSimilarly, I was not very good at picking my battles. I felt like everything was worth burning down the organization for, which I had to learn very quickly was not the case. I want to pivot a little bit. It wouldn’t be a conversation at SXSW if we didn’t talk about technology and AI. Aimee, how is your center using technology to either understand the skills that women need as they enter the workforce or to prepare them?\n\nAIMEE LAUN: Let me come back to AI. I want to say something about that last topic.\n\nAMY GALLO: Oh, yeah.\n\nAIMEE LAUN: One thing we do teach … And you’ve made a really good point of me at 22, and how did I handle this? We teach the Circle of Influence and Circle of Concern because we’re going to be concerned about a lot of things in the workplace. What we have to focus on is what can we influence. And getting students to think to that level of, what do I have control over, and let’s focus on that.\n\nBut the career center at Texas Woman’s University, we use AI quite a lot. And we’re teaching students how to write prompts and how to edit what the AI generates for you. And if it’s on your resume, are you going to be able to talk about it in an interview? Or is this something that just sounded good?\n\nAnd we’re also starting to use some data mining tools to see, where are students going, not just for their first destination, which has been a common metric in career centers all over for a long time. First destination, where are they going? And then we end. So, what we’re trying to do now is, where are they at in five years? And how did they get there? Where are they in 10 years? And how did they get there? And with data mining sources like Bureau of Labor Statistics and LinkedIn profiles and things like that, we can start to mine and follow our students a little bit further, even out to 10 years, and how did they get there? And then use that for coaching students because students think they’re going to be the CEO in three weeks. And it’s like we got to show them this progression, that it’s a career progression over time that’s going to make you successful and continue to be challenged and happy in your work. So that’s been really meaningful.\n\nAMY GALLO: That’s great. Neda, are you talking about AI with your students?\n\nNEDA NOROUZI: 100%. So in my classes, since AI became a thing, I introduced it to my students. I try to learn it as much as I can myself, constantly, daily basis, right? And then what I would do usually for an assignment is I say, “This is your topic. Have ChatGPT write it. Bring it to class.” And then I would have one-on-one sessions with them and have them analyze it with me. “So, do you agree with what it’s written?” And that usually I see these light bulbs going that that’s not what I want to say.\n\nSo then I bring it to critical thinking. I tell them to use it, whether it’s for quick renderings and ideation or giving it your abstract and having the perfect title for your project, but don’t let it think for you. So that’s generally been my approach to it because students are going to use it. Regardless if I allow it or not, they’re going to do it. So my hope is that I would be able to guide them through the process of using it to help them succeed.\n\nAMY GALLO: So we want to hear from you all. If you have any questions, you can line up here. Hi.\n\nAudience Member: Hello. Thank you, ladies. This was incredible. I also brought my daughter, being 24 and a recent college graduate. So, I would love for you to give both my daughter and everybody in your podcast advice on how you balance coming across being pushy and aggressive to get that first job because you’re also up against men that it’s almost expected from.\n\nNEDA NOROUZI: Yeah. Well-\n\nAMY GALLO: Aimee, do you … Oh, go. Neda, you-\n\nNEDA NOROUZI: Sorry. I just got really excited because I applied for my dream job right out of school. And I sent the application in thinking, They’re never going to call me. Within two hours, I got an email from the principal of the firm. He happened to be in town and had gotten the email and thought, Well, I don’t have any lunch plans. Let’s just meet with this young lady. So I met with him. I ended up not working there. They didn’t hire me. But what he did tell me was keep in touch. And then I said, “Sure. But how often can I keep in touch?” He said, “Contact us as much as you want until we tell you not to.” Because what he told me was that, “We get a lot of emails. It’s not personal. It’s not about you. It’s just about we don’t have time. But if you keep sending emails, if you show up and say, ‘Hi. Yes, I applied here, and I was just wondering if I could talk to so-and-so,’ then they would know that you’re actually more interested than maybe the next person.”\n\nAIMEE LAUN: And Neda made a really good point. It’s human to human connection. If you’re not networking, you’re not working. That’s what we tell our students. You’ve got to get out there. You’ve got to make eye contact, shake hands, stand up tall, be a presence. If you’re sitting behind a Zoom screen waiting for someone to email you, it’s never going to happen. So in-person, human to human, we cannot forget that. If you’re going to an association meeting or a conference or a networking event, grab a student. Take them with you. If you don’t know what student to grab, call me. I’ll connect you. I’ve got a lot on the list.\n\nAMY GALLO: As a mom, I hope my daughter will have professors like Neda and career center directors like Aimee, who make invisible expectations much more visible. As a colleague, I know I can do that for someone else’s kid by saying, “It’s okay to ask for that,” or, “Let me show you how I handle this.”\n\nSomeone came up to me after the recording in Austin and told me that one of the things she has done is to write a letter to her younger self with all the things she wished she had known back then. And she shares this letter with the young women that she mentors in her life.\n\nSo, if someone came to mind while you were listening, a colleague who works with students, a friend navigating the early stages of her career, or a fellow manager who’s mentoring a new hire, send this episode their way.\n\nWomen at Work’s editorial and production team is Amanda Kersey, Maureen Hoch, Tina Tobey Mack, Hannah Bates, Rob Eckhardt, and Ian Fox.

Kennedy, Jr. has made many puzzling statements about health policy over the years (BBC Verify Team, 2024). Among his infamous and oft-repeated claims is that autism is closely linked to childhood vaccinations (BBC Verify Team, 2024). However, all good scientists know that this claim is patently false. Despite Kennedy’s unremitting insistence to the contrary, years of rigorous research have yielded widespread consensus in the scientific community that autism is not caused by vaccines (Demicheli et al., 2012; DeStefano, 2002; DeStefano & Shimabukuro, 2019; Hviid et al., 2019; Mohammed et al., 2022; L. E. Taylor et al., 2014). Yet Kennedy remains undeterred. With his powerful new government appointment, RFK's stance is proving extremely costly: He recently decreed that he would spend taxpayer money to reinvestigate and relitigate settled science on the \"environmental\" (a.k.a. \"vaccine\") causes of autism (Stein & Wroth, 2025). While the government cuts scientific funding almost everywhere else (Wadman, 2025), Kennedy is wasting precious time and resources on discredited fringe theories.\n\nTo add insult to injury, this week, RFK spoke about autism in ways that are not only inaccurate and stigmatizing but also demeaning and paternalistic. As he put it:\n\nAutism destroys families, and more importantly, it destroys our greatest resource, which is our children. These are children who should not be suffering like this. These are kids who will never pay taxes. They'll never hold a job. They'll never play baseball. They'll never write a poem. They'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\n\nKennedy may be ginning up support for his anti-vaccine position by diminishing those with autism, erroneously portraying them as dysfunctional invalids. It is an odd way to \"assist\" them.\n\nThe criteria for autism in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed., text revision; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2022) are not limited to the relatively small percentage of people whose symptoms are so severe that they are unable to care for themselves. On the contrary, most people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder are highly functional; they are neurodivergent, not mentally disordered. Kennedy's dehumanizing portrayal makes them unrecognizable. His protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, many people with autism spectrum diagnoses do indeed pay taxes and hold down jobs. Some even play baseball and/or write poems. For better or worse, they inhabit a world where diagnostic identities often dominate (Singh, 2024), yet this does not necessitate demeaning them and wrongly portraying them in the stark terms Kennedy invokes.\n\nContrary to what Kennedy says, the current diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder include not just severe cases but also all those that used to fall under the now defunct milder diagnosis of Asperger's disorder. That is the very reason why the official diagnosis is called autism spectrum disorder; those diagnosed with it fall along a spectrum, from mild to severe. Thus, the rising number of diagnoses is partly explained by changing diagnostic conceptions. It is also explained by greater awareness, leading to fewer cases flying under the radar. It is not because of vaccines.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nRFK's crusade against vaccines is scientifically suspect. People on the autism spectrum are best thought of as different, not disordered. Like all of us, with love and support, they lead happy and healthy lives. RFK's characterization of those with autism as utterly dysfunctional is demeaning and dangerous. Autism occurs on a spectrum and most people carrying the diagnosis live productive lives, even when they require services and support. Kennedy's pathologization of those with autism obscures the inaccuracy of his broader views on vaccinations."}

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nCities having higher ambient temperatures than rural surroundings (known as the urban heat island effect) could offset some of the negative effects of increased heat-related mortality by reducing the number of deaths associated with cold exposure in some global cities, according to a study in Nature Climate Change. These findings highlight the importance of developing region- and season-specific strategies to mitigate the urban heat island effect.\n\nThe urban heat island effect contributes to an increase in human heat exposure and subsequent death globally during hotter seasons. However, this phenomenon could also impact the rate of cold-related deaths in cooler conditions. This dual impact could vary across regions and seasons, but previous research has often focused on the effect at the local scale. In the context of climate change and rapid urbanization, it is important to understand the broader impact of the urban heat island effect on both heat- and cold-related deaths for urban heat mitigation strategies.\n\nWenfeng Zhan and colleagues analyzed multiple data sources, including remote sensing data and climate and socioeconomic factors (such as Gross Domestic Product), to establish mortality–temperature relationships across more than 3,000 cities worldwide. They found that the reduction in cold-related mortality under the urban heat island effect is 4.4 times greater than the increase in heat-related mortality in 2018.\n\nImpacts of the UHI effect on cold- and heat-related mortality in global cities. Credit: Nature Climate Change (2025). DOI: 10.1038/s41558-025-02303-3\n\nZhan and colleagues further observed that cities at high latitudes saw an even higher reduction—Moscow, for example, saw a reduction in cold-related deaths that was 11.5 times greater than those associated with heat. The authors further analyzed the role of increasing vegetation and the reflectivity of buildings (albedo), which are current strategies to mitigate the urban heat island effect.\n\nThey found that these strategies could result in an increase in cold-related deaths that surpasses heat-related deaths globally depending on the magnitude of the intervention and the season in which it is implemented.\n\nThe authors emphasize that their findings should not be interpreted as downplaying the negative health outcomes of the urban heat island effect but instead offer crucial insights into the specifics of its impact across seasons. They further suggest that cities must take a seasonal approach to mitigating the urban heat island effect."}

Ogles, a Freedom Caucus member in his second term, often films himself in front of a reproduction of “Washington Crossing the Delaware,” the painting by Emanuel Leutze. “What you have here is a moment in time that comes along once in a century,” he says in a clip called “The Case for Trump 2028,” in which he proposes that the President run for a third term. In another video, he walks through his office, with a chyron introducing him as “Judge Impeacher/Congressman.” Ogles recently filed articles of impeachment against several judges who have blocked executive orders issued by Trump. “Political hacks and their decisions belong in my SHREDDER,” he writes in a post promoting the video. Toward the end, he feeds a judicial ruling into an actual paper shredder. “Sicko Mode,” by Travis Scott, plays in the background.\n\nOgles began the year under investigation by the Office of Congressional Ethics and the F.B.I. They were looking into allegations that he had violated federal campaign-finance laws by falsely reporting a three-hundred-and-twenty-thousand-dollar loan to himself, something Ogles maintained was an “honest mistake.” (He had also allegedly raised nearly twenty-five thousand dollars on GoFundMe for a “burial garden” for stillborn babies—a project that donors say never materialized.) Before Inauguration Day, when Trump first displayed an interest in Greenland, Ogles proposed the Make Greenland Great Again Act, a bill authorizing the President to try to acquire it from Denmark. (The U.S. is a “dominant predator,” Ogles said.) Ten days later, just after Trump was sworn in, Ogles announced his bid to allow the President to serve a third term, by changing the Twenty-second Amendment to the Constitution. “If the man who created the disastrous ‘New Deal’ gets more than two terms, then the man who created ‘The Art of the Deal’ should get the same,” he said. The following week, in a Fox Business appearance, he echoed an assertion by Trump that D.E.I. might have caused a fatal plane crash over the Potomac River. Federal prosecutors withdrew their investigation into Ogles the next day.\n\nBrazen transaction mixed with humbling obeisance is hardly unknown in Washington. “Shame is for sissies,” the late lobbyist Edward von Kloberg used to say. (He referred to his clients, among them Saddam Hussein, as “the damned.”) In Trump’s Washington, the imperative has never been more plain: if you want to get ahead or stay out of trouble, praise the President as much as he praises himself. “You are the leader of the world,” Archbishop Elpidophoros, of the Greek Orthodox Church, said, at a recent celebration in the White House’s East Room. “You remind me of the great Roman emperor Constantine the Great.” The crowd cheered. Elpidophoros presented Trump with a gold cross—the symbol, he remarked, that led Constantine to victory. “Wow,” Trump replied, as he cradled the cross. “I didn’t know that was going to happen, but I’ll take it.”\n\nThe gestures of servility come from all over. At a Cabinet meeting not long ago, Trump’s secretaries took turns: “Your vision is a turning point and inflection point in American history” (Brooke Rollins, Agriculture); “You were overwhelmingly elected by the biggest majority—Americans want you to be President” (Pam Bondi, Attorney General); “What you’re doing now is a great service to our country, but ultimately to the world” (Marco Rubio, State). Jeff Bezos, whose business empire can easily be affected by the favor or disdain of the White House, announced that the newspaper he owns, the Washington Post, would no longer welcome opinion columns outside certain boundaries. He redoubled his bow by licensing Trump’s reality-TV show, “The Apprentice,” in order to make reruns of it available to stream on Amazon. (Amazon also paid forty million dollars for the rights to two forthcoming documentary projects on Trump’s wife, Melania.) Senator Ted Cruz, who had once called Trump a “snivelling coward,” “utterly immoral,” “nuts,” and “a pathological liar,” now rushes to compliment the President, along with his main campaign funder and close adviser, Elon Musk; Cruz recently tweeted a photograph of himself with a red Tesla parked on the grounds of the White House. “This may be the coolest thing I’ve ever seen,” he wrote.\n\nThe list goes on. When Trump complained about an unflattering portrait that hung in the Colorado state capitol—“Truly the worst,” he said—the state’s legislature swiftly removed it. In Minnesota, Republicans in the state senate introduced a bill to codify “Trump Derangement Syndrome”—defined as “the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal persons that is in reaction to the policies and presidencies of President Donald J. Trump”—as a mental illness. Law firms are offering pro-bono services to Trump so that he will reverse executive orders that target them; in a memo, the U.S. Attorney in D.C. referred to his staff as “President Trumps’ lawyers.” Brendan Carr, the head of the Federal Communications Commission, wears a gold lapel pin in the shape of Trump’s head.\n\nAt the beginning of April, Trump instituted a tariff regime that sent markets plunging across the world. As losses in the S. & P. 500 neared six trillion dollars, he gloated about the many nations that wanted to negotiate with him. “These countries are calling us up and kissing my ass,” he told the National Republican Congressional Committee. “ ‘Please, please, sir, make a deal. I’ll do anything, sir.’ ” He was also eager to remind any members of Congress who were opposed to his “big beautiful bill,” which called for tax breaks, spending cuts, and stepped-up immigration enforcement, to “stop grandstanding” and just vote for it. “Close your eyes and get there,” he said.\n\nThese days, they almost always do. “There’s never been anybody who has controlled that much of the base of any party,” Steve Cohen, a longtime Democratic congressman from Memphis, told me. “I don’t even think Franklin Roosevelt had that much power.” A person close to the Administration said, “Trump’s dealmaking often comes through a public assault.” Ralph Norman, a Freedom Caucus member from South Carolina, told me, “This is a blood sport now, more so than I’ve ever seen it.” Or, as a person close to Trump put it, “Republicans have an authority problem. Donald Trump is teaching them how to respect order.”\n\n“NO DISSENT,” Trump recently posted on Truth Social. He was addressing House Republicans ahead of a vote on a stopgap funding bill. A lack of dissent is not what the Founders envisioned for the deliberative branch. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson assumed that Congress would be the strongest arm of the federal government. Madison wrote, in Federalist No. 48, that “the legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.” In 1960, Lyndon B. Johnson, then the Senate Majority Leader, initially balked at an offer to be John F. Kennedy’s running mate, because he felt it would be a downgrade from the role he already had.\n\nAnd yet it now seems that Congress—with both houses controlled by Republicans—exists to do little else but flatter the man who lives at the other end of the Mall, and ratify his edicts. A week after Trump was inaugurated, Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican congresswoman from Florida, proposed legislation that would direct the Secretary of the Interior “to arrange for the carving of the figure of President Donald J. Trump on Mount Rushmore National Memorial.” “Let’s get carving,” she tweeted. The freshman congressman Brandon Gill’s third piece of legislation, the Golden Age Act of 2025, would require all hundred-dollar bills to feature an image of Trump. (This violates an 1866 law that forbids the Treasury to put the likeness of a living person on currency.) Claudia Tenney, a New York Republican, introduced a bill to make Trump’s birthday, June 14th, a federal holiday. “Just as George Washington’s birthday is codified as a federal holiday, President Trump’s birthday should also be celebrated to recognize him as the founder of America’s Golden Age,” she posted. Addison McDowell, of North Carolina, wants a new name for Washington’s Dulles Airport: Trump International. Last month, Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, announced that he was nominating Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. “No one deserves it more,” Issa said.\n\nIn late March, I sat in on a hearing of the House Committee on Natural Resources, where a dozen or so members were discussing the Gulf of America Act of 2025, sponsored by Marjorie Taylor Greene. Her bill would require Trump’s new name for the Gulf of Mexico to be implemented across the government’s vast bureaucracy. Jared Huffman, the ranking Democratic member, leaned into the microphone. “There is crazy, destructive, incompetent, corrupt things happening in the executive branch of our government right now, and the independent branch of government, the Article One branch that our Founders created in order to serve as a check on Presidential abuses of power, as a check on corruption and incompetence, is totally missing in action,” he said.\n\n“Let me repeat your order back to you, pronounced correctly.” Cartoon by Robert Leighton Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nAs a staffer positioned a map of the “Gulf of America” behind Greene, I noticed a man slip quietly into the hearing room—this was Brian Glenn, Greene’s boyfriend and a pro-Trump TV anchor. Glenn got his start at Right Side Broadcasting Network, which emerged in 2015 by marketing itself as a channel that truthfully showed the size of Trump’s campaign crowds. (He is now the White House correspondent for Real America’s Voice, another right-wing media outlet.) Greene smiled at him, then introduced a slate of expert witnesses she had brought in to speak about how renaming the Gulf of Mexico would bolster national security.\n\nHuffman’s mood seemed to darken further. “This is remarkable new stuff in this committee, just bootlicking sycophancy of the highest order,” he said. (Not long after the hearing, Huffman suggested an amendment to rename Earth “Planet Trump.” This, he said, would amount to skating “where the puck is going.”) Discussion in the committee room turned to a bill authorizing the purchase of tracking devices for fish living in the Great Lakes, and another to remove the gray wolf from the federal endangered-species list. Groups of touring schoolchildren occasionally filtered in and out.\n\nLater, I caught up with Glenn at the White House. He was standing around waiting to go on air from “Pebble Beach,” the long driveway leading up to the West Wing, where the various networks have little green cabanas from which anchors and officials broadcast. Glenn is tan and has a puffy face. (He addressed his puffiness on a recently televised segment about the drinking habits of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. “It’s called allergies,” Glenn said. “And it’s called testosterone. That’s why my face gets puffy. I’m not an alcoholic.”) He sees himself as a sort of self-declared liaison between the President and Congress, helping the latter to more efficiently follow the former’s instructions. “Part of my job is to put pressure on Congress,” he told me. “We have to sell the President’s message to them. I want a carrier pigeon to fly straight from Trump’s desk to Speaker Johnson. Like a bank slot where you just put it in here and it comes out there.”"}

DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2411231122\n\nAs evidence continues to pour in showing that climate change's impacts disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities around the globe, so too do stories showing that these communities can also pay outsized costs to implement climate solutions.\n\nYet, in examining the available body of data and literature detailing how different countries have rolled out climate change mitigation strategies, research led by the University of Michigan has found reasons for optimism.\n\nThe work is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\"It's not all doom and gloom,\" said report author Peter Reich, professor at the U-M School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) and director of the Institute for Global Change Biology.\n\n\"I think there's an expectation that poor countries have to pollute to bring a middle-class life to most of its people, like we did. But we've seen some low-middle-income countries start to decarbonize through investing in renewables and increasing energy efficiency. And they are lowering their emissions while reducing income inequality and increasing the well-being of their people.\"\n\nAt the same time, Reich said, it's all too easy to find cases where vulnerable peoples experience negative consequences from investments in renewables. Take, for example, Indigenous people who have been forced off of their land to build a hydroelectric dam. In fact, that was part of the inspiration for the new study.\n\nThere are hundreds of research articles and as many pages of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports that highlight such inequities. These are found both in the effects of climate change and also in the mitigation strategies used to slow and stop climate change. Reich and his collaborators wanted to extract broader insights by starting to bring those individual reports together under a systematic and comprehensive analytical framework.\n\nIn its new report, the team examined connections between climate impacts, mitigation strategies and social justice considerations, like wealth distribution and overall public health and well-being.\n\nWhile the effort did show certain countries performing better and worse by certain metrics, the team's goal wasn't to rank, praise or critique. It was to find an answer to a much more fundamental question: Is there evidence that it's possible to build up sustainable policies and infrastructure in a just way?\n\n\"Because inequity can result from mitigation actions themselves, sometimes that can have a perverse effect and actually slow down the broader adoption of mitigation strategies,\" said Reich, who is also a professor at the University of Minnesota.\n\nThis slowing has contributed to a dogmatic belief that asking poorer countries to move to renewables is asking their people to suffer, he added.\n\n\"But there's no consistent evidence suggesting that moving to renewable energy has overall negative impacts or consequences for poorer countries or their peoples,\" Reich said. \"If countries are able to invest in renewables, we're seeing cases where it's actually beneficial for their people, it's reducing pollution and it's slowing climate change. It's a win-win-win.\"\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Those countries also saw their emissions and Gini indices, a measure of inequality, drop.\n\n\"We're not saying it's all causally related,\" Reich said. \"But there's no evidence that renewables are getting in the way of equity or economic advancement.\"\n\nAnother important point that Reich stressed is that this does not let wealthy countries with high emissions, such as the U.S., off the hook. They still need to work harder to decarbonize in order to reach international climate goals, he said, but he believes the economic data will compel them to act.\n\n\"Every decade that we wait to take action, we see the cost of climate change damages go up astronomically and the cost of renewables go down,\" Reich said. \"That's not just me, some ecologist, making up these numbers. They come from major corporations and insurers whose jobs are to understand the risks.\"\n\nAlthough he admits time could prove him wrong for feeling this way, Reich does walk away from the team's study with optimism.\n\n\"We're not wide-eyed idealists. The international community hasn't solved this yet, and is not going to solve it tomorrow,\" he said. \"But we can slow and eventually stop climate change, and do so while actually saving money and enhancing environmental justice.\"\n\nThe research team also included Kathryn Grace of the University of Minnesota, Narini Nagendra of Azim Premji University in India and Arun Agrawal of the University of Notre Dame. Agrawal is also an emeritus professor with SEAS."}

Image © Eiichi Kano\n\nThe term \"biophilia\" understandably conjures images of buildings engulfed by vegetation and integrated into natural landscapes. In modern architectural discourse, the concept has come to be associated with the incorporation of greenery into built environments, yet such applications represent only a sliver of biophilic design's true scope. Inarguably, nature plays a central role in biophilic design. However, its influence stretches to often-overlooked strategies that involve spatial configuration and environmental patterning. \"Invisible\" biophilia frequently leads to positive health outcomes for occupants, working impactfully beneath the surface.\n\n+ 4\n\nModern interpretations appear to have diminished the original essence of biophilic design. Social psychologist Erich Fromm first popularized the concept in 1964 to describe the \"love of life\" that he saw as emblematic of organisms and their intrinsic behaviors. In the 1980s, amid the societal reckoning with mass urbanization and detachment from the natural world, biologist Edward Wilson extended the theory to draw focus to human beings' inherent emotional connection to nature.\n\nOur evolutionary reliance on nature is the bedrock of biophilic design in architecture. Although it foregrounds the therapeutic benefits of incorporating plants in spatial design, biophilia centers more on the guiding framework of nature-human connection. It acknowledges that humans evolved within natural settings and still respond positively to natural elements and patterns that ensured survival.\n\nRelated Article What is Salutogenic Architecture?\n\nBiophilic Design Principles\n\nBiophilic design translates these evolutionary preferences into architectural applications. Stephen Kellert's framework for biophilic design outlines three experiential domains: direct experience of nature, indirect experience of nature, and the experience of space and place. Direct experiences often involve literal natural elements like plants and water. These last two categories are characterized by less overt, usually imperceptible, design approaches that can influence human psychology and physiology.\n\nThe indirect experience of nature includes representations of natural elements, such as artwork depicting landscapes, naturally derived materials such as wood and stone, or ornamental patterns inspired by natural forms. The design elements activate similar psychological responses to actual nature encounters without the ongoing maintenance associated with gardening. Also important is reflecting nature's logic - its cycles and sequences - in desing. This manifests as designing around variations in light quality throughout the day or sensory stimulus through textural diversity.\n\nRather than designing nature in space, biophilic principles shift perspectives to explore designing the nature of the space. By focusing on spatial configurations that reflect the environments humans evolved to prefer, invisible design principles address predispositions toward spatial arrangements that tap into instinctive well-being. Research shows that these design principles can reduce stress and improve cognitive performance, even in environments that lack literal natural elements.\n\nNature of the Space: The Invisible Principles\n\nFour design patterns fulfill psychological needs through the arrangement of architectural elements, the choreography of movement, and the manipulation of spatial perception:\n\nProspect addresses our innate desire to see beyond our immediate surroundings and gain a broader perspective. This evolutionary advantage allowed humans to identify both resources and threats. In modern architecture, prospect can be achieved through open floor plans, elevated viewpoints, balconies, and strategic window placement that offers long-distance views. The strategy supports stress reduction and improves concentration by providing a sense of control over one's environment. A sharper awareness of the environment reinforces emotional stability and balance.\n\nRefuge complements \"prospect\" by offering protected spaces that provide security while maintaining visual connection to larger areas. This pattern reflects our ancestral need for safe shelter. Architectural interpretations include alcoves, covered seating areas, lowered ceilings, or partially enclosed spaces within larger environments. These spaces create an atmosphere of psychological comfort, offering a reprieve from mental strain and enabling clearer focus on complex work. Spaces of refuge have been shown to facilitate introverted reflection and small-group interactions, and can be interjected into high-stimulation environments as zones for psychological restoration. This tactic is particularly suited when designing for neurodiverse populations.\n\nMystery engages our natural curiosity through partially obscured views, winding paths, or experiential journies that promise more information with further exploration. The pattern creates a mild, pleasant tension that increases engagement with spaces. Curved hallways, partial screening elements, or gradual reveals through sequenced spaces can create this effect effectively. Translucent materials that hint at activities beyond, or lighting that creates shadows and highlights also aid in this regard. Mystery brings enhanced dopamine release associated with anticipation and discovery, increased spatial memory formation, and a deeper engagement with one's surroundings.\n\nRisk/Peril introduces an identifiable risk with reliable safeguards to induce exhilaration without compromising safety. Examples include height experiences through glass floors or elevated walkways, cantilevered structures, or spaces that appear to defy gravity. Such elements can create engaging experiences that heighten awareness and appreciation of the occupied space. Designs can embody this principle best through cantilevers, water crossings, or structures that create a controlled sense of vertigo. They amplify sensory engagement and encourage being fully present, which enhances place attachment and emotional ties to a space.\n\nSpaces that embody these principles quietly announce their biophilic intent. The application of these principles makes the health benefits of biophilia a cost-efficient approach to occupant well-being, relying purely on spatial arrangement, unlike the more resource-intensive use of plants that requires maintenance and seasonal adjustments. Biophilic architecture is embedded in human perception and psychological responses.\n\nThe incorporation of biophilic design urges architects to consider the user journey of the occupant in a space. Their end-to-end experience - navigating vantage points and circulation paths themselves in volume alterations - becomes a primary consideration. Even in constrained settings or with limited budgets, invisible biophilia can be applied through the manipulation of heights, volumes, sight lines, and pathways. The most effective implementations balance all four elements to build tension between prospect and refuge, mystery and clarity, perceived risk, and actual safety.\n\nMoving Beyond Greenwashing\n\nPlants certainly enhance biophilic spaces, but focusing only on greenery misses the richer possibilities of biophilic design. Vegetation added without considering evolutionary connections to space are a clear example of greenwashing. By complementing it with other strategies from the biophilic designer's toolkit, these features create ecosystems that promote psychological well-being. Just as natural habitats function as interconnected wholes, biophilic spaces must coordinate multiple design strategies to maximize human wellbeing.\n\nOrganizations like the International Living Future Institute and the Biophilic Institute are helping to shape education around biophilic design, advocating for a full spectrum understanding of human-nature connections. Concentrated on pathbreaking projects and research, the Biophilic Leadership Summit unites thought leaders each year to take the field beyond simple applications and into more profound exploration. Similarly, the Living Future Conference explores the role of regenerative and biophilic design in addressing larger environmental and social challenges.\n\nThe biophilic design movement increasingly stresses that practical implementation demands interdisciplinary knowledge spanning psychology, biology, and architectural theory. Rather than following prescriptive formulas or adding token natural elements, architects should understand the underlying principles and adapt them to specific contexts, user needs, and performance goals.\n\nA focus on outcome metrics like stress reduction, cognitive performance, and creativity enhancement moves biophilic design beyond aesthetic considerations to address fundamental human needs. Adopting an evidence-based approach identifies that while plants contribute to biophilic environments, the invisible spatial qualities of prospect, refuge, mystery, and complexity often exert equal or greater influence on human experience.\n\nThis article is part of the ArchDaily Topics: Building Wellbeing: Designing Spaces for Healing, presented in collaboration with the Hushoffice.\n\nWith its line of A-class pods Hushoffice helps create acoustically balanced workplaces that offer great environment for collaboration and focus, foster employee wellbeing, and accommodate the needs of neurodiverse staff, as well as employees with motor impairments.\n\nEvery month we explore a topic in-depth through articles, interviews, news, and architecture projects.

Unconscious Mind was not a Final Frontier game — that one’s on Fantasia Games (my mistake). But in the process, we dug deeper and found another campaign that was theirs: The Sixth Realm.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween that and Merchants Cove: Master Craft, Final Frontier raised a combined total of $1.1 million from backers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis changes nothing . They took the money and left people high and dry.\n\nThe correction has been made. If you think that undercuts any points in this post, you’ve got bigger issues than a campaign title.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Industry Is Burning. And the Arsonists Are Playing Victim.\n\nThis week, the board game world caught fire.\n\nFinal Frontier Games—a company backed by millions—announced it’s shutting down.\n\nCephalofair—the multi-million-dollar juggernaut behind Gloomhaven—went on CNN to say they’ve been paralyzed by tariffs.\n\nOne blamed distributors. The other blamed Trump.\n\nAnd the rest of the industry?\n\nThey’re echoing the same line: “There was nothing we could do.”\n\nBut here’s the truth nobody wants to hear (but I keep saying it anyway):\n\nThey’re not victims of tariffs. They’re victims of their own incompetence.\n\nAnd I’m not saying that lightly.\n\nI’m saying that as someone who’s built a game company from scratch.\n\nSomeone who’s eaten shipping losses.\n\nSomeone who’s hand-packed thousands of units just to keep promises.\n\nAnd someone who actually bothered to look up the tariff codes before screaming into the void.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve already written two blogs debunking this nonsense.\n\nBut apparently facts aren’t sexy until someone lights a $4 million fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo fine.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s talk about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s talk about the publishers who raised millions and still managed to crash their own ships.\n\nLet’s talk about the freight forwarders filing lazy paperwork that nuked budgets overnight.\n\nLet’s talk about the false narratives being fed to backers while inventory rots in warehouses—fully paid for by the very people being told “we can’t afford to ship your game.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t a tragedy.\n\nIt’s a masterclass in bad business.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd today?\n\nWe’re naming names.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrap in. Some reputations aren’t making it out of this blog alive.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Frontier: Dead Before Arrival\n\nFinal Frontier Games is dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while their farewell message is soaked in tears and poetic heartbreak, let’s be honest—it wasn’t fate that killed them. It was failure. Avoidable, preventable, self-inflicted failure.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn their final Kickstarter update, Final Frontier announced that they were shutting down operations, leaving Merchants Cove: Master Craft and The Sixth Realm backers out to dry. The tone was predictably solemn. The messaging? A masterclass in buck-passing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey blamed CMON.\n\nThey blamed the distributors.\n\nThey blamed the economy.\n\nThey blamed “unexpected circumstances.”\n\nThey (kinda) blamed GameTrayz\n\nThey blamed everyone but the people responsible:\n\nthemselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, they apologized. Yes, they claimed sorrow. But what they didn’t do—not once—was truly own the decisions that led to their collapse. This wasn't a postmortem. It was a eulogy. A soft, sad letter to the fans about how the world did them dirty.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey said, “We are truly sorry we won’t be able to make good on the promise we made to you.”\n\nThey said, “Words cannot express how sorry we feel for this.”\n\nBut what they really meant was: “We’re sorry this happened to us.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThey Were the Victim in Their Own Story\n\nRead the update yourself . You’ll see a tale of noble sacrifice:\n\nThey absorbed $250,000 in pandemic shipping costs\n\nThey funded their own localizations to keep promises to backers\n\nThey dipped into funds from other projects to cover shortfalls\n\nThey cut themselves thin to honor their vision and their fans\n\n\n\nAdmirable? Sure. And relatable—I did the same with High Noon and it damn near killed us too.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut here’s the thing:\n\nPast nobility doesn’t excuse present neglect.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey present themselves like war heroes who were overwhelmed by forces beyond their control. But the truth is, they kept making the same foundational mistakes over and over again—and when it finally caught up with them, they wrapped it in a tragic tone and hoped we'd accept “sorry” as a substitute for accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s Talk About CMON\n\nThe “final nail in the coffin,” according to them, was a massive Chinese-language order from CMON that was never paid for. The order went into production anyway, on blind faith alone.\n\nNow let me be clear:\n\nThere is no amount of money CMON could offer me that would make me work with them.\n\nNone.\n\n\n\n\n\nCMON has a well-documented history of:\n\nFailing to deliver to customers\n\nSurprise-gouging backers with last-minute shipping hikes\n\nRefusing to own up to delays and screwups\n\nActing with arrogant impunity because they know people will keep paying\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople have openly speculated that CMON runs like a Ponzi scheme. And honestly? I see why.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does Final Frontier do?\n\nThey trust CMON with a massive production run without a single dime up front.\n\nThey banked their entire future on the shadiest company in the industry—and they lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not bad luck. That’s bad leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Distributor Debacle\n\nNext excuse: “Distributors backed out after orders were placed.”\n\nLet me translate that for you:\n\n“We greenlit thousands of units based on non-binding promises from people who didn’t give us any money.”\n\nWhat kind of business does that?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re operating a company where a canceled PO can bankrupt you, you don’t start production without a deposit. Ever.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery factory in the world understands this. Every business that’s ever survived understands this.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut not Final Frontier.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey just hit “go” on production and hoped that the promises would turn into payments.\n\nSpoiler alert: They didn’t.\n\nWhen you gamble your backers’ money on handshake deals with no collateral, you’re not a victim of bad luck. You’re a volunteer for disaster.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Games Exist. The Backers Still Won’t Get Them.\n\nThis is the part that burns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Frontier admits the games are in warehouses—right now.\n\nWarehouses are liquidating retail inventory to cover costs.\n\nThe backers, the ones who paid for those games, will get nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey don’t say, “We’re fighting to get your product into your hands.”\n\nThey say, “We hope we’ll find someone to buy the IP and figure it out.”\n\nNo plan. No commitment. No fire in their gut.\n\nJust tears. And the expectation that their “emotional devastation” is enough.\n\nIf my product was being held hostage in a warehouse while my backers waited? I’d be at the loading dock with a crowbar and a bodycam, not a violin and a candle.\n\nThey’re just walking away.\n\nNo fire. No fight. Just a quiet shrug and the expectation that we’ll forgive them because, hey, “we tried.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Self-Aggrandizement Mask\n\nThe whole second half of their update is a parade of “look how much we cared.”\n\nThey tell you about the 10 families who lost their jobs.\n\nAbout the hopes and dreams crushed by cruel fate.\n\nAbout how they were building “a lifetime relationship” with their backers.\n\nThey even ask you—no joke—not to lash out because they’re hurting too.\n\nThat’s not transparency. That’s weaponized vulnerability. It’s emotional blackmail disguised as community. It's gross.\n\nYou don’t get to throw a bomb into your fulfillment chain and then beg your customers not to yell because you’re sad about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ponzi Echo\n\nThey admit to dipping into funds from one project to pay for another.\n\nThey admit to letting timelines slip across multiple campaigns.\n\nThey admit that their entire infrastructure depended on CMON’s check clearing on time.\n\nI’m not accusing them of fraud.\n\nBut I will say this:\n\nIf your company collapses the moment one check bounces, you weren’t running a business. You were running a house of cards.\n\nThe Final Frontier: Destination Delusion\n\nI don’t take joy in any of this.\n\nI know what it’s like to grind through shipping disasters, absorb costs, and stretch yourself paper-thin to keep promises.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut at some point, your passion has to mature into discipline.\n\nAnd when it doesn’t, your failure becomes contagious.\n\nThis is why backers are skeptical.\n\nThis is why Kickstarter trust is evaporating.\n\nThis is why other publishers are left cleaning up the mess.\n\nBecause companies like Final Frontier burn to the ground the goodwill that the rest of us are trying to build.\n\nAnd the most dangerous part? They still think they were the good guys.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving on...\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Last Time I’m Going to Talk About Tariffs\n\nI wasn’t planning on writing this.\n\nNot again. I’ve already written about tariffs—twice.\n\nThe first time was when the industry panic level hit “54%.”\n\nThe second time was when it climbed to “102%.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this week, things went mainstream.\n\nThe meltdown got camera time. CNN time.\n\nAnd now this misinformation is being broadcast to millions of people who wouldn’t know a Harmonized Tariff Schedule from a player aid.\n\nSo this is it. The last time I’ll talk about tariffs.\n\nBecause when this is done, you won’t need anyone to talk about them again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Truth About Tariffs (For Real This Time)\n\nLet’s kill the myth once and for all:\n\nYou are not paying 145%. You are not paying 245%. You are not even paying 25%—unless you screw it up.\n\nThe board game industry is in full-blown panic mode over tariffs.\n\nCNN's talking about it.\n\nKickstarter updates are talking about it.\n\nDiscord groups are talking about it.\n\nRetailers are paralyzed.\n\nPublishers are “freezing operations.”\n\nAnd everyone is shouting one number: 245%.\n\nIt’s everywhere—except the actual tariff schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\nMFN Status: The Reason You’re Not Already Paying 145%\n\nMost people screaming about tariffs don’t realize their board games are protected by something called Most-Favored Nation (MFN) status. Most publishers don’t even know what an MFN tariff rate is—let alone why it matters.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the deal:\n\nMFN status means a country (like China) is still considered a “friendly” trade partner under WTO rules.\n\nProducts under MFN codes (like board games) don’t get hit with retaliatory “reciprocal” tariffs , because there’s nothing to reciprocate.\n\nBut if your freight forwarder files your shipment under something like 9503—miscellaneous toys (hello, puzzles and dolls), you’re toast.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause China raised their tariffs on U.S. toys under 9503. And under the reciprocal tariff framework, the U.S. slapped 125% right back on that code.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now your shipment is flagged as a trade war casualty—not because of what’s in the box, but because someone put the wrong number on the form.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou didn’t get hit with 245% tariffs. You misfiled your HTS code.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the part nobody’s talking about. This is why some publishers are screaming about 145–245% while others are shrugging and moving games like normal.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not policy. It’s paperwork.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Real Tariff Numbers (When You Do It Right)\n\nIf you ship a complete board game—cards, minis, rulebook, dice, tray, and box—shrink-wrapped and ready to go, you classify it under:\n\nHTS Code 9504.90.6000 – “Articles for arcade, table, or parlor games” Old Tariff Rate: 0% New (IEEPA) Rate: 20%\n\nYes, the IEEPA law dropped a blanket 20% duty on nearly every product coming out of China. That includes board games—even if they were previously exempt.\n\nBut that’s it.\n\nTwenty percent. Not 145. Not 245.\n\nIt’s annoying. It’s sudden. But it’s manageable.\n\nAnd more importantly?\n\nIt’s not your only option.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Want Transparency? Here’s the Whole Box.\n\nBut let’s paint a clearer picture of what’s actually inside that box — and what each part really costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause if you want to talk about board games, let’s talk about the whole board game:\n\nCards. Dice. Minis. Rulebooks. Punchboards. Boxes. Inserts.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the breakdown of the actual HTS codes and their current tariff rates under the IEEPA update:\n\nComponent HTS Code Tariff Cards 9504.40.0000 20% Rulebook 4901.99.00 20% Punchboards 9504.90.6000 20% Dice 9504.90.60.00 20% Plastic Minis 9504.90.6000 20% Paper Boxes 4819 25% Plastic Inserts 3926 20%\n\nWant to fact-check this yourself?\n\nYou can look up any HTS code and its tariff rate directly at the official U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule: https://hts.usitc.gov\n\nJust type in the HTS code and hit enter.\n\nIgnore Column 2 — it doesn’t apply to China. That rate is for countries the U.S. has no trade agreement with, like North Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen shipping a complete, assembled game, the final effective tariff is ~21%—based on each component’s classification under its respective HTS code.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot 245%.\n\nNot 145%.\n\nAnd definitely not the end of the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust enough to sting if you’re lazy.\n\nBut not enough to blame for a business collapse.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it a silver bullet? No.\n\nIs it better than being scalped by lazy freight forwarders and paralyzed by misinformation? Every damn time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Real Scandal\n\nWant to know why the industry keeps yelling “245%”?\n\nBecause most publishers don’t know their own codes.\n\nThey rely on freight forwarders who just plug in whatever HTS code gets the shipment cleared fastest—even if it’s completely wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of them are getting hit with 145%+ rates not because the law changed, but because they never checked their own paperwork.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey’re not victims of policy.\n\nThey’re victims of their own ignorance.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now they’re taking that bad info and spreading it like wildfire.\n\nBackers are scared. Retailers are scared.\n\nAnd the narrative has been hijacked by people who never ran a shipping manifest in their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd freight forwarders?\n\nOh, they’re the silent chaos agents in all of this.\n\nThese guys will slap “miscellaneous toys” on your shipment like a cat knocking your glass off the table—not because they’re malicious, but because it’s faster and they just don’t care.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick click, submit, done.\n\n245% tariff? Not their problem.\n\nPublisher meltdown?\n\nNot their problem.\n\nCNN interview?\n\nDefinitely not their problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst part? Nobody’s holding them accountable.\n\nThese are the people triggering industry-wide panic by misclassifying your entire business into the “oops” bin—and you’re just paying the invoice like it’s gospel.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your freight forwarder can’t quote you the exact HTS code they’re using—and why—they shouldn’t be anywhere near your shipment.\n\nThey’re not logistics partners.\n\nThey’re random dudes with access to your bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Advice?\n\nIf you're a publisher:\n\nStop outsourcing your HTS codes.\n\nGrow up.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're a backer:\n\nAsk your publisher if they know what HTS code their game is classified under.\n\nIf they can't answer you, they shouldn't be handling millions of your dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're a freight forwarder marking everything as \"other toys\" at 9503.00.0090:\n\nYou're the reason this panic exists.\n\nStop it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCephalofair’s $4 Million Tariff Lie Just Fell Apart\n\nWhile Final Frontier was crashing and blaming the weather, Cephalofair was suiting up for prime time.\n\nLiterally.\n\nThey sent their COO, Price Johnson to CNN to cry about being crushed by $4 million in tariffs for 60,000 units of Gloomhaven: Second Edition.\n\nThe story?\n\nThat the tariffs made it “impossible” to import those copies into the U.S.\n\nThe villain?\n\nDonald Trump.\n\nAnd the number they floated—$4.14 million—wasn’t broken down, wasn’t explained, and wasn’t accompanied by a single receipt. It was just stated as fact. And CNN ran with it. No questions asked.\n\nBut we asked questions.\n\nAnd we ran the receipts.\n\nAnd what we found destroys the entire narrative.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the interview, point by point. You can watch it on Price's Facebook page .\n\n\n\n\n\nDebunking This CNN Interview: Piece by Piece\n\n1. “We started production before we had any idea what the tariffs would be.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s either a lie or a confession of gross negligence.\n\nThe U.S. began issuing Section 301 tariffs against Chinese goods in 2018. By 2019, board games were already at risk of a 25% tariff spike—on top of existing 0–11.2% baseline tariffs. This was publicly known and discussed in the industry.\n\nSo no, Price. You didn’t get blindsided. You ignored a moving train and then cried when it hit you.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. “We’ve got $1.2 million of product stuck overseas—60,000 units—and we’re being told we’ll have to pay a 145% tariff to get it in.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the heart of the grift.\n\nWe’ve already proven—with actual HTS codes—that a board game like Gloomhaven should incur: 20%\n\nReal average tariff: $5 per game (rounded up estimate) Real tariff total for 60,000 units: $300,000 Not $2.94 million. Not even close.\n\nSo if they’re getting slapped with 145% or more, it’s because someone on their team filed the classification wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not a tariff crisis. That’s a user error.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. “We’ve essentially been told to cease U.S. sales.”\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s get this straight.\n\nHe’s not saying they can’t operate globally. He’s saying they can’t sell in the U.S.—specifically through their retail distribution pipeline.\n\nYou know what that tells me?\n\nThey don’t have a direct-to-consumer strategy.\n\nThat’s not a tariff issue. That’s a business model failure.\n\nInstead of pivoting to DTC:\n\nInstead of spinning up Shopify and running Facebook ads\n\nInstead of leveraging email lists and running preorder campaigns\n\nInstead of importing only the units they owed to backers\n\nInstead of warehousing the rest overseas and waiting it out\n\n\n\n\n\nThey just shut it all down.\n\nThat’s not leadership. That’s cowardice.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. “Our last major project shipped 140 ocean containers from China.”\n\n...Wait.\n\nHold up.\n\nLet’s do the math.\n\nA standard 40-foot ocean container holds about 2,385 cubic feet of usable space.\n\nEven padded and palletized, a Gloomhaven-sized box takes up around 1 cubic foot.\n\nSo let’s say you can fit ~2,300 units per container.\n\nThat means 140 containers = ~322,000 units.\n\nAt their own stated production cost of $20 per unit, that’s $6.4 million in manufacturing costs . At $150 MSRP? That’s $48 million in potential retail value.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is the same company now claiming they can’t afford a $300,000 tariff hit?\n\nEven if we give them the ridiculous benefit of the doubt and fantastically assume double the case size for whatever reason, that still puts them well over 150,000–160,000 units shipped in one wave. That’s still $2–3 million in production and $20–25 million in retail value.\n\nI literally can't, even.\n\nSo the question stands: Where did all that money go?\n\nYou don’t ship $19 million in games and then cry poor six months later— unless your business model is catastrophically broken. And you want the public to forget that backers paid for the whole production run.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s Call It What It Is\n\nThis isn’t a story about tariffs.\n\nThis isn’t about U.S. manufacturing.\n\nThis isn’t even about politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is about a publisher who:\n\nFailed to adapt\n\nOverproduced inventory for a distribution model that’s dying\n\nGot caught without a plan B\n\nAnd is now spinning a victim narrative to cover up their own arrogance\n\n\n\n\n\nYou want the truth?\n\nBackers bankrolled your future inventory. You were sitting on a goldmine. You just didn’t know how to sell it.\n\nThat’s not a tariff issue.\n\nThat’s a you issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore he ever went on CNN, Price Johnson posted a public statement on Cephalofair’s blog to justify the panic. And after reading it, the picture becomes crystal clear.\n\nPrice’s article doesn’t include a single HTS code. It doesn’t cite a single invoice. It doesn’t even try to explore alternatives.\n\nIt’s not a breakdown. It’s a smokescreen. A slow, emotional setup for the media frenzy that followed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s what you need to know:\n\nHe cites a timeline of tariffs jumping from 0% to 104%, without ever confirming what codes those tariffs actually apply to.\n\nHe claims this “blanket policy” applies to all board games , but never names the actual HTS classifications that would prove it.\n\nHe says the industry can’t pivot, can’t adapt, and has no options.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of this—all of it—was published before the CNN piece aired.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it’s the exact same language he used in the interview.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo no, CNN didn’t dig into this story. They didn’t do an exposé.\n\nThey ran the script Cephalofair handed them—and never asked for a receipt.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Cephalofair: Let’s Be Generous and Take Their Numbers\n\nCephalofair claims it cost them $20 per unit to produce Gloomhaven 2nd Edition. It doesn't. It's about half that, unless they're getting scalped. But okay, fine. Whatever.\n\n60,000 units × $20 = $1.2 million in production costs\n\n\n\nThey also claim that new tariffs would apply a 245% tax on top of that cost—so:\n\n$20 × 2.45 = $49 in tariffs per unit\n\n60,000 units × $49 = $2.94 million in tariffs\n\n\n\n\n\nSo their claimed total to import the games is:\n\n$1.2M (production) + $2.94M (tariffs) = $4.14 million\n\nThat’s the number that made headlines.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Here’s the Problem: That Tariff Rate Is Fiction\n\nCephalofair’s $4 million panic hinges on the idea that they’re being charged a 245% tariff.\n\nThey're not.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe already broke down the real tariff rates earlier—and unless you or your freight forwarder are asleep at the wheel, board games don’t get anywhere near that number. Even after the IEEPA update, if you ship the full game as-is under the correct code, the average tariff is 20%, with some components like packaging slightly higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo let’s redo the math using their own numbers and the actual tariff rate:\n\nProduction: $1.2 million\n\nTariffs (20%): $240,000\n\nShipping (3 containers @ $15K): $45,000\n\nTotal Landed Cost: $1.485 million\n\n\n\n\n\nNot $4.14 million.\n\n$1.48 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd That’s Not Even the Worst of It\n\nLet’s talk about where this $1.2 million came from.\n\nBecause Cephalofair ran the Gloomhaven: Grand Festival on BackerKit—and raised over $5 million. That campaign included:\n\nGloomhaven: Second Edition\n\nGloomhaven RPG\n\nMiniatures and terrain\n\nOrganizers, books, and more\n\n\n\nSo let’s be fair—maybe only $1.5–$2 million of that total was from Gloomhaven 2.0 itself.\n\nThat’s still enough to fully fund production of all 60,000 units.\n\nMeaning: Backers paid for the entire production run.\n\nSo what’s sitting in that overseas warehouse right now?\n\nFree product.\n\nFully funded by backers.\n\nUnsold inventory—printed on spec—ready to be sold at 100% profit margin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey Didn’t Just Produce for Backers. They Overproduced for Retail\n\nIf you only had 10,000–15,000 backers for Gloomhaven: Second Edition, why print 60,000 units?\n\nBecause they were planning to sell the rest at retail.\n\nProbably to distributors.\n\nMaybe to big box stores.\n\nProbably to Target.\n\nBut the key here is: the backers didn’t just pay for their own games.\n\nThey bankrolled Cephalofair’s entire retail inventory.\n\nAnd now that plan is stuck in limbo.\n\nNot because of tariffs. Because they printed 45,000 extra units on speculation without a fulfillment plan or tariff strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Could They Have Done Instead?\n\nThey could have:\n\nShipped only the 10–15k backer copies to the U.S.\n\nStored the rest in their overseas warehouse, and chill.\n\nImported in small waves, or shipped regionally to other markets\n\nWaited out the tariff situation while keeping their promises\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead?\n\nThey went on national television and blamed the president.\n\nThey framed it as a political tragedy.\n\nAnd they pretended they were the victims of a situation they created through arrogance and bad planning.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Let’s Not Forget Frosthaven\n\nThis is the same publisher that raised $13 million for Frosthaven.\n\nEven using their own bloated $20/unit figure, 83,193 backers × $20 = $1.66 million in production.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd in generous shipping/logistics and call it $2 million total cost.\n\nThat leaves:\n\n$11 million in capital.\n\nEleven million.\n\nThey had every opportunity to build out infrastructure, bring in experienced operators, plan for fulfillment risks, or diversify production.\n\nThey didn’t.\n\nAnd now they want the public to foot the sympathy bill while they sit on unsold inventory that the backers paid for.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t a tragedy. It’s a grift.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you don’t like that word, fine. Call it what it really is:\n\nAn epic failure of leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Why Do I Keep Hearing This If It’s Not True?\n\nThat’s the question, isn’t it?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf what I’ve laid out here is true—if board games aren’t subject to +145% tariffs (or whatever made up number the hysteria brigade wants to drum up this week), if the real rates are closer to 20%, if there are clear ways around this entire mess—then why is the entire industry saying otherwise?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is everyone from Kickstarter publishers to CNN anchors repeating the same doom and gloom like it’s gospel?\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the uncomfortable answer:\n\nBecause this industry isn’t built on business. It’s built on hobbyists.\n\nHobbyists don’t know how to vet freight classifications.\n\nThey don’t know what HTS codes are.\n\nThey don’t ask.\n\nAnd they don’t check.\n\nThey trust that their freight forwarder is doing it right.\n\nThey get an invoice. They pay it.\n\nAnd if that invoice says, “your tariff is 245%”—they believe it.\n\nBecause they’re not businesspeople.\n\nThey’re gamers who got a little lucky on Kickstarter.\n\nAnd now they’re stuck playing a game they were never trained to win.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Perfect Storm for Getting Screwed\n\nLet me spell it out:\n\nThe U.S. declares a 245% tariff—not on board games, but on a catch-all category that looks close enough on paper.\n\nChina-based freight forwarders—who owe you no loyalty, especially in a trade war—now have an excuse to apply that rate.\n\nYou don’t know the codes.\n\nYou don’t question the paperwork.\n\nYou assume the government is the villain.\n\n\n\nAnd just like that, you're overpaying thousands, and you don’t even know it.\n\nBecause the people who could tell you the truth—don’t.\n\nAnd the people who would tell you the truth—get banned from board game groups and cancelled from the industry for wrongthink.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s Not a Conspiracy. It’s Just the Cost of Ignorance.\n\nDo I know for certain that freight forwarders are deliberately overcharging publishers?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I know they’ve done it in other industries.\n\nI know it’s profitable.\n\nI know it’s hard to trace unless you audit your customs entries.\n\nAnd I know the people getting hit the hardest are the ones least likely to do that.\n\nAnd worst of all?\n\nThey’re too naïve to know where the knife came from. And too proud to admit they let it in.\n\nThis is the last time I’ll talk about tariffs.\n\nNot because they’re unimportant, but because we’ve exposed them completely.\n\nIf you’re still confused after this, it’s not because the truth isn’t out there. It’s because you’ve chosen not to look.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow go back and read the Cephalofair section again.\n\nAnd this time, read it like someone who knows the rules of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of rules…\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, you already know what kind of industry we’re in.\n\nIt’s volatile. It’s unforgiving. And it doesn’t care how many backers you had if you don’t know how to run a business.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s why I wrote Game Changer.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot to vent. Not to gloat.\n\nBut to hand over the playbook I wish someone had given me before I learned everything the hard way.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not fluff.\n\nIt’s not a feel-good story.\n\nIt’s a field manual—built from the trenches of real campaigns, real fulfillment, real logistics, and real accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re tired of being lied to...\n\nIf you’re done watching multimillion-dollar publishers trip over the basics...\n\nAnd if you’re ready to build something that actually lasts—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause surviving in this industry isn’t luck.\n\nIt’s discipline.\n\nIt’s strategy.\n\nAnd it’s knowing the rules of the game better than the guy next to you."}

But without security patches, the continued use of Windows 10 as the main operating system will pose many risks. However, running Windows 10 as a virtual machine (aka VM) is a safer alternative. The separation of the virtual system and the real system reduces potential threats.\n\nHow to turn Windows 10 into a VM\n\nWith Disk2Vhd, you can convert Windows 10 into a virtual system without much prior knowledge. The advantage of the freeware is that it’s started directly in the Windows installation to be virtualized. The tool writes the existing Windows system to a virtual hard drive in VHD or VHDX format. You can then boot the virtual disc in Windows 11 with Virtualbox or Hyper-V as a virtual machine in the window.\n\nUse the free Disk2vhd to convert a physical data carrier into a virtual hard disk file. Use the tool to move a Windows 10 installation to a virtual machine. IDG\n\nDownload Disk2vhd and unzip the file into an empty folder on your hard drive. Start the program by double-clicking on “disk2vhd64.exe” if you are using the 64-bit version of Windows 10 on the system to be converted.\n\nFor Windows 10 with 32-bit, double-click on “disk2vhd.exe”. Disk2vhd displays an overview of all recognized hard drive partitions.\n\nA tick is placed in front of each partition, it is best to accept all the ticks on the system hard drive. If the system has more than one hard drive, you can remove the tick(s) in front of the partitions on the second hard drive.\n\nCreate VHD or VHDX?\n\nThe “Use VHDX” option for the VDHX target format is activated by default–this is ideal if you want to use the virtual hard disk later with Hyper-V.\n\nIf you want to boot the guest PC with Windows 10 in Virtualbox, remove the tick in front of “Use VHDX.” Disk2vhd then creates the target file in VDH format, which Virtualbox supports directly. Next, click on the three-dot button after “VHD file name” and specify the storage location for the target file.\n\nMake sure you also enable the “Use Volume Shadow Copy” option, then click “Create” to start the conversion. Once complete, you’ll see the following confirmation message: “Disk Export to VHD completed successfully.”\n\nAn older Windows 10 can also continue to be used as a virtual machine under Windows 11 or Linux. You have the choice of converting the existing installation or setting up the VM again. IDG\n\nCopy the hard drive file created with Disk2vhd to the target computer you want to start Windows 10 on. You can also boot directly from an external hard drive.\n\nBooting the Windows 10 image\n\nTo start the previously backed up Windows 10 in the window, create a new virtual machine in Hyper-V or Virtualbox, and select “Windows 10” as the operating system. Don’t create a new virtual hard drive, but instead integrate the backup file of your Windows 10 system. In Hyper-V, go to “Use an existing virtual hard disk,” and then (in Virtualbox) navigate to “Use an existing virtual hard disk file.” You can now start your Windows 10 PC.\n\nThere’s no guarantee that a Windows 10 installation that has been converted with Disk2vhd will run as desired under Hyper-V or Virtualbox. If the guest PC does not start correctly, convert the hard drive again as a test and adjust the partition selection.\n\nReinstalling Windows 10\n\nReinstalling Windows 10 (including your programs) in a virtual machine takes more time, but it has its advantages. A freshly installed system generally runs faster and it usually removes the junk data that had accumulated over the years.\n\nBy default, the Media Creation Tool for Windows 10 downloads the ISO file for the system on which you run the tool. To get more choice, deactivate the checkbox next to “Use recommended options for this PC”. IDG\n\nFor the new installation of Windows 10, you need an installation medium like the Windows DVD or Windows ISO file, and the license key (Windows Key). If you don’t have an installation DVD to hand, use the free Media Creation Tool for Windows 10 from Microsoft to download the appropriate ISO image file.\n\nStart the tool. Now click “Accept,” “Select,” “Create installation media (USB memory stick, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC,” and then “Next.” If the suggested Windows version is suitable, click “Next,” otherwise remove the tick from “Use recommended options for this PC,” and select the version. Tick the “ISO file,” select “Next,” and enter a name for the ISO file. Click “Save” to start the download.\n\nCreate a VM for Windows 10\n\nInstalling Windows 10 as a guest operating system in Virtualbox is the same as setting up a VM with Windows 10. Set the “Type” for the virtual machine to “Windows 10 (64-bit)” for the 64-bit version of Windows 10 or “Windows 10 (32-bit)” for the 32-bit version, depending on your installation medium.\n\nAt least 4GB of virtual memory is recommended. As the installation medium, either select the drive containing the Windows DVD or specify the ISO installation file. After installing Windows 10 as the operating system, next install the programs you want to work with. If you’re using Windows 10 under Virtualbox, install the guest extensions via “Devices” and “Insert guest extensions.”\n\nNext, create a backup point. This allows you to return to your freshly installed Windows 10 system at any time."}

Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nAiper makes some excellent robotic pool cleanrs—such as its stellar workhorse, the Seagull Pro—but it also has a few duds in its arsenal, including the Seagull Plus and the Scuba S1. With its latest robot, the Scuba X1, Aiper looks to bring some higher-end features (including smart connectivity) to the lineup. With a street price of $1,200, it’s one of Aiper’s most expensive models–and it’s got the gold trim to prove it.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe Aiper Scuba X1 doesn’t change the basic design that most of Aiper’s full-size robots have followed for years: Compare its design to the aforementioned Seagull Pro, Seagull Plus, and Scuba S1. The 24-pound Scuba X1 runs on two treads that sandwich two front-mounted cylindrical brushes that do the heavy lifting; rather, the heavy scrubbing. All black with the aforementioned gold accents, the design is sleek and orca-like. If nothing else it certainly looks the part of a $1,000-plus pool robot.\n\nThe MicroMesh system in the Aiper Scuba X1’s debris basket is effective at capturing fine-grained grime.\n\nThe unit includes a 7800mAh battery that Aiper says should provide a running time of three hours and supports a maximum pool size of 2,150 square feet. A single onboard button lets you power up the robot and choose an operating mode: “smart mode” (floors and walls), floor only, walls only, or waterline only (where the robot moves vertically along the pool wall to scrub the tile).\n\nAiper’s MicroMesh filter is a piece of fabric that wraps around an interior filter box. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nAn additional mode, “scheduled,” is only available in the Aiper app and commands the robot to run for 50 minutes, cleaning the floor only, once every 48 hours, until its battery dies. A large LED bar on the top of the robot indicates when it is charging (pulsing red, blue, or green, depending on charge level), ready to run (solid green), or finished operating (solid red), along with usage for various error modes.\n\nThe unit is charged via a convenient docking station that connects to wall power and eliminates the need to manually plug the robot in after each run. The dock is simple to snap together out of the box, without any tools required.\n\nThe filter basket requires special attention because of its three-piece design. A traditional outer basket collects larger debris, while a “MicroMesh ultra-fine filter” picks up smaller morsels of dirt and sand. The MicroMesh filter is a piece of fabric that wraps around an interior filter box, which doesn’t do anything except hold the MicroMesh in place. All three pieces are sandwiched together when installed; I’ll talk about the effectiveness of this setup in a bit.\n\nPerformance\n\nAiper’s MicroMesh filter is effective at trapping particulate matter, but it’s a major pain to clean. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nAs with nearly all robotic pool cleaners, the Scuba X1 is activated by placing it on flat ground, powering it up, selecting an operating mode, and dropping it into the pool. In the standard smart mode, it first cleans the walls, then moves to the floor, moving relatively methodically and slowly as it sweeps back and forth. The unit does spend a long while idling on the pool floor whenever it needs to make a turn, apparently trying to figure out its next move, before it gets going again.\n\nIn my pool, I never got more than 2.5 hours of running time out of the robot, compared to the 3 hours Aiper specifies. The bigger issue, however, is that the robot missed quite a bit of material during its runs in my pool. On average, it collected only about 90 percent of test debris, whether organic or synthetic, leaving behind leaves on the bottom of the pool. That’s quite a poor showing for a robot in this price range, and arguably the unit’s biggest shortcoming.\n\nThe Aiper Scuba X1’s charging dock plugs into an outdoor outlet, so you don’t need to drag any cords to the robotic pool cleaner itself. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nA close second, however, is cleanup. While the MicroMesh system is effective at capturing fine-grained grime, it is a massive pain to clean. First, the mesh filter must be detached from the interior filter box, which is a challenge when it’s dry and a huge hassle when it’s wet and dirty.\n\nDisconnecting the various clips and tabs that hold the filter in place is a chore even before you set about cleaning it. A hose doesn’t do the trick; I regularly needed to use a scrub brush to get the filter mostly free from debris, all of which meant a considerable amount of effort and making quite a mess to boot. I’ve never spent so much time emptying a filter basket, which is not what I expect from device in this price range.\n\nThis review is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best robotic pool cleaners.\n\nRetrieving the bot after its cleaning mission is also a chore: While the robot can climb walls, it can’t pull itself out of the pool when quitting time comes, unlike some competitors at this price level. The Scuba X1 was at least successful at docking itself near the wall when complete, but you’ll need to use the included hook and a pole to lift it from the water.\n\nAiper’s mobile app doesn’t do much of anything that you can’t accomplish just as easily by pushing buttons on the Scuba X1 itself. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nAiper’s app is for the most part superfluous. After a quick and easy Bluetooth-based setup, you’ll find that the app can’t really do anything except choose the operating mode, which (except for the scheduled mode) you can do via the single button on the unit. The sole additional feature is a basic log of operational activity and running time, which is only of minimal use. As with most robots, the app won’t connect to the device while the unit is in the water due to interference issues.\n\nShould you buy an Aiper Scuba X1?\n\nIf it had a price of $500, the Aiper Scuba X1 might be an acceptable lower-cost pool robot solution, but it just doesn’t do a good enough job cleaning to merit buying it at its full price of $1,200.\n\nThe hassle involved with cleaning the filter basket only makes things more frustrating, and the value proposition even less compelling."}

Captain Virgil van Dijk confirmed that the squad is planning a group viewing of Arsenal’s crucial clash with Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium.\n\n“I expect Arsenal to win at home,” Van Dijk stated, “but, yeah, if it doesn’t happen then I think…” — a trailing sentence that says more in ellipsis than any emphatic declaration. The anticipation in his voice betrays the calm exterior. This is a club on the brink of history once again.\n\nEchoes of 2020 as History Repeats\n\nIt’s hard not to draw parallels with 2020, when Liverpool’s long-awaited title triumph arrived in equally passive fashion — watching Chelsea beat Manchester City from the comfort of Formby Hall Hotel. This time, the venue may differ, but the setup remains the same: a close-knit group of players and staff, unified by the culmination of a season’s effort.\n\nPaul Joyce of The Times captures it perfectly, highlighting the symbolic symmetry. This isn’t just a team that wins titles — it’s one that shares the moment, regardless of where it happens. Whether on a pitch in Leicester or a lounge in Liverpool, it’s the togetherness that tells the story.\n\nThe Slot Effect Already Visible\n\nArne Slot, Klopp’s successor, has yet to be fully embraced by some sections of the media — perhaps a symptom of succeeding a legend. Yet the mood in the camp and the cohesion displayed suggest he’s found instant traction. Sunday’s emphatic away win at Leicester underscored not just Liverpool’s tactical clarity but their emotional momentum.\n\nPhotographs of Van Dijk embracing Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah and Slot post-match encapsulate the unity. This is not a team in transition — it’s a team that has transitioned, and done so with breathtaking ease.\n\nPalace the Wild Card?\n\nAs for Arsenal, their task on Wednesday is theoretically simple. But Paul Joyce rightly notes that Crystal Palace have an FA Cup semi-final looming against Aston Villa — and that could result in a rotated squad. It adds a layer of unpredictability. Would Oliver Glasner dare rest Eberechi Eze or Michael Olise against the league’s most in-form side?\n\nLiverpool, of course, can only control what they do. And they’ve done that exceptionally. A get-together for a potential title decider shows maturity, but also emotional readiness. It’s not hope — it’s preparation. Van Dijk, as ever, is the embodiment of this approach: focused, unflappable, quietly relishing the weight of the moment.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThis isn’t just another title. This feels sweeter, almost more profound — because of how Liverpool have responded to the post-Klopp question. Arne Slot has galvanised this squad, and that speaks volumes.\n\nVan Dijk’s leadership has been immense. “I expect Arsenal to win,” he said, but that confidence isn’t arrogance — it’s football realism. Even if Palace somehow defy expectations, Liverpool know they are only ever 90 minutes from the trophy. The pressure is, for once, not theirs.\n\nBut imagine it — the entire squad together, the TV flickering, a Palace counterattack, the Emirates silenced. In that moment, the title would be Liverpool’s. No final whistle needed at Anfield or away. Just shared glances, shouts of joy, champagne spraying in a private room.\n\nThis isn’t about waiting for someone else to hand you the trophy. It’s about recognising the journey. From the heartbreak of last-minute slips, to missing out with 97 points, to the pandemic-era triumph, and now to this… Liverpool have mastered the long game. And their reward may come not with a roar, but with a collective breath held in front of a screen.\n\nAs fans, we’ll be holding our breath too.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThis is exactly what we live for. Honestly, if you’d told us last May, with Klopp on his farewell tour and Slot just a whisper, that we’d be sat top the next April — potentially champions without even playing — we wouldn’t have believed you. But now? Now it feels like fate.\n\nThe idea of the lads sitting together, watching the Arsenal game, waiting for that final whistle like it’s a Champions League final… there’s something beautifully poetic about it. That unity — it’s what’s made this team so special, even with a new face in the dugout. Slot’s clearly earned their respect, and probably the fans’ too.\n\nVan Dijk’s quote about expecting Arsenal to win is classic big Virgil — measured, grounded, but not ruling anything out. And that’s how we feel. Let Arsenal do their thing. We’ll be ready. We are ready. Whether the title comes from a Palace upset or on our own terms next weekend — this team deserves it. And we’ll celebrate either way.\n\nRoll on Wednesday night.\n\nUp the Reds."}

He wasn’t dreaming of Madrid. He was dreaming of Anfield. Of Kenny, Stevie, the roar of the Kop. He wasn’t plotting exit clauses or projecting image rights. He was, simply, Liverpool.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold should have been the one who wrote his name into folklore so deeply that grandfathers would speak it in the same breath as Dalglish and Gerrard. That should have been the arc. The fairytale. The path he carved not just with outrageous talent but with a Scouser’s soul — a local lad from West Derby made good.\n\nInstead, here we are with his Liverpool contract drawing to a close and about to leave for Madrid on a free transfer. One goal against Leicester, one emphatic celebration in front of the away end, and all it did was confirm what many have felt for months: Trent’s gone. Not officially, of course. No club statement. No farewell reel. But emotionally? Spiritually? Trent left Liverpool long before that ball hit the net at the King Power.\n\nAnd what hurts isn’t just that he’s going — it’s how silent he’s been on the way out.\n\nSilence That Screams\n\nThere’s been no betrayal. No antics. No headlines burned into the back pages. No phantom back injury. Trent’s not refused to play. He’s not dragged Liverpool’s name through the mud. In fact, he’s been professional — sometimes even brilliant.\n\nBut when it comes to connection, to loyalty, and to the fragile thread between club legends and the fans who elevate them, Trent’s silence has been deafening.\n\nSupporters don’t ask for much. A sentence. A gesture. Just a flicker of acknowledgment that this all meant something. That the kid from West Derby knows what it meant to those who sang ‘Scouser In Our Team’ in 2016 and never stopped. Instead, all we’ve had is guarded interviews and well-managed vagueness. Not a single syllable about the future. Not one word that made you believe this was still home.\n\nSunday should have been the moment. Back from injury, scores the winner, fans belting his song from the rafters. If there was ever a time to open the book and tell us where we were in the story — that was it. But Trent closed the cover.\n\nLegacy in Limbo\n\nThere’s a mural of him on Sybil Road. A reminder of what he was. What he could have been. It once felt like a foreword to a story that would end in captaincy, statues, and stand names. Now, it feels like a full stop.\n\nTrent will lift another Premier League trophy with Liverpool in a few weeks’ time. That’s a certainty, and a fitting send-off for a player who, when at his best, changed the geometry of English football. His ability, his delivery, his intelligence — all of it was generational. But it won’t be remembered like Gerrard’s slide-tackles in the rain or Dalglish’s grin behind a European Cup.\n\nWhy? Because how you leave matters.\n\nHad he stayed, had he dug in under Arne Slot — who replaced Jürgen Klopp this season and is now set to deliver a title in his first season — the narrative could have been different. A reinvented team under a new leader. A fresh dawn, built around a Scouser. Instead, he walks, just as two of the club’s biggest icons, Van Dijk and Salah, double down on their commitment.\n\nAnd where does he go? To Madrid — a club currently defined not by unity, but by ego. A side bloated with talent but no shared purpose. And Trent, in his self-enthusing ‘galáctico’ mode, should fit right in. It’s not hard to imagine him standing on a balcony in the Spanish capital, Bellingham on one side, Mbappe on the other, fireworks behind them as Los Blancos celebrate another trophy, and wondering why it doesn’t quite feel the same.\n\nRight Decision, Wrong Way\n\nNo one denies the allure of Real Madrid. The Bernabéu. The galáctico sheen. But not all great players make great choices. And timing is everything.\n\nTrent is not leaving because his career stagnated. He’s not being pushed out. He’s leaving as a Premier League winner, in his prime, with a reinvented Liverpool on the rise and a fan base ready to believe in him all over again. And yet, he walks — in silence.\n\nHe could have owned this city. Been the banner, the captain, the heartbeat. Now, he will likely be remembered more like Steve McManaman — gifted, but always with an asterisk. “Great player, but…”\n\nWhat’s hardest for many is that Trent is one of us. Or was. He knew what it meant. That’s why the silence stings. Not because he owes us an explanation, but because we expected better.\n\nFinal Whistle\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold will lift another trophy at Anfield. He’ll get the applause. He’ll get the songs. But he will not get the legacy that seemed his for the taking.\n\nHe could have been the definitive modern Liverpool icon — skill, story, soul. Instead, he’ll go down as the boy who had it all in his hands… and let it slip for a taste of something shinier, warmer in temperature but colder in heart.\n\nAnd one day, when he looks back at the cheers, the murals, the medals, maybe — just maybe — he’ll realise that none of it ever felt as warm as Liverpool once did.\n\nBecause greatness in football isn’t just about what you win. It’s about who you choose to win it with."}

At the King Power Stadium on Sunday, Liverpool carved out one of those moments. A late 1-0 win against Leicester City, thanks to a left-footed strike by Trent Alexander-Arnold, took them to within touching distance of a historic 20th Premier League title. But beyond the headlines, it’s Ryan Gravenberch’s resilience and quiet consistency that continues to shape Liverpool’s identity under Arne Slot.\n\nGravenberch’s Engine Drives Liverpool Forward\n\n“It was a late one but I’m very happy with the result,” Gravenberch told Liverpoolfc.com after the final whistle. “Even when we don’t play really good football, it’s all about the result… It’s all about the three points.”\n\nIt’s easy to focus on the dramatic moment – Alexander-Arnold’s goal on his weaker foot, after five weeks sidelined. Yet it’s Gravenberch who has become the glue in this side. He has now started every Premier League game this season, something few would have predicted just a year ago.\n\nThe Dutch midfielder has quietly transformed from a player with potential into a central pillar of Liverpool’s title charge. “Last season I didn’t play a lot and now I play almost every game. It’s tough but I still keep going,” he admitted. His shift to a defensive midfield role – dictated by Slot’s tactical vision – has been pivotal.\n\n“In the beginning of the season I had to adapt to the new role… but now I know what I have to do. The manager fully trusted me there, so I’m really happy with that.”\n\nSlot’s Faith Paying Off\n\nArne Slot has reshaped the midfield, and Gravenberch is the clearest example of that evolution. There’s no need for flashy flair or headline-grabbing stats – what matters is positioning, discipline, and composure. Gravenberch delivers all three.\n\nAgainst Leicester, he did what he’s done all season: provide structure, recover possession, and transition Liverpool into attack. The eye may have been drawn to the goal and the celebrations, but the control in the centre of the pitch was what allowed the drama to unfold.\n\nLiverpool’s transformation this season is grounded in that kind of control. With a squad that blends youth, experience, and an unrelenting belief in its mission, they now stand one win away from reclaiming the Premier League crown.\n\nFans and Figures: The Emotional Undercurrent\n\n“They [the fans] are amazing. Every week, every game, they are here and they support us,” Gravenberch said. “Also today, you see we really need them.”\n\nThere’s always something visceral about late wins away from home – especially with silverware on the horizon. But the scenes at full-time weren’t just about this result. They were about a team that has weathered difficult periods, transitioned away from a beloved manager in Jürgen Klopp, and yet somehow grown even more determined.\n\nGravenberch’s emergence is emblematic of that journey. Slot’s Liverpool are more pragmatic, more balanced, and perhaps even more dangerous as a result.\n\nOne Game, One Goal, One Title\n\nNow comes the final push. A home fixture against Tottenham Hotspur awaits, and three points will seal the title. Should Arsenal slip up midweek, Liverpool could be champions even sooner.\n\n“We need one more win, of course, and hopefully we can finish it in our home,” Gravenberch said. “We are really looking forward to that.”\n\nGravenberch has already logged 45 appearances across all competitions this season – a remarkable number considering his limited game time last year. His endurance, and the trust placed in him, speaks volumes about his maturity and importance to this side.\n\nThe Dutchman also made sure to acknowledge another key figure in the dressing room. “In my opinion, he’s still playing but he is a Liverpool legend,” he said of Virgil van Dijk, who extended his contract this week. “He is really important for us. I’m really happy with him.”\n\nAnd perhaps that’s what makes this Liverpool side so compelling. They’re not a collection of superstars chasing headlines – they’re a squad united by belief, trust, and a single goal. With Ryan Gravenberch at the heart of it, Liverpool are a single victory away from Premier League immortality."}

And at the centre of it all—of course—is Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nThe Scouser in the team, the lad from West Derby, the generational full-back whose career arc has so closely mirrored Liverpool’s resurgence over recent years, is now the subject of very real, very serious speculation. And after his goal and emotional celebration in the 1-0 win over Leicester City, fans have been left asking one painful question: could this be his parting gift?\n\nCredit must go to David Lynch, who joined Dave Davis for Anfield Index and painted the picture in simple, unambiguous terms: “I’ve not had any indication that he is going to stay at the moment.”\n\nEmotional clarity in uncertain times\n\nIn a game full of nerves and tension, Trent’s match-winner at the King Power wasn’t just a technically perfect strike—it was a moment that cut through the noise. His celebration was raw and revealing, and for those watching, spoke louder than any post-match interview could.\n\nLynch echoed that sentiment: “I think what you saw in the celebration was that it does mean a lot to him and he does love Liverpool and I get it.” But love, as he rightly notes, doesn’t always equate to permanence. “You can love Liverpool and still want to go and try something new—especially when you have won everything there is to win here.”\n\nAnd that’s the difficult truth supporters are grappling with now. Because this isn’t about a player running down his contract or angling for a wage bump. It’s about ambition, legacy, and perhaps even reinvention.\n\nA legend already—at just 25\n\nThere’s a strange poetry to the possibility of Trent leaving on the highest of highs. Born into a club in chaos, he grew into a leader, a record-setter, a European and Premier League champion. If he were to leave after helping secure another title, it wouldn’t be as a player seeking escape—it would be as one choosing evolution.\n\nAs Lynch observed, “It’s still very important to him and that goal will mean a lot to him.” That sentiment, simple as it is, reveals how emotionally loaded these final weeks could become. Fans may be watching not only a title race but also a farewell tour.\n\nNo U-turn expected\n\nDespite the goal, despite the outpouring from the fanbase, Lynch was clear: “I don’t think it’s going to create a u-turn but it was a big moment for him and the supporters.” Therein lies the contradiction Liverpool must live with for now. A player whose heart still beats for Anfield but whose feet may be set on a different path.\n\nSlot’s arrival, a new era unfolding, and the potential for a changing of the guard all combine to create a uniquely bittersweet backdrop. There’s no anger toward Trent—only gratitude, sadness, and perhaps a tinge of hope that this still might not be the end.\n\nFinal answers after final whistles\n\nSo, what comes next? As Lynch stated plainly: “It’s a strange situation but that’s just what it is at the moment, and I took from his interview after the game that he does want to go and that is still the expectation around everyone at the club.”\n\nThat final sentence carries weight. Not rumour. Not tabloid noise. But expectation from those who would know. And yet, in this most dramatic of footballing theatres, nothing is final until it is confirmed.\n\n“I think we will get public confirmation once Liverpool have definitely won the Premier League title,” Lynch concluded. A fitting bookend, perhaps. The closing scene to a story that began in Melwood shadows and could end under the lights of a title-winning Anfield.\n\nUntil then, we wait. One more win. One more roar. And maybe, just maybe, one last moment of magic from number 66."}

According to Caught Offside, one of the names on their radar is Nottingham Forest’s Ola Aina — a Premier League regular attracting significant attention across the top six.\n\nSlot’s strategic rebuild underway\n\nArne Slot has inherited a Liverpool squad rich in talent but increasingly in transition. While key figures like Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk have committed their futures, the lingering uncertainty around Trent Alexander-Arnold’s position at the club is creating a ripple effect in recruitment strategy.\n\nShould Alexander-Arnold’s mooted move to Real Madrid materialise, Liverpool will be compelled to act swiftly and decisively in the market. And it seems they have a potential successor in mind.\n\nCaught Offside report that Liverpool are now monitoring 27-year-old Ola Aina, who has enjoyed an impressive campaign with Nottingham Forest. The Nigerian international has made 32 appearances this season, offering a blend of defensive solidity and attacking drive.\n\nA source cited in the report praises Aina’s “pace, composure, and ability to contribute at both ends of the pitch.” This well-rounded profile is exactly what Slot values in wide defenders.\n\nStrong competition for Aina\n\nLiverpool are not alone in their pursuit. Chelsea — Aina’s former club — along with Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, are also said to be tracking his progress.\n\n“Chelsea, where Aina began his professional career, are keen on a reunion,” the report notes, indicating that any deal will require strong negotiation and a clear role for the player.\n\nDespite Chelsea’s romantic appeal and Spurs’ European ambitions, Liverpool can offer something unique: the opportunity to replace one of the club’s most iconic figures and shape the next generation of Anfield leadership.\n\nWhile much depends on Trent’s decision, Aina’s Premier League experience and tactical versatility make him a logical target for a Liverpool side looking to modernise its defensive options without losing structural balance.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThe idea of replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold with Ola Aina feels like a downgrade, not just in quality, but in ambition. Aina is a solid player — quick, reliable, experienced — but can he replicate the game-changing impact Trent has from that right-back slot?\n\nLet’s be honest: replacing a generational talent with a player who struggled to break into the Chelsea first team and only recently found consistent form at a struggling Forest side raises serious questions. This isn’t about disrespecting Aina — it’s about expectations. Slot’s supposed to usher in a new era, not cut corners.\n\nIf Trent does go, fans will want more than just a dependable full-back. They’ll want someone who can dominate matches, influence attacking phases, and grow into the leadership void left behind. Is Aina that player? Probably not.\n\nAnd given the clubs circling — Chelsea, Spurs, Newcastle — it feels like Liverpool are being reactive rather than proactive. If Trent stays, no problem. But if he leaves, many supporters will expect a more marquee name — someone who signals ambition, not just stability."}

Morgan Rogers, still just 22, has rapidly evolved into one of the Premier League’s most promising young attackers, and Liverpool, amid sweeping changes to their forward line, appear to be first in line to secure his services.\n\nAccording to a fresh update from Empire of the Kop, Rogers has soared to “the top of Liverpool’s transfer list.” The Reds are said to be “preparing a serious offer” for the Aston Villa attacker, who has racked up 27 goal contributions this season—14 goals and 13 assists—a staggering return for a player who cost Villa an initial £8m only 18 months ago.\n\nThat fee, potentially rising to £15m with add-ons, now looks like a minor investment compared to the numbers being floated for his next move. Reports suggest Villa could now demand up to £70m for Rogers. Whether or not that valuation proves accurate, what’s beyond doubt is that Liverpool’s interest is real and increasingly urgent.\n\nExit Signs for Nunez and Diaz Open Door for Change\n\nThe pursuit of Rogers is shaped by wider transfer plans at Anfield. Darwin Nunez’s time at the club may soon be up, with Fabrizio Romano claiming the Uruguayan is “almost certain” to leave. That alone might not spark a revamp, but when coupled with strong speculation around Luis Diaz’s departure, the message is clear: Liverpool’s attack could look markedly different in 2025.\n\nThere’s also noise around Hugo Ekitike, currently at Eintracht Frankfurt, as a potential new centre-forward. But while Ekitike could lead the line, Rogers appears tailored to the supporting roles either side of him—offering invention, width, and sharp decision-making in the final third.\n\nThe decision to invest in a homegrown Premier League star rather than another overseas project suggests a new approach: one that’s more measured and sustainable, avoiding the bedding-in issues that have plagued others in the past.\n\nValue and Vision Drive This Potential Deal\n\nAston Villa’s rapid transformation under Unai Emery has given Rogers the perfect stage to flourish. He’s intelligent off the ball, quick in transition, and has that rare calmness in high-pressure moments. His game isn’t just built on flair—it’s underpinned by purpose.\n\nWhile there’s no mention yet of a concrete bid or formal discussions, the tone of the report indicates Liverpool are poised to act quickly. Having only brought in one outfield player across the last three transfer windows, there’s a sense that funds have been reserved precisely for moves like this.\n\nLiverpool’s model has always relied on spotting value before the market catches up. But with a rumoured £70m price tag, this move may require them to pay a premium—not just for talent, but for readiness.\n\nFuture-Proofing Liverpool’s Attack\n\nIn targeting Rogers, Liverpool aren’t just shopping for talent. They’re securing a stylistic fit, a Premier League-proven creator who still has the potential to grow further. He won’t come cheap, but the price of standing still in the modern game is even higher.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index\n\nThere’s something incredibly exciting about Liverpool’s reported move for Morgan Rogers. After a few transfer windows of restraint, the idea of the club going big on a dynamic, Premier League-proven attacker feels like a statement of renewed intent.\n\nWhat stands out with Rogers isn’t just the numbers—though 27 goal contributions is elite for someone still finding his feet in top-flight football—it’s the intelligence and maturity in his game. He’s got that blend of power and poise that would slot in seamlessly under Arne Slot’s high-intensity, fluid attacking system.\n\nWith Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz potentially heading out, this isn’t just about depth—it’s about defining the next era of Liverpool’s forward line. Rogers could be that central figure in a new-look attack, someone who can do damage now but also grow into one of Europe’s best in the next three to five years.\n\nThe price tag will raise eyebrows, but let’s be honest: if Villa want £70m, that’s the going rate for a top-tier Premier League forward in today’s market. If he’s Arne Slot’s guy, and if the data backs it up, fans will back the board to get it done. Because this time, it feels like the rebuild is being done the Liverpool way—smart, strategic, and just a little bit bold."}

本書の目的と背景\n\n近年、生成AI技術は急速に普及し、日常生活やビジネスの現場で大きな影響力を持つようになりました。その活用の鍵を握るのが、「プロンプト作成」というスキルです。生成AIがどれだけ優れた回答を提供できるかは、プロンプトの質に大きく依存しています。そのため、適切なプロンプトを作成するスキルは、生成AIを最大限活用するうえで欠かせません。\n\nプロンプト作成には、さまざまな手法があります。たとえば、zero-shot promptingやfew-shot promptingといった基本的なアプローチから、回答の精度や深みを引き出すChain-of-Thought prompting、Generate Knowledge Promptingといった応用的な手法まで、多岐にわたります。また、日本国内では「深津式プロンプト」や「シュンスケ式プロンプト」といった独自のアプローチも注目されています。\n\nしかし、こうした技術や手法が存在する一方で、日本人がプロンプト作成で苦労するケースが多いのはなぜでしょうか。その背景には、日本語特有の文法構造や文化的な要素、そして高コンテクスト文化が深く関係していると考えられます。たとえば、日本語は主語や目的語の省略が頻繁に行われるため、生成AIに対して明確な指示を伝えることが難しくなる場合があります。また、日本文化では曖昧さや暗黙の了解がコミュニケーションの中核をなすことが多く、この特性が生成AIとの対話において課題を生むことも少なくありません。\n\n本書では、これらの課題を言語学の観点から掘り下げ、日本語が生成AIとの対話にどのように影響を与えるのかを分析します。そして、これらの課題を克服するための具体的なアプローチを提示します。たとえば、日本語の特性を考慮したプロンプト作成の工夫や、生成AIとの効果的な対話方法などについて解説します。\n\n以上を踏まえ、本書は、生成AIの時代において日本人が抱える特有の課題を解決し、その潜在力を最大限に引き出すための道筋を探るものです。\n\n1.2 生成AIのプロンプト作成の重要性\n\n生成AIが提供する能力は、プロンプト次第で大きく変化します。質の高いプロンプトを与えることで、AIはより正確で実用的な回答を返す一方、不適切なプロンプトでは期待外れの結果に終わることもあります。そのため、プロンプト作成は生成AIを効果的に活用するための基本スキルとして、ますます重要視されています。\n\n生成AIのプロンプト作成を考える際、その本質はAIとの「対話」にあります。プロンプトは単なる入力データではなく、AIとの協働を生む「指示」や「ガイドライン」の役割を果たします。たとえば、質問が曖昧である場合、AIはその曖昧さを埋めるために誤った前提を採用する可能性があります。逆に、的確で具体的なプロンプトはAIのポテンシャルを最大限に引き出し、予想以上の価値を生むことができます。\n\nしかし、生成AIの多くは海外で開発されており、英語圏の言語や文化をベースに設計されています。この点が、日本人にとってプロンプト作成を難しくする一因となっています。たとえば、日本語のような高コンテクストな言語や、主語や目的語を省略する文法構造は、AIの解釈に混乱を生む可能性があります。また、文化的背景に起因するコミュニケーションスタイルの違いも、AIが意図を正確に汲み取る妨げとなることがあります。\n\nプロンプト作成の手法には、zero-shot promptingやfew-shot promptingといった基本的なアプローチから、回答の精度を向上させるChain-of-Thought prompting、Generate Knowledge Promptingといった応用的な技術まで、多岐にわたる選択肢があります。しかし、こうした手法の多くが英語を前提としているため、日本語環境ではそのまま適用できないこともしばしばです。このギャップを埋めるためには、日本語の特性を考慮した独自のプロンプト作成法を開発・習得する必要があります。\n\n生成AIがもたらす変化のスピードは日々加速しています。その波に乗るためには、単なるAI利用者ではなく、AIを意図的に活用する「設計者」としてのスキルを身につけることが重要です。特に日本人にとっては、海外で設計されたAIの特性を理解しつつ、自国の言語や文化に適応させる能力が求められます。プロンプト作成はその第一歩であり、AI活用の未来を切り拓くための必須スキルです。\n\n1.3

日本語と英語の文法的特徴の比較\n\n日本語は、主語の省略や動詞の後置など、文法構造において独特の特徴を持つ言語です。これらの特徴は、日常のコミュニケーションにおいては柔軟性や効率性をもたらしますが、生成AIとの対話においてはしばしば課題となります。本節では、日本語の文法的特徴を詳しく検討し、それが生成AIのプロンプト作成にどのような影響を与えるのかを探ります。\n\n主語の省略\n\n日本語の大きな特徴の一つは、主語を省略することが多い点です。日本語では、文脈が明確であれば主語を明示する必要がなく、自然な会話では「私は」や「あなたは」などの主語を省くことが一般的 です。たとえば、次のような会話が成立します。\n\n「昨日、映画を見た。」（主語が省略されているが、文脈から「私が映画を見た」と解釈できる）\n\n「どうする？」（主語が省略されているが、文脈から「あなたはどうする？」と理解される）\n\nこの省略の文化は、日常会話では便利ですが、生成AIとのやり取りでは誤解や曖昧さを生む原因となります。生成AIは明示的な情報を基に応答を生成するため、主語が不明瞭なプロンプトでは意図を正確に理解することが難しくなることがあります。たとえば、「行きたい」とだけ入力すると、生成AIは「誰が行きたいのか？」という情報が不足しているため、適切な応答を生成できない場合があります。\n\n動詞後置の文法構造\n\n日本語のもう一つの重要な特徴は、動詞が文の最後に位置することです。これは日本語の「SOV（主語-目的語-動詞）」という語順に由来します。たとえば、\n\n「私は昨日、映画を見た。」\n\n「彼がプレゼントを買った。」\n\nこの構造により、動詞に至るまで文の意味が完全に明確にならない場合があります。一方、英語の「SVO（主語-動詞-目的語）」の構造では、文の早い段階で主要な動作が明らかになります（例: \"I watched a movie yesterday.\"）。この違いは、生成AIとのやり取りにおいて重要です。日本語では、長い文の場合、文の終わりに到達するまでAIが正確な意図を解釈できないことがあり、特に複雑な文では誤解を招く可能性があります。\n\n助詞の多様性\n\n日本語は助詞を用いて文の意味や役割を明確にしますが、その使い方は文脈や意図に依存することが多く、場合によっては曖昧さを伴います。たとえば、「が」「は」「を」などの助詞は文法的には異なる役割を持ちますが、会話では省略されたり、誤解を生む使い方をされることがあります。この助詞の多様性も生成AIが正確な意図を把握する上での課題となります。\n\n日本語文法構造がプロンプト作成に与える影響\n\nこれらの日本語の文法的特徴は、生成AIにとって曖昧さや情報不足を引き起こしやすい要因となります。主語や目的語が省略されている場合、AIは文脈を理解するのに苦労することがあります。また、動詞が文末に位置することで、プロンプトが長くなるほど意図が曖昧になりやすくなります。このため、日本語で生成AIを効果的に活用するためには、主語や動詞を明確にしたり、簡潔で具体的なプロンプトを心がける必要があります。\n\n英語は、主語を必ず明示し、文全体の語順に明確な規則がある言語です。この特徴は、生成AIが意図を正確に理解し、適切な応答を生成する上で有利に働く場合が多いです。本節では、英語の文法的特徴を詳細に分析し、それがプロンプト作成においてどのように機能するかを検討します。\n\n主語の明示\n\n英語の文法では、主語を省略することは基本的にありません。たとえば、日常会話や文章では以下のような文が一般的です。\n\n\" I watched a movie yesterday.\"\n\nwatched a movie yesterday.\" \"She is going to the park.\"\n\n英語では、文脈に関わらず、主語が明示されていないと文として成立しません。この特徴により、英語の文は文脈依存性が比較的低く、AIにとって解釈しやすい構造となっています。主語が常に明示されるため、AIは「誰が」「何をするのか」といった情報を曖昧さなく受け取ることができ、応答の精度が向上します。\n\n生成AIのプロンプト作成においても、この特性は明確な指示を与える上で有利に働きます。たとえば、「Please provide a summary of this text.」 のように、主語と行動を明示することで、AIが期待される応答を容易に把握できます。\n\n語順の規則性\n\n英語は「SVO（主語-動詞-目的語）」という語順が基本であり、この構造が文の意味を迅速に理解する助けとなります。たとえば、\n\n\"I read a book.\"（私は本を読んだ）\n\n\"They play soccer every weekend.\"（彼らは毎週末サッカーをする）\n\nこれらの文では、主語が最初に登場し、次に動詞、そして目的語が続くため、文の意味が文頭から順次明確になります。このような語順の規則性により、文が長くなった場合でも、途中で主要な意味が把握可能であり、AIが応答を生成する際の負担が軽減されます。\n\nまた、英語では接続詞や句読点を活用することで、複雑な文でも意味を明確に保つことができます。たとえば、\n\n\"Although it was raining, they decided to play soccer.\"（雨が降っていたにもかかわらず、彼らはサッカーをすることにした）\n\nこのような明確な構造は、生成AIが文を分解して意味を解析する際に役立ちます。\n\n語彙の多様性と具体性\n\n英語は、語彙が非常に豊富で具体的な表現が可能です。たとえば、「run」という単語には「sprint（短距離で全力疾走する）」「jog（軽く走る）」といった多くの類義語があります。このような語彙の多様性により、プロンプト作成時に意図を正確に伝えるための言葉選びがしやすくなります。\n\nさらに、英語では形容詞や副詞を活用することで、指示をより具体的にすることが可能です。たとえば、\n\n\"Write a detailed and concise summary of this report.\"（このレポートの詳細で簡潔な要約を書いてください）\n\nこのような具体的な指示が可能である点も、生成AIとの相性の良さを高める要因です。\n\n英語文法構造がプロンプト作成に与える影響\n\n英語の文法構造は、主語を明示し、語順が規則的であるため、AIがプロンプトを効率的に解釈するのに適しています。これにより、生成AIの応答精度が向上し、ユーザーが意図する結果を得やすくなります。さらに、具体的かつ明確な指示が可能なため、AIとのコミュニケーションが効率的かつ効果的になります。\n\n次節では、日本語と英語の文法構造を比較し、それぞれの違いがプロンプト作成にどのような影響を与えるのかをさらに深掘りします。\n\n2.3 文法の違いがプロンプト作成に与える影響\n\n生成AIを効果的に活用するうえで、プロンプトの文法構造がAIの応答に与える影響は無視できません。特に日本語は、英語と比較して大きく異なる文法特性を持つため、この違いがプロンプト作成において重要な課題となります。\n\nまず、日本語は主語や目的語を省略する傾向が強い言語です。日常会話においては文脈から省略された部分を補うことができますが、生成AIにとってはこの省略が理解の障害になることがあります。たとえば、「それはどう思う？」という質問では、「それ」が何を指しているか明示されていないため、AIは曖昧な回答を返す可能性が高まります。一方、英語では「What do you think about this proposal?」のように、主語や目的語が明示されることが多く、AIが意図を誤解するリスクは低くなります。\n\nまた、日本語は語順が柔軟であり、話し手の意図や表現スタイルに応じて言葉の順序を変更できます。この特徴は自然な表現を可能にしますが、生成AIにとっては解釈の多様性を生むため、正確な応答を困難にする場合があります。たとえば、「昨日、学校で見た犬」という表現は、文脈次第で「犬が学校にいた」「学校で犬を見かけた」など、複数の解釈が可能です。\n\nさらに、敬語や婉曲表現といった日本語特有の文化的要素も、プロンプト作成に影響を及ぼします。敬語は社会的な文脈や人間関係を反映するため、AIがそのニュアンスを正確に理解することは難しい場合があります。たとえば、「お忙しいところ恐れ入りますが」のようなフレーズは、英語の簡潔な表現と異なり、意図が間接的に示されることが多いです。この曖昧さが、AIの解釈にさらなる負担を与えます。\n\n文法の違いは、プロンプト作成の工夫によって克服することが可能です。たとえば、AIに対して明確な指示を与えるために、省略を避けて具体的な言葉を使う、または簡潔な語順を意識することで、AIの応答の精度を高めることができます。また、日本語特有の表現を避け、標準的な文法に基づいたプロンプトを設計することも有効です。\n\nこのように、日本語と英語の文法の違いは、プロンプト作成の課題だけでなく、新しい工夫やアプローチの可能性を提示しています。これらの違いを理解し、適切に対応することが、日本語ユーザーが生成AIを効果的に活用する鍵となるでしょう。\n\n3. 文化的背景と思考様式の違い\n\n3.1 日本の高コンテクスト文化と英語圏の低コンテクスト文化\n\n生成AIを活用する際には、言語だけでなく、その背後にある文化的背景が重要な役割を果たします。特に、日本と英語圏では、情報の伝え方や受け取り方に関して大きな違いが存在します。それを理解するための鍵となるのが「高コンテクスト文化」と「低コンテクスト文化」という概念です。\n\nこの文化的違いは、生成AIとの対話にも直接影響を与えます。日本語のような高コンテクスト文化に基づくプロンプトは、文脈や暗黙の了解に依存しやすい傾向があり、AIにとって解釈が難しい場合があります。一方、低コンテクスト文化を背景に持つ英語圏では、具体的で明示的な表現が好まれるため、AIにとって理解しやすい指示が自然に生まれます。以下では、それぞれの文化的特徴について詳しく見ていきます。\n\n高コンテクスト文化とは\n\n日本は 「高コンテクスト文化」 に分類される典型的な社会です。高コンテクスト文化では、コミュニケーションの多くが文脈に依存し、言葉にされない部分が大きな意味を持ちます。このような文化では、話し手と聞き手の間に共通の背景知識や暗黙の了解が存在することが前提とされます。そのため、話し手は詳細を省略したり、間接的な表現を用いたりする傾向があります。\n\nたとえば、以下のような表現が日常的に使われます。\n\n「これで大丈夫でしょうか？」（具体的な指示がなくても状況から何を指しているのかが推測される）\n\n「もう少し考えたほうがいいですね。」（直接的に「ダメ」と言わずに修正を促す）\n\nこれらの表現は、日本語話者同士では円滑に機能しますが、明示的な情報が必要な生成AIとのやり取りでは、意図が伝わりにくい原因となります。\n\n低コンテクスト文化とは\n\n一方で、英語圏は 「低コンテクスト文化」 に属します。この文化では、コミュニケーションは主に言葉そのものに依存し、発言内容を明確かつ具体的にすることが重視されます。話し手と聞き手の間で共有される背景知識が少ない場合でも、言葉自体が意味を伝える役割を果たします。そのため、英語圏では、明確で直接的な表現が一般的です。\n\nたとえば、次のような表現がよく見られます。\n\n\"Could you please send the report by 5 PM today?\"（具体的な指示と締め切りを明示）\n\n\"The presentation needs to include at least three examples.\"（必要な要件を明確に記述）\n\n低コンテクスト文化の特徴により、生成AIは英語のプロンプトを解釈しやすく、ユーザーが期待する結果を返しやすいと言えます。\n\n高コンテクストと低コンテクストがプロンプト作成に与える影響\n\n生成AIは、情報を処理する際に明確な指示を求めます。そのため、高コンテクスト文化的なプロンプトは、AIにとって解釈の余地が多く、誤解を生む可能性が高まります。たとえば、日本語のプロンプトで「次の手続きはどうすればいい？」とだけ記載すると、AIは「次」が何を指しているのかを推測する必要があります。一方、低コンテクスト文化のアプローチを採用し、「For the document submission process, what should I do next?」のように具体的な指示を与えることで、AIの応答精度が格段に向上します。\n\nさらに、敬語や婉曲表現といった日本語特有の文化的要素も影響を与えます。日本語では「お手数ですが」「恐れ入りますが」といった間接的な表現が多く使われますが、これらがAIには曖昧さとして捉えられることがあります。一方で、英語の「Can you please...?」といった表現は、簡潔でわかりやすいため、AIに対して意図を伝えやすいのです。\n\n日本語プロンプト作成における課題と改善の必要性\n\n日本語の高コンテクスト文化は豊かなコミュニケーションを可能にする一方で、生成AIの活用においては課題となる場合があります。AIが意図を正確に理解するには、プロンプトの明確性と具体性が欠かせません。そのため、日本語ユーザーは以下のような改善を意識する必要があります。\n\n具体的な言葉を使う： 省略や曖昧な表現を避け、明示的な指示を与える。\n\n省略や曖昧な表現を避け、明示的な指示を与える。 文脈を補完する情報を含める： AIが誤解しないよう、背景情報をプロンプトに盛り込む。\n\nAIが誤解しないよう、背景情報をプロンプトに盛り込む。 低コンテクスト文化の視点を取り入れる： 英語のような明確な表現を意識してプロンプトを作成する。\n\nこれらの工夫を行うことで、日本語ユーザーでも生成AIをより効果的に活用することができるでしょう。日本語の高コンテクスト文化の特性を理解し、それに応じたプロンプト設計を行うことが、生成AIを最大限に活用するための鍵となります。\n\n3.2 集団主義と個人主義がもたらす表現の違い\n\n生成AIを効果的に活用するには、言語そのものだけでなく、その背景にある文化的な違いを理解することが重要です。日本と英語圏の文化は、特にコミュニケーションのスタイルにおいて大きな差異があります。それを象徴する概念が 「集団主義」 と 「個人主義」 です。\n\n日本の社会は集団主義の価値観に基づいており、個人よりも集団の調和や関係性を重視します。一方、英語圏の社会では個人主義が主流であり、個々の意思や行動の自由が尊重されます。この文化的背景の違いは、日常の言語表現に現れるだけでなく、生成AIとのやり取りにおけるプロンプト作成にも大きな影響を与えます。\n\n以下では、集団主義と個人主義の特徴、それぞれの文化がプロンプト作成に与える影響、そして日本語プロンプト作成における課題と改善策について詳しく見ていきます。\n\n集団主義の特徴と表現の傾向\n\n日本は「集団主義」の文化が強く根付いた社会です。この文化では、個人よりも集団全体の調和や関係性が重視されます。そのため、コミュニケーションにおいても、相手への配慮や集団内の和を保つことが表現の中核となります。たとえば、日本語では「～させていただきます」や「お手数ですが」といった丁寧で控えめな表現が頻繁に使われます。こうした言葉遣いは、自己主張を避け、他者との摩擦を最小限に抑えることを目的としています。\n\nこの集団主義の特性は、プロンプト作成にも影響を与えます。たとえば、生成AIに対する指示を遠回しに表現する傾向があり、明確性が欠ける場合があります。\n\n個人主義の特徴と表現の傾向\n\nこれに対し、英語圏では「個人主義」が文化の中心にあり、個人の意見や行動の自由が重視されます。この文化では、自己表現が促進され、コミュニケーションも率直で直接的な表現が好まれます。たとえば、「Please review and approve this document.」のように、主語が明確で、相手に期待する行動を具体的に指示する表現が一般的です。\n\n個人主義に基づくこの表現スタイルは、生成AIとの対話にも適しています。AIは、具体的で簡潔な指示を受けると、効率的かつ正確に応答できます。英語のプロンプトでは、このような文化的背景から生まれた明確性が自然に組み込まれているため、AIが意図を理解しやすいのです。\n\n集団主義と個人主義がプロンプト作成に与える影響\n\n集団主義と個人主義の文化的な違いは、プロンプト作成のスタイルにも反映されます。集団主義的なプロンプトは、配慮や曖昧さを含むことが多く、AIにとっては解釈の余地が広がり、誤解を生む可能性があります。一方、個人主義的なプロンプトは、明示的で具体的な指示を含むため、AIが意図を誤解しにくいという利点があります。\n\nたとえば、日本語で以下のようなプロンプトを作成すると、AIが解釈に困る可能性があります：\n\n「これを確認していただけますか？」\n\n→ 「これ」が何を指すのかが不明瞭。 「次のステップを教えてください。」\n\n→ 「次のステップ」が具体的に何を指すかが曖昧。 「できれば、このデータを整理していただけますか？」\n\n→ 「整理」の具体的な方法や目的がAIには分かりにくい。\n\n一方、英語で以下のように明確なプロンプトを作成することで、AIの解釈精度が向上します：\n\n\"Please review the attached document and provide feedback.\"\n\n→ レビュー対象と期待する行動が明示されています。 \"What is the next step in the document approval process?\"\n\n→ 「次のステップ」として何を知りたいかが具体的です。 \"Sort the data in the attached file by date and provide a summary.\"\n\n→ 整理方法と目的が明確に伝えられています。\n\n日本語プロンプト作成における課題と改善の方向性\n\n集団主義の文化が反映された日本語のプロンプトは、対人コミュニケーションでは効果的ですが、生成AIには必ずしも適していない場合があります。この課題を克服するには、以下のような改善が求められます。\n\n明示的な表現を増やす：指示や依頼の対象を具体的に記載する。 AIに配慮を必要としない表現を心がける：人間相手の配慮や遠回しな言葉遣いを省略する。 個人主義的な明確さを取り入れる：英語的な具体性を意識したプロンプトを作成する。\n\nこれらのアプローチを実践することで、日本語ユーザーも生成AIをより効率的に活用できるようになります。集団主義の特性を尊重しながら、AIとのやりとりに適した表現を工夫することが重要です。\n\n3.3 曖昧表現と明確表現の差異\n\n生成AIを効果的に活用するには、曖昧表現と明確表現の違いを理解し、それらがAIの応答にどのような影響を与えるかを知ることが重要です。曖昧表現は人間同士の対話では柔軟性や配慮として機能する場合がありますが、生成AIに対しては解釈の幅を広げ、意図しない応答を生む可能性があります。一方、明確表現はAIにとって解釈が容易であり、正確な応答を引き出すのに効果的です。\n\n以下では、曖昧表現と明確表現の特徴、それらが生成AIに与える影響、そして日本語プロンプト作成における改善の方向性について詳しく見ていきます。\n\n曖昧表現の特徴と影響\n\n曖昧表現は、日本語において特に顕著な特徴の一つです。たとえば、主語や目的語を省略する、または曖昧な語彙を使用することが一般的であり、文脈から意味を汲み取ることが期待されます。たとえば、「これを確認してください」という表現では、「これ」が何を指しているのかが文脈次第で異なります。\n\n生成AIにおいて曖昧表現を使用すると、AIが意図を正しく解釈できない可能性があります。たとえば、次のようなプロンプトではAIが不適切な回答を返すことがあります。\n\n「これをどう思いますか？」\n\n→「これ」が具体的に何を指すか不明。\n\n→「これ」が具体的に何を指すか不明。 「早めに対応してください。」\n\n→「早め」の具体的な期限が分からない。\n\n曖昧表現は人間同士の対話では柔軟さを提供しますが、AIは文脈や背景情報を深く理解する能力に限界があるため、誤解が生じるリスクがあります。\n\n明確表現の特徴と影響\n\n明確表現は、曖昧さを排除し、伝えたい情報を具体的に示す表現です。英語のような低コンテクスト言語では明確表現が主流であり、この特徴が生成AIとの対話に適しています。\n\nたとえば、以下のような明確表現を使用すると、AIはプロンプトを正確に解釈し、期待通りの応答を生成できます、\n\n\"What are your thoughts on the attached proposal?\"\n\n→「提案」が具体的に添付ファイルであることを明示。\n\n→「提案」が具体的に添付ファイルであることを明示。 \"Please respond by 5 PM today.\"\n\n→「早め」の期限が具体的に示されている。\n\n明確表現を使用することで、AIが余計な推測をせずに応答できるため、誤解が減少し、応答の質が向上します。\n\n曖昧表現と明確表現がプロンプト作成に与える影響\n\n曖昧表現と明確表現の差異は、プロンプト作成におけるAIの応答の正確性に直結します。曖昧表現を用いたプロンプトでは、AIが余計な解釈を行い、結果的に不適切な応答が得られる可能性が高まります。一方、明確表現を使用することで、AIはプロンプトを忠実に解釈し、意図に沿った応答を生成しやすくなります。\n\nたとえば、以下のようなプロンプトを比較するとその違いが明確です：\n\n曖昧表現： 「これを早く確認してください。」\n\n→「これ」が何を指すのか、どの程度の速度が求められるのかが不明。\n\n→「これ」が何を指すのか、どの程度の速度が求められるのかが不明。 明確表現：\"Please review the attached document and provide feedback by 5 PM.\"\n\n→「これ」が添付ファイルであること、具体的な期限が示されている。\n\n日本語プロンプト作成における課題と改善の方向性\n\n日本語プロンプト作成では、曖昧表現の使用を減らし、AIが正確に解釈できるような明確表現を増やすことが課題です。この課題に対応するため、以下のポイントを意識することが重要です。\n\n具体的な対象を明示する：「これ」や「あれ」のような代名詞を避け、具体的な対象を記載する。 指示内容を具体化する：「早め」「すぐに」といった主観的な表現を避け、具体的な期限や行動を示す。 背景情報を補足する：AIが意図を誤解しないよう、プロンプトに必要な文脈を含める。\n\nこれらの工夫を通じて、曖昧表現による誤解を減らし、生成AIを効果的に活用することが可能になります。。\n\n4. プロンプト作成における具体的な課題\n\n4.1 指示の具体性と曖昧さ\n\n生成AIに対して指示を与える際、具体性と曖昧さのバランスが結果に大きく影響します。具体的な指示はAIにとって解釈が容易であり、正確な応答を引き出すことができます。一方、曖昧な指示は柔軟性を生む一方で、解釈の余地が広がり、意図しない結果をもたらすことがあります。特に、日本語のように文脈依存の高い言語では、具体性を意識したプロンプト作成がより重要になります。\n\n以下では、具体性と曖昧さの特徴、それぞれが生成AIの応答に与える影響、そしてプロンプト作成における具体例を通じて、どのような指示が効果的かを考察します。\n\n具体性の重要性\n\n具体的な指示は、AIが正確に解釈し、期待される結果を出すための鍵です。具体性を持たせることで、AIが余計な推測をせずに済み、意図した通りの応答が得られやすくなります。\n\nたとえば、次のような具体的なプロンプトを考えます。\n\n\"Please summarize the key points from the attached document in bullet points.\"\n\n→ 対象物（添付ファイル）と期待する結果（箇条書きの要約）が明確です。 \"Generate a list of three marketing strategies for increasing social media engagement.\"\n\n→ 目的（ソーシャルメディアのエンゲージメント向上）と必要な出力（3つの戦略）が具体的に指定されています。 \"Sort the sales data in the attached spreadsheet by total revenue, in descending order.\"\n\n→ データの種類、操作内容、順序が明確に指示されています。\n\n具体性が高いプロンプトを用いることで、AIが行うべきタスクが明確化し、より正確な応答が期待できます。\n\n曖昧さの影響\n\n一方、曖昧な指示は、AIが応答を生成する際に推測を行う必要が生じます。これにより、柔軟な結果が得られる可能性がある一方で、期待とは異なる応答が生成されるリスクも伴います。\n\n次のような曖昧なプロンプトは、AIの解釈に依存しやすくなります。\n\n「これをどう思いますか？」\n\n→ 「これ」が何を指すのか不明確で、解釈の幅が広がります。 「アイデアをいくつか出してください。」\n\n→ 具体的なテーマや目的が不明で、AIが期待外れの提案をする可能性があります。 「このデータを整理してください。」\n\n→ データの種類や整理方法が指定されていないため、解釈が曖昧です。\n\n曖昧な指示では、AIが生成する応答が利用者の意図に合致しない場合が多くなるため、プロンプト作成時には曖昧さを最小限に抑えることが求められます。\n\n具体性と曖昧さの違いがプロンプト作成に与える影響\n\n具体的なプロンプトは、AIにとって解釈が明快であり、期待通りの結果を得やすいという利点があります。一方で、曖昧なプロンプトは柔軟性がある反面、AIの解釈に頼る必要があるため、意図しない応答が返ってくるリスクが高まります。\n\nたとえば、以下の2つのプロンプトを比較してみます。\n\n曖昧なプロンプト ： 「この内容についてまとめてください。」\n\n→ 「この内容」が具体的に何を指すのかが不明。\n\n： → 「この内容」が具体的に何を指すのかが不明。 具体的なプロンプト：\"Summarize the main points from the second paragraph of the attached article in 3 sentences.\"\n\n→ 対象（添付記事の2段落目）、タスク（要約）、出力形式（3文）が明確。\n\nこのように、具体性の欠如がAIの応答に与える影響は大きいため、プロンプト作成時には具体的な指示を心がけるべきです。\n\n日本語プロンプト作成における課題と改善案\n\n日本語のプロンプトは、文脈に依存しやすく、曖昧な指示になりがちです。この課題を克服するためには、以下の点を意識する必要があります。\n\n対象を明確にする：「これ」「あれ」ではなく、具体的な対象を明示する。 タスクを具体化する：求める結果や作業内容を詳細に記述する。 出力形式を指定する：必要な形式や範囲を具体的に示す。\n\nこれらの改善を実施することで、生成AIの応答精度を向上させ、意図した通りの結果を得ることが可能になります。\n\n4.2 文法的に正しいが生成AIに伝わりにくい日本語プロンプトの例\n\n生成AIは、文法的に正しい文章を解釈する能力を持っていますが、文法が正しいからといって意図を正確に汲み取れるとは限りません。特に日本語は、省略や曖昧表現を多用する傾向があるため、文法的に正しいにもかかわらず、生成AIにとって解釈が難しいプロンプトが生じることがあります。\n\nこのようなプロンプトでは、AIが過剰に推測を行ったり、曖昧さを補完しようとした結果、期待とは異なる応答が生成されることがあります。以下では、日本語特有の課題を示す具体例を挙げながら、生成AIに伝わりにくいプロンプトの特徴を考察します。\n\n文法的に正しいが生成AIに伝わりにくいプロンプトの例\n\n次のプロンプトは文法的には正しいものの、生成AIが意図を理解しづらい特徴を持っています。\n\n「この資料、どう思いますか？」\n\n→ 「この資料」が何を指しているか不明。資料の評価基準や目的も示されていないため、AIが適切な応答を生成しにくい。 「早めに返信してください。」\n\n→ 「早め」が具体的にいつを指しているのかが曖昧で、AIにとって解釈が困難。 「必要なデータを探して教えてください。」\n\n→ 「必要なデータ」が何を指しているかが指定されておらず、AIにとって範囲が広すぎる。\n\nこれらのプロンプトは文法的には問題ありませんが、AIが解釈する際には多くの推測を要し、結果的に意図しない応答が得られる可能性があります。\n\n問題点と改善方法\n\n上記のプロンプトが生成AIに伝わりにくい理由は、具体性の欠如と対象の曖昧さにあります。このような課題を克服するには、プロンプトを明確かつ具体的に設計する必要があります。\n\n改善されたプロンプトの例を以下に示します。\n\n「この資料について、要点を3つにまとめて教えてください。」\n\n→ 資料の具体的な対象は文脈で補う必要があるが、期待されるタスク（要約）と出力形式（3つ）が明確。 「本日17時までに、このメッセージの返信を作成してください。」\n\n→ 「早め」の具体的な期限（17時）が明示されているため、AIが誤解しにくい。 「売上データの中から、2023年度の月ごとの売上金額を抽出して教えてください。」\n\n→ 「必要なデータ」が何を指すかが具体的に示されており、AIが正確に応答できる。\n\n日本語プロンプト作成における注意点\n\n文法的な正確性に加え、以下のポイントを意識することで、生成AIが意図を理解しやすいプロンプトを作成できます。\n\n具体性を持たせる：対象やタスク、期待する出力形式を明確にする。 曖昧な語句を避ける：「これ」「早め」といった抽象的な表現を具体的に置き換える。 必要な文脈を含める：AIが判断するために必要な情報をプロンプト内に記載する。\n\nこれらの工夫を取り入れることで、日本語の特性を考慮しつつ、生成AIに伝わりやすいプロンプトを作成することが可能になります。\n\n4.3 思考様式が与えるプロンプト設計への影響\n\n思考様式とは、問題解決やコミュニケーションにおける情報の捉え方や処理の方法を指します。文化や個人の性格によって異なる思考様式は、生成AIに指示を与えるプロンプトの設計にも影響を及ぼします。たとえば、日本では全体の調和を重視する 「包括的思考」 が多く見られる一方、英語圏では特定の要素に焦点を当てる 「分析的思考」 が主流です。\n\nこの違いは、プロンプト設計において、曖昧さや具体性、情報の優先順位に反映されることが多いです。以下では、思考様式の違いがプロンプト設計に与える影響と、その具体的な例について詳しく考察します。\n\n包括的思考が与える影響\n\n包括的思考では、全体像や背景を重視する傾向があり、プロンプトにもその特性が現れます。たとえば、日本語のプロンプトでは、状況を広く説明するが具体的な指示が不足していることがあります。\n\n以下のようなプロンプトは、包括的思考の影響を受けています。\n\n「これまでのプロジェクトの成果を見て、次に何をするべきか提案してください。」\n\n→ 全体的な状況を考慮するよう促しているが、具体的な指示が曖昧。 「このデータをもとに、何か改善案があれば教えてください。」\n\n→ 全体的な分析を求めているが、AIに期待する範囲が広すぎる。 「複数の要素を考慮して、最適な解決策を出してください。」\n\n→ 「複数の要素」の内容が具体的でないため、AIが適切な提案を行いにくい。\n\nこれらのプロンプトは、文脈や背景を含めて考える人間には効果的ですが、生成AIに対しては解釈が難しくなる場合があります。\n\n分析的思考が与える影響\n\n分析的思考では、特定の要素に焦点を当て、明確な指示を与えることが特徴です。この特性は、生成AIに適したプロンプト設計に寄与することが多いです。\n\n以下は、分析的思考を反映した具体的なプロンプト例です。\n\n\"Based on the sales data for 2023 Q1, suggest two strategies to improve Q2 performance.\"\n\n→ 対象データ（2023年第1四半期）と期待する出力（2つの戦略）が具体的に示されています。 \"Identify the key issues from the attached report and provide three recommendations to address them.\"\n\n→ 特定のタスク（主要な問題の特定と提案）が明確です。 \"Sort the list of customers by revenue and highlight the top 5 contributors.\"\n\n→ 必要な操作と期待する結果（上位5名の顧客）が具体的です。\n\nこれらのプロンプトは、生成AIに対して具体的な目標を提示するため、正確で期待通りの応答を得やすくなります。\n\n思考様式の違いがプロンプト設計に与える影響\n\n包括的思考と分析的思考は、それぞれプロンプト設計における長所と短所を持っています。包括的思考では背景や全体像を考慮しやすい一方で、具体性に欠ける傾向があります。一方、分析的思考では、明確な指示を与えられるため、生成AIが効率的に応答できる傾向があります。\n\nたとえば、以下のような日本語プロンプトと英語プロンプトを比較すると、その違いが明確です。\n\n包括的プロンプト ： 「このデータを分析して、次に何をすればよいか提案してください。」\n\n→ 具体性が低く、AIに期待する範囲が広い。\n\n： → 具体性が低く、AIに期待する範囲が広い。 分析的プロンプト：\"Analyze the attached data to identify trends and recommend the next step for improving sales.\"\n\n→ データの目的（トレンド分析と提案）が明示されているため、解釈が容易。\n\n日本語プロンプト作成における改善案\n\n日本語プロンプト設計では、包括的思考の長所を活かしつつ、分析的思考の具体性を取り入れることで、生成AIに伝わりやすいプロンプトを作成することが可能です。以下の点に注意することが重要です。\n\n期待する結果を明確にする：何を出力してほしいのかを具体的に記述する。 背景情報を補足する：AIに必要な情報を補足し、推測の余地を減らす。 タスクを分解する：広範な要求を複数の具体的なタスクに分ける。\n\nこれらの工夫を通じて、思考様式の違いを理解しながら、より効果的なプロンプト設計を行うことが可能になります。\n\n5. 生成AIの活用に向けた改善策\n\n5.1 日本語を活かしたプロンプト作成の工夫\n\n日本語は豊かな表現力を持つ言語であり、高コンテクスト文化や曖昧さを許容する特徴が日常のコミュニケーションに深く根付いています。しかし、生成AIを活用する際には、これらの特徴がそのままでは効果的に働かない場合があります。日本語特有の曖昧さを排除しつつ、その豊かな表現力を活かしたプロンプトを作成することが、生成AIを最大限活用する鍵となります。\n\n以下では、日本語の特性を考慮したプロンプト作成の工夫について、具体例を交えながら解説します。\n\n日本語特有の表現を活かした工夫\n\n日本語の表現力を活かしつつ、生成AIが意図を正確に理解できるプロンプトを作成するには、以下のような工夫が有効です。\n\n1. 背景を簡潔に説明する\n\n日本語特有の高コンテクストなコミュニケーションでは、背景を省略しがちですが、生成AIに対しては必要な背景情報を簡潔に伝えることが重要です。\n\n曖昧なプロンプト： 「これを整理してください。」\n\n→ 「これ」が何を指すのか、どのように整理するのかが不明瞭。\n\n→ 「これ」が何を指すのか、どのように整理するのかが不明瞭。 改善されたプロンプト：「会議資料の中から、売上データを地域別に分類して整理してください。」\n\n→ 対象（会議資料）と具体的なタスク（売上データの地域別分類）が明確。\n\n2. 指示を具体的に分割する\n\n日本語では複数の要素を一度に伝える表現が多いですが、生成AIにはタスクを分割して伝える方が効果的です。\n\n曖昧なプロンプト： 「この報告書をわかりやすくしておいてください。」\n\n→ 「わかりやすく」の意味が抽象的。\n\n→ 「わかりやすく」の意味が抽象的。 改善されたプロンプト：「この報告書の要約を作成し、重要なデータを表形式で整理してください。」\n\n→ 要約作成と表形式でのデータ整理という2つのタスクが明示。\n\n3. 曖昧さを排除する\n\n日本語の曖昧さは生成AIには適応しづらいため、具体性を持たせることが必要です。\n\n曖昧なプロンプト： 「早めに対応してください。」\n\n→ 「早め」の具体的な期限が不明。\n\n→ 「早め」の具体的な期限が不明。 改善されたプロンプト：「このメールに本日17時までに返信内容を作成してください。」\n\n→ 期限とタスク（メール返信）が具体的に示されている。\n\n日本語特有の工夫がもたらす効果\n\nこれらの工夫を取り入れることで、日本語の豊かな表現力を活かしながら、生成AIにとって解釈が容易なプロンプトを作成することが可能になります。具体性を持たせるだけでなく、日本語の特徴である柔らかい表現や敬語を適切に活用することで、生成される応答の質やニュアンスをコントロールしやすくなります。\n\nたとえば、以下のようなプロンプトの違いを考えてみます。\n\n曖昧なプロンプト： 「お願いします。」\n\n→ 「何をお願いしているのか」が全く不明。\n\n→ 「何をお願いしているのか」が全く不明。 改善されたプロンプト：「次の会議のために、2023年度の売上データを部門ごとに集計してください。」\n\n→ AIに具体的なタスクと目的を伝えることで、意図した応答が得られやすくなります。\n\nプロンプト作成時に意識すべきポイント\n\n日本語を活かしたプロンプトを作成する際には、以下のポイントを意識すると効果的です。\n\n背景情報を簡潔に示す：AIが必要な文脈を理解できるように、適切な背景情報を含める。 タスクを具体的にする：複雑な要求を分解し、それぞれを明確に指示する。 ニュアンスを調整する：敬語や柔らかい表現を適切に活用して、生成される応答のトーンをコントロールする。\n\nこれらの工夫により、日本語の特性を最大限活かしながら、生成AIを効率的かつ効果的に活用できるプロンプトを作成することができます。\n\n5.2 英語的思考法を取り入れたプロンプト作成の手法\n\n生成AIを効果的に活用するには、明確性や具体性を重視した英語的思考法をプロンプト作成に取り入れることが有効です。英語圏のコミュニケーションは、情報を明示的に伝え、相手が推測せずに理解できる表現を好む傾向があります。この特性を日本語プロンプトにも応用することで、生成AIが意図を正確に汲み取りやすくなります。\n\n以下では、英語的思考法の特徴を活かしたプロンプト作成手法を具体例を交えながら解説します。\n\n英語的思考法を取り入れるポイント\n\n英語的思考法を取り入れる際の基本は、指示内容を明確かつ具体的にすることです。これには以下の要素が含まれます。\n\n主語と目的語を明示する\n\n日本語では省略されがちな主語や目的語を明確に示すことで、AIが解釈を誤る可能性を減らします。 曖昧なプロンプト： 「これを整理してください。」\n\n→ 「これ」が何を指すかが不明。\n\n→ 「これ」が何を指すかが不明。 英語的思考を取り入れた例：\"Organize the attached sales data by region and year.\"\n\n→ 整理するデータ（添付の売上データ）、基準（地域と年）が具体的に示されています。 期待する出力形式を指定する\n\n出力結果がどのような形式であるべきかを明確に示すことで、AIの応答を制御できます。 曖昧なプロンプト： 「報告書をまとめてください。」\n\n→ どのような形式でまとめるのかが不明。\n\n→ どのような形式でまとめるのかが不明。 英語的思考を取り入れた例：\"Summarize the report in bullet points, highlighting the top three findings.\"\n\n→ 要約形式（箇条書き）と強調すべき要点（トップ3）が具体的です。 タスクを分割して順序立てる\n\n一度に複数の指示を与えるのではなく、タスクを段階的に分割することで、AIの処理がより正確になります。 曖昧なプロンプト： 「このデータを分析して、必要なら改善案を出してください。」\n\n→ 分析内容や改善案の範囲が不明。\n\n→ 分析内容や改善案の範囲が不明。 英語的思考を取り入れた例：\"First, analyze the attached data for trends. Then, provide three actionable recommendations to improve performance.\"\n\n→ 分析と提案のタスクが順序立てて示されています。\n\n英語的思考法を活用した具体例\n\n以下は、英語的思考法を意識したプロンプトの例です。\n\n\"Identify the key points from the meeting notes and summarize them in three sentences.\"\n\n→ 目的（要点の特定と要約）と形式（3文）が明確に示されています。 \"Sort the attached list of customers by revenue and highlight the top five.\"\n\n→ 作業内容（顧客リストの並び替え）と注目するポイント（上位5名）が具体的です。 \"Based on the provided data, suggest two strategies to increase market share in Q4.\"\n\n→ データの対象（提供されたデータ）と期待する結果（2つの戦略）が具体的に指定されています。\n\n英語的思考法を取り入れるメリット\n\n英語的思考法を取り入れることで、生成AIにとって解釈が容易になり、意図した結果が得られる可能性が高まります。また、具体性を重視したプロンプトは、誤解を防ぎ、出力内容の一貫性や品質を向上させる効果があります。\n\nたとえば、以下のような日本語プロンプトと英語プロンプトを比較すると、その違いが明確です。\n\n曖昧な日本語プロンプト： 「このデータから何か提案してください。」\n\n→ データの範囲や提案内容の基準が不明。\n\n→ データの範囲や提案内容の基準が不明。 英語的思考を取り入れたプロンプト：\"Review the attached sales data and provide two recommendations to increase revenue in the next quarter.\"\n\n→ データ（売上データ）、目的（次の四半期の収益向上）、出力（2つの提案）が具体的です。\n\nプロンプト作成時に意識すべきポイント\n\n英語的思考法を日本語プロンプトに応用する際には、以下を意識すると効果的です。\n\n主語や目的語を明示する：曖昧な代名詞を避け、対象を具体的に記述する。 期待する形式や結果を具体的に示す：AIがどのような出力を生成すべきかを明確にする。 タスクを分割し、順序を明示する：複雑な指示を分割して、段階的に伝える。\n\nこれらの工夫により、日本語の特性を活かしつつ、英語的な具体性を取り入れたプロンプトを作成することができます。\n\n5.3 生成AIにプロンプトの添削をさせる\n\n生成AIを活用する際、適切なプロンプトを作成するのは重要なスキルですが、最初から完璧なプロンプトを作るのは難しい場合があります。そこで、生成AI自体にプロンプトの添削を依頼し、改善案を提案してもらう方法が効果的です。生成AIは、明確さや具体性を向上させるアイデアを提供し、プロンプトの品質を高める手助けをします。\n\n以下では、生成AIにプロンプト添削を依頼する手法を解説し、具体例を通じてその効果を示します。\n\nプロンプト添削を生成AIに依頼する手法\n\n生成AIにプロンプトの添削を依頼する際には、元のプロンプトとともに、どのような観点で改善を求めるかを明確に伝えることが重要です。以下の手法が有効です。\n\n1. 添削の目的を伝える\n\nAIに対して、どのような点を改善してほしいかを明示することで、的確な提案を得られます。\n\n原文プロンプト： 「これをわかりやすく書き直してください。」\n\nAIへの指示： 「以下のプロンプトを、具体性を高めた形に改善してください。」 元のプロンプト ：「このデータを整理して、結果を教えてください。」 改善後のプロンプト ：「売上データを地域別に集計し、各地域の合計売上額を教えてください。」\n\n\n\n2. 改善の観点を具体的に指定する\n\n明確性、簡潔さ、トーンなど、改善の焦点を明示するとより効果的です。\n\n原文プロンプト： 「次の提案をしてみてください。」\n\nAIへの指示： 「以下のプロンプトを具体的かつ明確に改善してください。」 元のプロンプト ：「このマーケティング戦略を考えてください。」 改善後のプロンプト ：「20代向けの新製品に関するマーケティング戦略を3つ提案してください。」\n\n\n\n3. 複数の改善案を依頼する\n\nAIに複数のバリエーションを提案させることで、最適なプロンプトを選択できます。\n\n原文プロンプト： 「もっとわかりやすくしてみてください。」\n\nAIへの指示： 「以下のプロンプトを異なるアプローチで3つ改善してください。」 元のプロンプト ：「この資料を見て、意見を教えてください。」 改善後のプロンプト案 ： 「この資料のメリットとデメリットをそれぞれ教えてください。」 「この資料に基づいて、次の会議で話し合うべきポイントを3つ挙げてください。」 「この資料の主要な要点を箇条書きでまとめてください。」\n\n\n\n生成AIにプロンプト添削を依頼するメリット\n\n生成AIにプロンプト添削を依頼することで、次のようなメリットが得られます。\n\n視点の広がり：自身では気づきにくい曖昧さや不足点を指摘してもらえる。 作業効率の向上：手間をかけずに複数の改善案を得られるため、短時間でプロンプトを洗練できる。 具体性の向上：生成AIの提案を取り入れることで、プロンプトの具体性や明確性が高まる。\n\nプロンプト添削の注意点\n\nAIによるプロンプト添削は便利ですが、以下の点に注意する必要があります。\n\n元の意図が損なわれないようにする：AIが提案した改善案が、元のプロンプトの目的や意図と一致しているか確認する。 依存しすぎない：AIの提案をそのまま使うのではなく、自身で適切に修正・補完する意識を持つ。 具体的な指示を与える：AIに依頼する際には、改善の観点や目的を明確に伝える。\n\nプロンプト改善プロンプトの一例\n\n以下に、プロンプトを改善するためのプロンプト例を示します。\n\n「次のプロンプトを、ChatGPTがより精度の高い回答を生成できるように修正してください。プロンプトを修正する際には、以下の点を考慮してください。 目的を明確にする\n\n必要な詳細情報を追加する\n\n曖昧な表現を具体化する\n\n条件や制約を適切に設定する 足りない情報がある場合は、質問して補完してください。情報がそろったら修正案を提示してください。」\n\n5.4 日本人向けプロンプト作成ガイドラインの提案\n\n生成AIを効果的に活用するためには、日本語の特性を理解したうえで、具体的かつ明確なプロンプトを作成することが重要です。日本語は文脈依存が強く、主語や目的語を省略する傾向があるため、そのままでは生成AIが意図を正確に汲み取れない場合があります。これを解決するには、生成AIに伝わりやすいプロンプト作成のガイドラインを確立し、それに基づいて設計を行うことが有効です。\n\n以下では、日本人が生成AIを活用する際に意識すべきプロンプト作成のガイドラインとその具体例を示します。\n\nガイドライン1: 具体的な指示を心がける\n\nAIに対して曖昧な指示を避け、タスクや対象を具体的に記述します。\n\n曖昧なプロンプト： 「これを整理してください。」\n\n→ どのデータをどのように整理するかが不明瞭。\n\n→ どのデータをどのように整理するかが不明瞭。 改善例：「会議資料の売上データを地域別に分類し、グラフを作成してください。」\n\n→ データの対象、分類方法、出力形式が明示されています。\n\nガイドライン2: 出力形式を指定する\n\nAIが生成する結果がどのような形式であるべきかを指定します。\n\n曖昧なプロンプト： 「この内容をまとめてください。」\n\n→ 要約の範囲や形式が不明瞭。\n\n→ 要約の範囲や形式が不明瞭。 改善例：「このレポートの要点を箇条書きで3つ挙げてください。」\n\n→ 要点の数（3つ）と形式（箇条書き）が具体的です。\n\nガイドライン3: 背景情報を適切に補足する\n\nAIが文脈を理解できるように、必要な背景情報を含めます。\n\n曖昧なプロンプト： 「これについて説明してください。」\n\n→ 「これ」が具体的に何を指すか不明。\n\n→ 「これ」が具体的に何を指すか不明。 改善例：「マーケティングレポート第3章の内容を簡単に説明してください。」\n\n→ 対象（マーケティングレポート第3章）が明示されています。\n\nガイドライン4: タスクを段階的に分割する\n\n複数のタスクを一度に指示するのではなく、段階ごとに分けて伝えることで解釈の精度を高めます。\n\n曖昧なプロンプト： 「このデータを分析して改善案を出してください。」\n\n→ 分析内容や改善案の範囲が不明。\n\n→ 分析内容や改善案の範囲が不明。 改善例：「最初に、添付の売上データから地域ごとのトレンドを分析してください。その後、改善案を2つ提案してください。」\n\n→ タスク（分析と提案）が段階的に示されています。\n\nガイドライン5: 曖昧さを排除しつつ柔軟性を保つ\n\n日本語の丁寧な表現を活かしながら、AIが解釈しやすい具体的な言葉を選ぶことが重要です。\n\n曖昧なプロンプト： 「可能であれば対応してください。」\n\n→ 必須なのか任意なのか不明。\n\n→ 必須なのか任意なのか不明。 改善例：「このタスクを本日中に対応してください。」\n\n→ 必要な行動と期限が明確。\n\n日本人向けガイドラインを活用するメリット\n\nこれらのガイドラインを活用することで、生成AIの応答精度を向上させ、意図した結果を得られる可能性が高まります。特に日本語の曖昧さや文脈依存を補う工夫は、生成AIの誤解を防ぎ、応答の品質を安定させる効果があります。\n\nたとえば、以下のような違いが見られます。\n\n曖昧なプロンプト： 「このデータについてどう思いますか？」\n\n→ AIが解釈に迷い、漠然とした応答が返る可能性。\n\n→ AIが解釈に迷い、漠然とした応答が返る可能性。 改善されたプロンプト：「2023年第1四半期の売上データを分析し、前年比での変動要因を特定してください。」\n\n→ AIが明確なタスクに基づいて応答を生成できる。\n\n日本語プロンプト作成における注意点\n\n具体性を優先する：AIが推測を行わなくても済むように、曖昧さを排除する。 背景情報を補足する：AIが文脈を理解できるように適切な情報を提供する。 目的に応じた形式を指定する：結果の形式や期待する内容を具体的に示す。\n\nこれらのガイドラインを実践することで、日本語の特性を活かしつつ、生成AIを最大限に活用するプロンプトを作成することが可能になります。\n\n6.

We're not sure — but the product is", "fullContent": "Since late 2024, social media users have spread a supposedly real vintage advertisement for scotch- and bourbon-flavored toothpaste.\n\nThe image of the ad spread on Reddit, Facebook and X. It read: \"SPIKED TOOTHPASTE — SCOTCH OR BOURBON FLAVORED…Put some 'spirit' in your brushing! Real, honest to goodness whiskey in toothpaste.\" The allegedly authentic ad also joked that the toothpaste will get men to brush their teeth \"3, 4, even 5 times daily.\" Some internet users said the ad brought to mind pop star Kesha's 2009 song \"TiK ToK,\" which includes a lyric about the singer brushing her teeth with Jack Daniel's whiskey.\n\nAccording to many of these posts, a man named Don Poynter invented the product in the 1950s.\n\nAlthough it was unclear whether this particular advertisement was authentic, whiskey-flavored toothpaste was, in fact, a real product sold to consumers. Poynter, a novelty inventor from Cincinnati, Ohio, is widely credited with creating the product in the mid-1950s — but there is some evidence boozy toothpaste existed even earlier.\n\nHave more information on this topic? Send us a tip.\n\nThe history of whiskey toothpaste\n\nSnopes could not find proof that the specific advertisement shown above appeared in vintage newspapers. Neither could Cincinnati Public Library researcher Jessie Ludwig, who said via email she could not find the exact ad referenced in the claims — but \"it is safe to say that it was a real product.\"\n\nThat's because advertisements marketing whiskey-flavored toothpaste as a novelty gift item appeared in a wide variety of newspapers in the mid-1950s. \"Taste it! Smell it! There's real whiskey in this toothpaste!\" proclaimed one 1955 Cincinnati Enquirer ad selling the toothpaste for $1.50 a tube.\n\nAnother authentic ad that appeared in the Austin American-Statesman in 1956 used a similar tagline to that of the purported ad: \"A sure way to make him brush his teeth three, four, or even five times a day!\" the real ad, available on historical archive Newspapers.com, said. \"Cleans teeth, too!\"\n\nAn authentic ad for whiskey toothpaste in the June 15, 1956, issue of the Austin American-Statesman. (Newspapers.com)\n\nMany of the ads said the tubes came in three flavors — bourbon, scotch and rye — and were \"6 proof,\" meaning they contained 3% alcohol by volume. The product became popular enough, in fact, that an Iowa state representative reportedly tried to ban it.\n\nPoynter launched his version of the product \"around 1954,\" per an interview with the University of Cincinnati's UC Magazine, but the earliest mention of \"whiskey toothpaste\" we found comes from a story printed in at least three newspapers in 1937. In all three instances, the story described an incident in which a local health officer tracked down a salesman who was allegedly selling whiskey-flavored toothpaste to children in Burbank, California.\n\nA public patent search returned no results for a whiskey-flavored toothpaste patent owned by Poynter, although it did return patents on various other novelty items he created.\n\nStill, it is clear Poynter popularized the product; a search of Newspapers.com found no additional stories or advertisements about whiskey toothpaste until the 1950s. Numerous articles from around that era credited Poynter with the invention, including papers from Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts.\n\nLife magazine even published a story on the boozy tubes in 1955. Although the text of the article did not appear to be available online, images from the story are available in Life's photo collection.\n\nThe Cincinnati Museum Center reportedly has some of Poynter's whiskey toothpaste, as does at least one private collector: Guinness World Records, in 2023, determined that an American dentist holds the world's largest toothpaste collection — and that his favorite tubes are \"a set of three whisky-flavoured ones (rye, scotch, and bourbon), manufactured by Don Poynter in the 1950s.\"\n\nPoynter died in 2021 at age 96. His obituary in The Wall Street Journal called whiskey-flavored toothpaste \"one of his best ideas.\""}

Trent Alexander-Arnold, still easing back from a lengthy injury layoff, climbed off the bench to net a dramatic winner against Leicester City. That goal, sealing a 2-1 victory, means the Reds now stand just one win away from reclaiming the Premier League title.\n\nBut beyond the headlines and the scoreline lies a deeper narrative—one of uncertainty, loyalty, and a stirring show of leadership from Liverpool’s captain, Virgil van Dijk.\n\nWith Arsenal’s 4-0 dismantling of Ipswich keeping the pressure on, Arne Slot’s side know they can lift the trophy on home turf this Sunday. Tottenham Hotspur, the visitors, won’t make it easy. But the real subplot is what lies ahead for some of Liverpool’s biggest stars—none more so than Alexander-Arnold.\n\nVan Dijk Defends Liverpool Teammate Amid Transfer Speculation\n\nFor months now, speculation has swirled around the long-term futures of Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, and Trent Alexander-Arnold. The former two have now put pen to paper on two-year contract extensions. The latter, however, remains an enigma. Strong links to Real Madrid refuse to die down, and whispers persist that a deal may already be in place.\n\nSome sections of the Liverpool faithful have reacted emotionally to the prospect of losing a local lad, a product of the club’s academy and one of the game’s most creative full-backs. But Van Dijk, ever the voice of calm and perspective, made sure to put things into focus after the Leicester match.\n\n“Whatever may happen in the future for him, that’s something that he has to resolve with himself and the family, but he’s a Liverpool player at this point and he’s important for our team,” Van Dijk said post-match.\n\nThe Dutchman’s words were as clear as they were emphatic. “He has been important throughout the whole season and today again he came back from the injury, a long one, and that’s what I’m happy about… Since I joined the club, he has been a fantastic player and there’s a lot of good things that he will always be remembered for if he decides to leave.”\n\nMoments Not to be Taken for Granted\n\nThere’s something poignant about Alexander-Arnold’s celebration—a bare-chested sprint toward the Liverpool end, passion etched across his face. If this is to be one of his final acts in red, it’s one that captures everything Liverpool fans love about him: drive, emotion, and that uncanny knack for delivering when it matters most.\n\nVan Dijk wasn’t done. “Listen, at this point we don’t know as a group what’s going to happen. There’s a lot of noise around him and obviously everyone can argue if it’s his own fault, it’s just part of life nowadays. When he scores a big goal like that, I think he deserves applause… these are moments which you shouldn’t take for granted to give us as a team the opportunity on Sunday to finish it off.”\n\nIt’s not just sentiment. These comments strike at the heart of modern football—where careers pivot on moments, and where clubs must navigate the fine line between legacy and future planning.\n\nCommitment questioned? Not on Slot’s watch\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot echoed Van Dijk’s sentiments, making it crystal clear where he stands on Alexander-Arnold’s dedication.\n\n“What I can say is, it would be ridiculous if someone argues about his commitment for his club because of the work rate he put in to be back today and make such an important goal, and all the work he’s done for his club in all these years that he’s here,” Slot stated. “No one should, in my opinion, argue his commitment to this club.”\n\nAlexander-Arnold himself was more reserved, choosing not to be drawn into talk of his future. But he did admit that “scoring goals, winning games, being close to winning titles,” are “special moments that will live with me forever.”\n\nAnd if Sunday does indeed end in glory, it may prove to be the perfect curtain call—or another chapter—in Alexander-Arnold’s Liverpool story. Either way, Van Dijk’s message is clear: enjoy the moment, because it may never come again in quite the same way."}

No manual curation, no human narration, just seamless AI magic. Sounds like the future? It's happening now, powered by MongoDB and generative AI.\n\nIn 2025, the demand for audio content—particularly podcasts—surged, with 9 million new active listeners in the United States alone, prompting news organizations to seek efficient ways to deliver daily summaries to their audiences. However, automating news delivery has proven to be a challenging task, as media outlets must manage dynamic article data and convert this information into high-quality audio formats at scale.\n\nTo overcome these hurdles, media organizations can use MongoDB for data storage alongside generative AI for podcast creation, developing a scalable solution for automated news broadcasting. This approach unlocks new AI-driven business opportunities and can attract new customers while strengthening the loyalty of existing ones, contributing to increased revenue streams for media outlets.\n\nCheck out our AI Learning Hub to learn more about building AI-powered apps with MongoDB.\n\nThe secret sauce: MongoDB + AI\n\nIn a news automation solution, MongoDB acts as the system’s backbone, storing news article information as flexible documents with fields like title, content, and publication date—all within a single collection. Alongside this, dynamic elements (such as the number of qualified reads) can be seamlessly integrated into the same document to track content popularity.\n\nMoreover, derived insights—e.g., sentiment analysis and key entities—can be generated and enriched through a gen AI pipeline directly within the existing collection.\n\nFigure 1. MongoDB data storage for media.\n\nThis adaptable data structure ensures that the system remains both efficient and scalable, regardless of content diversity or evolving features. As a result, media outlets have created a robust framework to query and extract the latest news and metadata from MongoDB. They can now integrate AI with advanced language models to transform this information into an audio podcast. With this foundation in place, let's examine why MongoDB is well-suited for implementing AI-driven applications.\n\nWhy MongoDB is the perfect fit\n\nNews data is inherently diverse, with each article containing a unique mix of attributes, including main content fields (e.g. id, title, body, date, imageURL), calculated meta data (e.g. read count), generated fields with the help of GenAI (e.g. keywords, sentiment) and embeddings for semantic/vector search. Some of these elements originate from publishers, while others emerge from user interactions or AI-driven analysis. MongoDB’s flexible document model accommodates all these attributes—whether predefined or dynamically generated, within a single, adaptable structure. This eliminates the rigidity of traditional databases and ensures that the system evolves seamlessly alongside the data it manages.\n\nWhat’s more, speed is critical in news automation. By storing complete, self-contained documents, MongoDB enables rapid retrieval and processing without the need for complex joins. This efficiency allows articles to be enriched, analyzed, and transformed into audio content in near real-time.\n\nAnd scalability is built in. Whether handling a small stream of updates or processing vast amounts of constantly changing data, MongoDB’s distributed architecture ensures high availability and seamless growth, making it ideal for large-scale media applications.\n\nLast but hardly least, developers benefit from MongoDB’s agility. Without the constraints of fixed schemas, new data points—whether from evolving AI models, audience engagement metrics, or editorial enhancements—can be integrated effortlessly. This flexibility allows teams to experiment, iterate, and scale without friction, ensuring that the system remains future-proof as news consumption evolves.\n\nFigure 2. MongoDB benefits for AI-driven applications.\n\nBringing news to life with generative AI\n\nSelecting MongoDB for database storage is just the beginning; the real magic unfolds when text meets AI-powered speech synthesis. In our labs, we have experimented with Google’s NotebookLM model to refine news text, ensuring smooth narration with accurate intonation and pacing.\n\nPutting all these pieces together, the diagram below illustrates the workflow for automating AI-based news summaries into audio conversions.\n\nFigure 3. AI-based text-to-audio conversion architecture.\n\nThe process begins with a script that retrieves relevant news articles from MongoDB, using the Aggregation Framework and Vector Search to ensure semantic relevance. These selected articles are then passed through an AI-powered pipeline, where they are condensed into a structured podcast script featuring multiple voices. Once the script is refined, advanced text-to-speech models transform it into high-quality audio, which is stored as a .wav file. To optimize delivery, the generated podcast is cached, ensuring seamless playback for users on demand. The result? A polished, human-like narration, ready for listeners in MP3 format.\n\nThanks to this implementation, media outlets can finally let go of the robotic voices of past automations. Instead, they can now deliver a listening experience to their customers that's human, engaging, and professional.\n\nThe future of AI-powered news consumption\n\nThis system isn’t just a technological innovation; it’s a revolution in how we consume news. By combining MongoDB’s efficiency with AI’s creative capabilities, media organizations can deliver personalized, real-time news summaries without human intervention. It’s faster, smarter, and scalable—ushering in a new era of automated audio content.\n\nWant to build the next-gen AI-powered media platform?

In an article published in 2018, Aqualus Gordon at the University of Central Missouri explained that men feel shame around a number of factors related to their sexuality, including how much they masturbate or watch pornography, whether they are sexually experienced enough, or skilled enough lovers, and whether their bodies are desirable. Sexual shame in men, Gordon warns, is linked to severe psychological distress, including depression, addiction, sexual dysfunction, and social isolation.\n\nScholars of sexual shame say men are as susceptible to shame as women are, and in some ways more. Why? Because men are not “guaranteed” masculinity at puberty, researchers hypothesize. They have to continue to earn it.\n\nIf that is the case, what do young men and boys believe they have to do to earn this coveted masculinity card?\n\nThe Role of Sexual Shame in Violence\n\nAs a researcher, I interview people from around the world to learn about their sexuality, past and present. In a highly illuminating conversation, one male interviewee shared with me how young men in his community talk about sex with women, regularly using terms like “crush,\" “hurt,\" and \"tear her up.\" This is not necessarily news to us, but we’ve become so desensitized to this language that we ignore how appallingly violent it is.\n\nYet boys in many parts of the world receive messages like, \"If you bang your woman hard, you’re a real man.\" This link between sexual shame and sexual aggression is found in academic literature as well. In 2014, researchers Mescher and Rudman published a study revealing that men feel shame when they internalize and believe they fall short of commonly accepted masculine body ideals around things like height, muscularity or leanness. They explain that men who are high on such body shame (a factor that correlates highly with sexual shame) tend to be more hostile, to react to rejection more negatively and to be more prone to violence toward women and rape proclivity, defined as “the self-reported likelihood that a man would commit a sexually aggressive act, like forcing sex, under certain hypothetical conditions, especially if he were assured that there would be no consequences.\" It appears that when some men feel threatened or rejected due a perceived inadequacy around their masculinity or physicality, they may resort to sexual aggression as a maladaptive way to exert power, the authors suggest.\n\nSure enough, as Adolescence progresses, we get a glimpse into the protagonist Jamie's struggles with his perceptions of his own inadequacy.\n\nTo be clear: I am not justifying violence toward anyone because someone feels unloved or undesired, nor I am suggesting that sexual shame is the only reason some men act out violently. I am pointing out, however, that we have a scientifically-proven correlation between feelings of inadequacy and sexual aggression in some boys and men that is worth considering and exploring as we try to unpack how to make our communities safer and more nurturing for all of their members.\n\nIs Technology to Blame?\n\nIn a recent post on AI companionship, I made the claim that the worse your human relationships, and the better your technology, the more likely you are to form an addictive and potentially harmful bond with your device/app/chatbot.\n\nWhen it comes to boys, technology, and what I’m now calling “The Adolescence Effect,\" I believe this correlation also applies.\n\nThose who have pointed out that lonely, maladapted men have always been prone to extreme and antisocial behaviors, and so this is not a new pattern, are right. But the risk here is more elevated because while our technology becomes more sophisticated, pervasive, and ubiquitous, our human relationships may have just gotten worse.\n\nIf you are a 14-year-old boy who has been bullied, rejected, or made to feel not masculine enough, with no safe and trusted avenues to process these emotions, where will you go when you pick up your smartphone? Wherever that child chooses to go, algorithms will reinforce that direction, in spades.\n\nMan in the Mirror\n\nBeing desired and being rejected is part of the gamut of human relationships, but if we shy away from these conversations and from modeling healthy relationships to our children, they will find a way to fill the void. In today's digital age, they will turn to their technological tools for information and validation.\n\nOn the other hand, if we offer our boys strong and unconditional social support and communities and safe and open environments in which to learn to accept and express themselves, and also demand of them social accountability and responsibility, then, research suggests, they will be better inoculated against anti-social influences, both online and off.\n\nAnother one of my male interviewees made the poignant observation that the only opportunity boys have for intimacy is sex, and therefore many of them engage in sexual behaviors before they are emotionally ready. Are we willing to offer them other opportunities for intimacy without calling them weak or soft? This shift requires a level of self-reflection and vulnerability I am not sure we have the stomach for as a society. But as Adolescence shows us, we may have no choice.\n\nJapanese roboticist and philosophical engineer Hiroshi Ishiguro has said, “We see ourselves in the mirror of the machines we can build.\"\n\nIf we don’t like what’s being reflected back, we have to change it, one mirror at a time."}

Be thankful for the lessons. Take them and make the best of things today.\n\nFor my 18th birthday, many moons ago, my grandfather on my mom’s side gave me four lightly-used flannel shirts that he no longer needed. The shirts were barely worn and in great shape; my grandfather said he thought they would look great on me. Unfortunately, I thought they were odd gifts at the time and I wasn’t thankful. I looked at him skeptically, gave him a crooked half-smile, and moved on to the other gifts sitting in front of me. My grandfather died two days later from a sudden heart attack. The flannel shirts were the last gifts he ever gave me, and that crooked half-smile was the last time I directly acknowledged him. Today, I still regret the little thing I didn’t say when I had the chance: “Thank you Grandpa. I appreciate you.”\n\nThat was a huge wake-up call for me — one that has served me well for over two decades now.\n\nAnd here are eight wake-up calls for all of us to reflect on today — some important lessons worth learning and living by, before it’s too late:\n\n1. We might not have tomorrow to say, “I love you.”\n\nAbout 15 years ago a coworker of mine died in a car accident on the way to work. During his funeral several people from the office were in tears, saying kind things like: “I loved him. We all loved him so much. He was such a wonderful person.” I started crying too, and I wondered if these people had told him that they loved him while he was alive, or whether it was only with death that this powerful word, love, had been used without question or hesitation.\n\nI vowed to myself then and there that I would never again hesitate to speak up to the people I love and remind them of how much I appreciate them. They deserve to know they give meaning to my life. They deserve to know I think the world of them.\n\nBottom line: If you love someone today, tell them. If you appreciate someone today, tell them. There might not be a tomorrow. Today is the day to express your love and admiration. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in detail in the Relationships chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)\n\n2. Our judgments of others are often inaccurate.\n\nYou will never know exactly what another person is going through or what their whole story is. When you believe you do, realize that your assumptions about their life are in direct relation to your own limited perspective.\n\nMany people you believe to be successful are extremely unhappy. Many people you think have it easy have worked their tail off to achieve their status. Many people who appear to be wealthy are in debt because of their extravagant tastes for material possessions. Many people who appear to be too old and uncool were once every bit as young, hip, and inexperienced as you are right now.\n\n3. Not trying is why most people fail in the long run.\n\nIt’s not the mistakes and failures you have to worry about the most, it’s the opportunities you miss when you don’t even try that hurt the worst. Trying — truly trying — always leads to some level of success, regardless of the outcome. Even mistakes and failures teach you what not to do next time. Every outcome, good or bad, is a lesson that makes you stronger and wiser over time.\n\nSo keep reminding yourself that in the end there’s only one thing that makes a goal or dream impossible to achieve: the failure to try. Because the results you achieve in life are not based on what you plan to do or what you say you’ll do. Your results come from what you actually try and do consistently!\n\nYes, your life will get better when YOU get better. Start investing in yourself mentally and physically. Make it a priority to learn and grow a little bit every day by building positive daily habits and sticking to them. The stronger you grow and become, the better your life will feel in the long run.\n\n4. Patience doesn’t mean waiting and doing nothing.\n\nPatience involves productive activity. It means doing your very best with the resources available to you, while understanding that the results you seek are worth the required time and effort, and not available elsewhere for any less time and effort.\n\nPatience is the realization that the quality of your life in the long run is much more significant than the quantity of things you fill it with today. Patience is your willingness to accept and appreciate what you have right now, while you gradually work hard for the dreams and goals that matter most to you.\n\n5. Most of us don’t need to buy anything more to be happy.\n\nIntuitively, you already know that the best stuff in life isn’t stuff at all, and that relationships, experiences, and meaningful work are the staples of a happy life. Yet you live in a consumer driven society where your mind is incessantly subjected to clever advertising ploys that drive you, against your better judgment, to buy material goods you don’t need or even want.\n\nAnd at a certain point, the excessive material objects you buy end up hurting the emotional needs advertisers would like you to believe they are meant to support. So next time you’re getting ready to make an impulsive purchase, ask yourself if this thing is really better than the things you already have. Or have you been momentarily tricked into believing that you’re dissatisfied with what you already have? (Read “Soulful Simplicity”.)\n\n6. None of us are perfect.\n\nAll humans are imperfect. We make mistakes, we lose our tempers, and we get caught off guard. We stumble, we slip, and we spin out of control sometimes. Yes, sometimes the confident lose confidence, the patient misplace their patience, the generous act selfish, and the knowledgeable second guess what they know.\n\nBut that’s honestly the worst of it — we all have our moments. Most of the time we are remarkable! So stand beside the people you love through their trying times of imperfection, and offer yourself the same courtesy; if you aren’t willing to, you don’t deserve to be around for the remarkable moments either.\n\n7. All the little things make a big difference in the end.\n\nLife isn’t about a single moment of great triumph and attainment. It’s about the trials and errors that get you there — the blood, sweat, and tears — the small, inconsequential things you do every day. It all matters in the end — every step, every regret, every decision, and every little affliction.\n\nYes, the seemingly useless happenings add up to something. The minimum wage job you had in high school. The evenings you spent laughing and socializing with coworkers you never see anymore. The hours you spent writing down your thoughts on social media posts no one ever read. Contemplations about elaborate future plans that never came to be. All those lonely nights spent reading novels and news columns and Twitter threads and fashion tips and questioning your own principles on life and sex and religion and whether or not you’re good enough just the way you are…\n\nAll of this has strengthened you! All of this has led you to every success you’ve ever had. All of this has made you who you are today.\n\nTruth be told, you’ve been broken down dozens of times and put yourself back together again. Think about how remarkable that is, and how far you have come. You’re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or even yesterday. You’re always growing… stronger!\n\n8. Excuses are mostly just lies.\n\nJust because someone else can, doesn’t mean you can, right? Because you’re not good enough, or you’ve already missed your chance, or it’s just not in the cards for you. You look for reasons they can do it but you can’t…\n\n“Maybe he’s an internet entrepreneur and freelance writer because he has no kids.”\n\n“Maybe she’s way fitter than I am because she doesn’t have all the work and family obligations I have, or has a more supportive spouse, or doesn’t have bad knees.”\n\nOK fine, it’s easy to find excuses: but look at all the other people who also have considerable obstacles and have done it anyway. Angel and I have a family, and have coped with significant loss in our lives, and still managed to make meaningful progress in our lives. And just as we’ve turned things around for ourselves, we know hundreds of other people who’ve done the same. Through 15 years of work with our coaching clients and live event attendees, we’ve witnessed people reinventing themselves at all ages — 48-year olds starting healthy families, 57-year-olds graduating from college for the first time, 71-year-olds starting successful businesses, and so forth. And stories abound of people with disabilities or illnesses who overcame their obstacles to achieve incredible outcomes.\n\nNo one else can succeed for you on your behalf. The life you live is the life you build for yourself. There are so many possibilities to choose from, and so many opportunities for you to bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be. NOW is the moment to actually step forward!\n\nIt’s your turn…\n\nStarting now, I sincerely hope you will have an inspired rest of your day today, that you will dream boldly and dangerously, that you will make some progress that didn’t exist before you took action, that you will love and be loved in return, and that you will find the strength to accept and grow from the troubles you can’t change. And, most importantly (because Angel and I think there should be more kindness and wisdom in this world), that you will, when you must, be wise with your decisions, and that you will always be extra kind to yourself and others.\n\nAnd before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂\n\n(Finally, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week.)"}

While it may not introduce innovative changes, this release focuses on improving usability, customization, and accessibility. Expected to launch in May following a series of beta releases, iOS 18.5 is designed to make your daily interactions with your device smoother and more efficient. Here’s an in-depth look at the features you can expect in a new video from iReviews.\n\n1. Smarter Back Tap Notifications\n\nThe Back Tap feature, which allows you to assign specific actions to double or triple taps on the back of your iPhone, is receiving a thoughtful enhancement. A new banner notification will now appear whenever Back Tap is activated, helping you identify accidental triggers. This small yet practical addition ensures you’re always aware of when the feature is in use. For added convenience, you can toggle this notification on or off in the Accessibility settings, giving you greater control over your device interactions.\n\n2. Enhanced Mail App Features\n\nManaging your emails is about to become more intuitive with updates to the Mail app. You’ll now have the option to enable or disable contact photos directly from the app’s menu, allowing for a cleaner and more personalized inbox view. Additionally, a new “All Mail” category consolidates all your inboxes into a single unified space. This streamlined approach simplifies navigation, making it easier to stay on top of your emails without switching between accounts.\n\n3. Streamlined Apple Care Access\n\nAccessing Apple Care details is now more straightforward than ever. With iOS 18.5, you can view warranty information, repair options, and eligibility for extended coverage directly within your device settings. A quick link to the Apple Support app is also included, making sure you have easy access to assistance whenever you need it. This update eliminates the need to search for support information, saving you time and effort.\n\n4. Improved Screen Time Management\n\nApple’s Screen Time feature is receiving several updates to help you better monitor and manage device usage. You’ll now have the ability to customize notifications for weekly reports and other alerts, making it easier to stay informed about your screen habits. A new consolidated “Screen Time Management” section simplifies the process of adjusting settings, particularly for managing children’s devices. These enhancements are designed to give you greater control over how you and your family use your devices, promoting healthier digital habits.\n\n5. Revamped Recently Deleted Folder\n\nRecovering deleted files is becoming more efficient with updates to the Recently Deleted folder. This folder, which temporarily stores removed content, will reintroduce “Recover All” and “Delete All” buttons in the public release. Initially tested during the beta phase, these features provide a quicker way to manage deleted files, saving you time and effort when recovering or permanently removing content.\n\n6. Satellite Messaging for the UK\n\nFor users in the UK, iOS 18.5 introduces satellite messaging support. This feature enables you to send messages in areas without cellular or Wi-Fi coverage, making sure connectivity in remote locations. While currently limited to specific regions, this technology represents a significant step forward in maintaining communication wherever you are. It’s particularly useful for outdoor enthusiasts, travelers, or anyone who frequently finds themselves in areas with limited network access.\n\n7. Release Timeline\n\nThe iOS 18.5 update is currently in its beta testing phase, with the third beta expected to roll out on April 21. Following four beta stages, the public release is anticipated around May 12. This timeline allows Apple to fine-tune the update and address any issues before its official launch, making sure a smooth rollout for users.\n\nWhy iOS 18.5 Matters\n\nWhile iOS 18.5 doesn’t introduce new innovations, its focus on refining existing features and improving usability makes it a meaningful update. Here’s a closer look at what it brings to the table:\n\nSmarter Back Tap notifications for better control and awareness.\n\nfor better control and awareness.

Whether it’s the small quality-of-life improvements or the expanded connectivity options, this update is designed to enhance your daily interactions with your device.

Here's what we know", "fullContent": "A rumor that users circulated online in April 2025 claimed Rachel Accurso, better known to children worldwide as the wildly popular YouTube educational star Ms. Rachel, filed a lawsuit against comedian and creator Druski over a video parodying her famous character.\n\nFor example, beginning on or just before April 9, numerous users posting on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube spread the rumor about Accurso either already suing or intending to sue Druski — whose real name is Drew Desbordes — for portraying her in his video.\n\nHowever, as of April 21, we located no evidence of a lawsuit between Accurso and Druski. Searches for articles from news media outlets on Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo, as well as court records in each party's state of residence, found no information about any legal proceedings involving the pair, indicating the rumor was unfounded. The rumor possibly originated from popular comments under Druski's video claiming Accurso might sue him, with some users misinterpreting the remarks as a lawsuit already being in the works.\n\nSeveral representatives for Creative Artists Agency, the company representing Accurso, have not responded to emails requesting comment and asking whether the rumor is true. Druski's teams at United Talent Agency and his 4LIFERS entertainment company have yet to reply to the same inquiry.\n\nAccurso and her husband, Aron Accurso, an associate musical director and associate conductor for the Broadway musical \"Aladdin,\" have created hundreds of videos amassing billions of views for their series of children's educational videos titled \"Songs for Littles.\" A Parents.com article from 2024 reported the pair lives in New York City. They both welcomed their second child earlier in 2025. Meanwhile, Druski has millions of followers on his social media accounts, mostly on Instagram and TikTok. Forbes reported he resides in Atlanta.\n\nHow the Ms. Rachel-Druski rumor originated\n\nOn April 7, Druski posted the in-question video to his social media pages on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X and YouTube — in total receiving around 50 million views. The clip, captioned \"Those Kids shows Behind the Scenes,\" featured Druski alongside a female actor parodying Ms. Rachel.\n\nThe video depicted the female actor wearing clothing much like Ms. Rachel's signature outfit of a pink shirt, overalls, ponytail and pink headband. The video also displayed the Ms. Rachel program logo with a trademark symbol, as well as a song about counting numbers matching that of an audio track of an official Ms. Rachel video.\n\nIn Druski's parody clip, he and the female actor name letters of the alphabet, including \"A is for apple,\" \"B is for bus\" and \"C is for cat.\" Then, taking a break on the set, Druski smacks the female actor on her butt. The video further features Druski saying vulgar words and engaging in drug use. The clip does not depict the female actor making vulgar remarks or using drugs.\n\nOne of the top TikTok comments receiving 160,000 likes read, \"L is for LLLLAWSUIT, Ms. Rachel don't play about her name.\" Another comment with 108,000 likes read, \"LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO s is for sued. Sued. Sued. Sued.\" Some users may have misinterpreted these and other popular comments, wrongly believing they meant Accurso sued Druski — one possible explanation for the origination of the unfounded rumor.\n\nQuestioning the lawsuit claim\n\nAfter users began sharing the rumor that Accurso sued Druski for his video, some other users questioned the claim.\n\nFor example, one popular video creator broke down the rumor, saying, \"Now, the problem arises with how some people took the skit. They saw it as an insult to Ms. Rachel, cause you know he's doing wild things behind the scenes. And the skit allegedly references Ms. Rachel. Now here's where things start to get wicked. The internet starts going wild saying, 'Ooo, Ms. Rachel's suing Druski. Ms. Rachel's suing Druski.' But I couldn't find anything that said Ms. Rachel was actually suing Druski.\"\n\nAnother TikTok user said in a video, \"The 'Ms. Rachel suing Druski' thing has to be fake,\" citing parody law. On X, a different user similarly added, \"Everybody said Ms. Rachel suing Druski except for Rachel her damn self.\"\n\nRegarding parody law, Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute published, in part, \"In the United States, parody is protected by the First Amendment as a form of expression. However, since parodies rely heavily on the original work, parodists rely on the fair use exception to combat claims of copyright infringement.\"\n\nWe will update this story if any further developments occur."}

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd's (KLSE:MUHIBAH) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.027 = RM62m ÷ (RM3.6b - RM1.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nSo, Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd has an ROCE of 2.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Construction industry average of 10.0%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd\n\nKLSE:MUHIBAH Return on Capital Employed April 21st 2025\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd .\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nEven though ROCE is still low in absolute terms, it's good to see it's heading in the right direction. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 2.7%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 27% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nOn a related note, the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets has decreased to 37%, which basically reduces it's funding from the likes of short-term creditors or suppliers. This tells us that Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd has. Given the stock has declined 40% in the last five years, this could be a good investment if the valuation and other metrics are also appealing. With that in mind, we believe the promising trends warrant this stock for further investigation."}

(NASDAQ:INTA)?", "fullContent": "While Intapp, Inc. (NASDAQ:INTA) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$74.10 and falling to the lows of US$50.01. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Intapp's current trading price of US$51.51 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Intapp’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nWe check all companies for important risks. See what we found for Intapp in our free report.\n\nWhat Is Intapp Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Intapp seems to be fairly priced at around 0.04% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Intapp today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $51.49, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. In addition to this, Intapp has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Intapp\n\nCan we expect growth from Intapp?\n\nNasdaqGS:INTA Earnings and Revenue Growth April 21st 2025\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 21% over the next year, the near-term future seems bright for Intapp. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? INTA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on INTA, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop."}

We have done some analysis, and we found several positive factors beyond the profit numbers.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nCatalist:5TP Earnings and Revenue History April 21st 2025\n\nZooming In On CNMC Goldmine Holdings' Earnings\n\nOne key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio. To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\n\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nOver the twelve months to December 2024, CNMC Goldmine Holdings recorded an accrual ratio of -0.13. That implies it has good cash conversion, and implies that its free cash flow solidly exceeded its profit last year. In fact, it had free cash flow of US$15m in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of US$9.85m. CNMC Goldmine Holdings' free cash flow improved over the last year, which is generally good to see.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On CNMC Goldmine Holdings' Profit Performance\n\nAs we discussed above, CNMC Goldmine Holdings has perfectly satisfactory free cash flow relative to profit. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that CNMC Goldmine Holdings' statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Better yet, its EPS are growing strongly, which is nice to see. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for CNMC Goldmine Holdings you should be aware of."}
