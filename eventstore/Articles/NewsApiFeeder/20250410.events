But this is no ordinary manor. Its rooms--from twisting hallways and garden courtyards to sports facilities and curious dead ends--all reset at the start of each day. This leads to a fascinating roguelike mechanic, one where you need to create the best path to reach the fabled Room 46. Our Blue Prince guides hub has all the tips you need to help you get started with this deep dive into untold mysteries.\n\nBlue Prince guides hub\n\nOur Blue Prince guides hub is organized into several sections. We focused on individual puzzle rooms, followed by boons that you can unlock permanently. We also discuss progression--i.e. reaching the Antechamber and Room 46--as well as activities beyond that point. Naturally, these articles contain spoilers, so read them at your own risk.\n\nThe basics\n\nThese Blue Prince guides are all about the basics, such as the items that you might want for your runs and the resources that you need for continued exploration. We also mention a few tips about drafting rooms and advancing further into the estate.\n\nPuzzles and challenges\n\nTo be fair, Blue Prince has countless puzzles, including those that lead to even more secrets and cryptic clues. The ones that we've included here are those found in puzzle rooms. Some are fairly straightforward--i.e. logic and math--but others become more complex. There are even tasks with incremental difficulty increases if you complete them often.\n\nPasswords, safe codes, and locked containers\n\nIn some areas in the game, you need to learn the correct password or numerical combination just to earn some goodies. These Blue Prince guides focus on these particular tasks.\n\nPermanent upgrades\n\nOther puzzles, meanwhile, grant permanent upgrades. These include bonus gems, additional steps, and even a means of activating offline terminals. We've also included those that unlock new locations.\n\nProgression and exploration: The Antechamber, Room 46, and the Underground\n\nAs mentioned earlier, your main objective in Blue Prince is to reach Room 46, but that's easier said than done. Randomness--i.e. the RNG--won't always be in your favor. There are many challenges, as well as surprises that are both delightful and frustrating, that await you on your journey. Oh, and be forewarned that many of these guides contain spoilers.\n\nThe Manor\n\nThe Underground\n\nPost-campaign secrets and meta arcs: Spoiler-heavy guides\n\nWhile the above guides do contain spoilers, the ones in this section are on another level completely. You know the risk when you click on these spoilers. In any case, these are just a few of the activities that you can tackle well after your first visit to Room 46:\n\nThe Estate Grounds\n\nSanctum Key arc:\n\nCastle Cipher and Throne Room arc:\n\nNumeric Cores and Atelier arc:\n\nThere are numerous discoveries that await in this strange manor as you continue to play each day.

This period witnessed several key developments, including the retirement of Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey from the Board of Directors and a key CEO appointment. Despite reporting significant financial losses for 2024, new product launches such as the Xeon 6 processors provided positive momentum. The share price performance came amidst a challenging market environment, with the Nasdaq declining 6% largely due to a tech sell-off. Intel's moves during this time contrasted broader trends, with company-specific changes potentially bolstering investor sentiment.\n\nWe've discovered 1 warning sign for Intel that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nNasdaqGS:INTC Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Apr 2025\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 22 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nThe recent changes at Intel, such as the board reshuffle and CEO appointment, coupled with product launches like the Xeon 6 processors, have injected optimism, possibly boosting investor sentiment. Over the last year, however, the total shareholder return, including share price and dividends, declined 41.52%, contrasting with the 8.56% return of the US Semiconductor industry. These developments highlight Intel's challenges in a competitive landscape marked by new market entrants, especially in the AI PC category, which could affect its revenue and margin growth.\n\nIntel's long-term share performance has been underwhelming compared to the broader market. The share price change relative to its consensus price target of US$22.90 reflects some market skepticism, with Intel trading a slight discount of around 6%. Despite promising prospects, such as AI-driven innovations that may bolster revenue, analysts remain cautious about short-term revenue and earnings forecasts. Current market conditions, compounded by industry pressures, emphasize the importance of Intel delivering on new product timelines to improve financial health and market positioning.\n\nReview our historical performance report to gain insights into Intel's track record.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Now, Aqara says it’s bringing Advanced Matter Bridging to all its hubs, including the newer Camera Hub G5 Pro and older Zigbee-based models, including the Hub M2, Hub M1S/M1S Gen 2, Hub E1, and Camera Hub G3.\n\nBesides expanding support for its Advanced Matter Bridging functionality, Aqara is adding more than a dozen new Matter categories to its Aqara Home platform, including robot vacuums, dimmable plugs, smoke and CO alarms, smart curtains and shades, air conditioners and heat pumps, laundry washers and dryers, and leak, freeze, and rain sensors.\n\nWith those additions, Aqara now supports more than 50 Matter device types, the manufacturer said.\n\nAdvanced Matter Bridging will take some work on the part of users to expose Aqara’s more esoteric functionality to Matter.\n\nUsing the Aqara Home app, you’ll need to create a “signal” using one or more Aqara conditions–such as a camera recognizing a person’s face, or a door lock being opened by a specific fingerprint–and set those signals as triggers for virtual Matter devices.\n\nFor example, if an Aqara cam recognizes a person’s face, it could send an “Occupancy Detected” signal to a virtual Matter occupancy sensor, which could then activate a Philips Hue light automation.\n\nThis news story is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best smart home systems.\n\nIt’s a clever, if somewhat hack-y way to deal with one of Matter’s many rough edges, and it opens up numerous possibilities for integrating Aqara gear more deeply into Matter-enabled smart routines.\n\nAdvanced Matter Bridging will work on Aqara Matter controller bridges running firmware version 4.3.4, and you’ll need Aqara Home version 5.1.4 or better to access the feature."}

It’s designed for desktops, as its USB-C ports are unfortunately incapable of video.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence\r\n.\r\nContributor, PCWorld… [+5883 chars]", "title": "Need to surf the web anonymously? These 4 tools can help", "fullContent": "When you surf, you leave many different traces. For example, servers and web services store information about you in cookies and super-cookies. The more often you use a provider’s service, the more accurate their picture of you becomes. And the better the providers are networked with each other, the more information they have at their disposal to create surfing profiles.\n\nTake Amazon, for example. The web giant suggests articles to you based on previous searches. Your purchasing behavior or product research is always recorded and analyzed. This means you receive purchase suggestions in the form of advertising banners for products that you have previously searched for on another site. The data collection mania of web services can also be disadvantageous for you when it comes to dynamic pricing. The product price adapts to demand. This can mean that you end up paying a higher price.\n\nData slinger IP address\n\nThe biggest traitors are your browser and your IP address. The latter is automatically given when you surf so that the server with the website knows where to send its data. This is necessary, but anyone can use the IP address to find out at least your approximate location. We therefore present various ways in which you can surf the Internet as anonymously as possible.\n\nAnalyzing your IP address is only one of several identifiers that can be used to track you on the Internet. However, your IP address is the most important common feature that website operators and advertising providers can access. This is why IP address protection requires special attention when it comes to improving your privacy. This is where a virtual machine can be very useful.\n\nThe VM helps you to simply surf the net using a cloak of invisibility whenever you want to be as unrecognized as possible – for example when shopping online, searching for information or accessing private content. For everyday page views such as visiting news sites, streaming music and films, you don’t usually need the protective shield. You can carry out these activities without the VM on your host PC.\n\nDisguise the VM’s online data traffic with a VPN\n\nVPN providers such as Windscribe not only allow the use of an encrypted VPN connection, but also make it possible to bypass geo-IP blocks with corresponding servers. IDG\n\nA tried and tested means of travelling on the internet reasonably undetected is via a VPN tunnel (Virtual Private Network). Here, the data packets are not sent directly from your virtual machine to the target server, but are routed via a VPN server.\n\nThe advantage is that the log files of the servers visited do not store your IP address, but that of the VPN server. In addition, the data sent via a VPN tunnel is also encrypted, which makes it more difficult for third parties to intercept it.\n\nTo access the Internet with a stealth connection, all you need to do is install the software provided by the provider in the VM. We recommend the VPN services from Nord VPN, Cyberghost, and Surfshark. Windscribe is free with a volume of 10 GB per month.\n\nVPN providers usually not only enable IP masking, but also the circumvention of geo-IP blocks. Such measures are intended to prevent users from certain countries from using services — usually video streaming — that are either not available or only available to a limited extent in their countries.\n\nHowever, if you go online with your IP address, which identifies you as a user from Germany via a VPN server with a US IP address, you are considered an American for the target server.\n\nMore privacy when surfing\n\nIf the IP address of the PC is changed and disguised, you are not only cheating the advertising industry. Instead of one visitor accessing ten pages, you will appear in the server’s log files as ten visitors who have each accessed one page. The Tor Browser, which connects to the Tor network, is recommended for this. It disguises the actual IP address through intermediate proxy servers.\n\nThe packets no longer take the shortest route from you to their destination, but go via intermediate stations. The Tor node to which you are connected knows your IP address, the second and third nodes no longer do, and certainly not the destination server. The Tor network is structured in such a way that each intermediate station only knows the IP address of its predecessor. This makes it difficult to trace the sender of a packet.\n\nTor also has disadvantages. Depending on utilization, the surfing speed becomes significantly slower. Even an overloaded intermediate station can slow things down. And as with all networks, it can only be so secure as long as it is not compromised. After all, if surveillance agencies manage to spy on a Tor node, it is not possible to de-anonymize a user.\n\nSecure and anonymous with Tails\n\nTails is a live Linux system based on Debian that places particular emphasis on privacy and anonymity. To this end, Tails has the aforementioned, particularly secure Tor browser. In addition, there are other programs such as the e-mail client Thunderbird, the messenger Pidgin, the graphics programs Gimp, and Inkscape as well as the office package Libre Office.\n\nThree versions of Tails are available for download on the manufacturer’s website https://tails.net/. You can choose between a USB image for later use on USB data carriers, an ISO image for burning to DVD, and an ISO image for use in a virtual machine from Virtualbox or Vmware Workstation or Player."}

It brings that near-instant face unlock that’s become so convenient on phones to laptops, and desktops too if you get the right webcam. But if you like that effortless login, maybe hold back on the latest Windows update.\n\nMicrosoft says (via BleepingComputer) that due to a bug that affects an “edge case” of users, Windows Hello might not work after applying the update and running through some recovery settings. The problem affects both face unlock and PIN logins. Users shouldn’t be completely locked out of their PCs, so long as they can remember their Windows password, but it’s definitely a bit of a heart-stopper if you run into problems getting over that first hurdle.\n\nFortunately, the issue is indeed an edge case, as Microsoft says it only shows up after using the Settings > System > Recovery tool to reset your PC and keeping local files. And even then, it only happens if you enable System Guard Secure Launch or DRTM after applying the update. Once you get into Windows, possibly with the help of your password manager or a call to IT, you can set up Windows Hello face unlock again with a fresh face scan.\n\nThe update in question is Build 26100.3775, released on April 8th. This issue is no doubt frustrating if you encounter it, but it’s fairly unlikely given all those prerequisites, so I doubt Microsoft will be in a rush to fix it unless it starts affecting more widespread users."}

I’d choose an AI accountant or lawn-mower a hundred times over an AI artist or poet – so you can anticipate my satisfaction with companies like Lymow actually putting AI to good use with their autonomous lawn mower. This sleek machine embodies exactly what we should be asking of our technology – to handle mundane tasks we’d rather avoid. Let’s be honest, nobody wakes up on a Saturday morning excited to push a noisy, gas-guzzling contraption around their yard for hours. The Lymow One exists to give you that time back, handling the lawn while you handle… well, literally anything else you’d prefer to be doing.\n\nNow with over $5 million funded on Kickstarter (making it the No.1 robotic mower on the platform), Lymow highlighted its flagship mower at CES 2025, highlighting its unique mulching blades, which cut grass in a way that doesn’t leave clumps across your lawn. Instead, mulching benefits your lawn by giving it a layer of organic matter that naturally returns nutrients back to the soil, keeping it nourished. Hardly any robotic lawn mowers do this as effectively (with dual-blades and a high-speed fan to distribute the clippings) – which is what puts Lymow One ahead of the pack, coupled with its other game-changing features like its incredible battery that gives it 5x more coverage than other mowers, or the AI vision-assisted RTK satellite navigation system, or even the treaded tires that allow it to traverse across any terrain with ease.\n\nDesigner: Lymow\n\nClick Here to Buy Now: $1999 $2999 ($1000 off). Hurry, only 9/470 left! Raised over $5.1 million.\n\nThe Lymow One’s robust metal-enclosure aesthetic feels very ‘age of the robots’ but not in a scary way – in a way that empowers humans. The mower sports a predominantly monochrome exterior with black accents and bright red details that highlight its cutting mechanisms. However, the one detail that you’ll probably notice first is the absence of traditional wheels.\n\nInstead of regular wheels, the Lymow One goes for almost military-esque tank treads that definitely bestow an air of seriousness to the robot. The Lymow One uses those rugged, tank-like wheels to navigate rough, uneven terrain with ease. A pair of omnidirectional wheels on the front allow the mower to stay in sync with the terrain for highly consistent cutting. A brand representative claims it can clear obstacles up to 2 inches (50mm) high, handle slopes as steep as 45° (100% gradient), and even climb low steps. It’s also impressively efficient, capable of covering up to 1.73 acres (7000 m²) in a single day.\n\nThe Lymow One’s mulching capability really gives it a superior edge over other robot mowers. The LyCut dual blades don’t simply cut grass and discard it—they finely mulch clippings and distribute them evenly across your lawn with the help of two high-speed expel fans built into the cutting deck. This natural fertilization process returns valuable nutrients to your soil, promoting healthier grass growth while eliminating the need for bagging and disposal. The 6000 RPM powerful rotary blades effortlessly tackle all types of grass, including St. Augustine, Zoysia, Tall Fescue, and more—no matter how tough or dense the grass is.\n\nTechnically speaking, this mower is a powerhouse. It features a 528Wh super longevity LiFePO4 battery (15,000 mAh at 36V) that delivers impressive performance, covering approximately 25,000 square feet (2,300 m²) on a single charge. When the battery runs low, the Lymow One automatically returns to its charging dock, powers up in just 90 minutes to 90% capacity, and continues where it left off. The mower’s cutting system uses dual mulching blades spinning at 6,000 RPM with a 16-inch (405mm) cutting width that can be adjusted between heights of 1.2 to 4 inches (30-100mm), giving you precise control over your lawn’s appearance. You can even customize the stripe angle to achieve the perfect look for your lawn.\n\nUnlike older robotic mowers that require you to install boundary wires around your yard (a tedious weekend project in itself), the Lymow One uses its proprietary LySee Multi-Fusion Navigation System to help it create detailed maps of your property with centimeter-level precision and navigate with astonishing accuracy. By combining VSLAM with RTK satellite positioning, the navigation system ensures mowing stays uninterrupted even if there’s a temporary disruption from weather or obstacles. The mower combines this AI-powered binocular camera setup with input from five ultrasonic sensors, front bumpers, and off-ground detection mechanisms to detect obstacles, adjust for terrain changes, and optimize cutting patterns.\n\nThe companion app allows you to establish virtual boundaries, schedule mowing sessions, monitor progress in real-time, and even create custom zones with different cutting heights and stripe angles. Want your front yard cut to a pristine 1.5 inches but prefer the backyard a bit longer at 2.5 inches? A few taps in the app and it’s done. The software also provides maintenance reminders and updates itself automatically to improve performance over time.\n\nGPS tracking means you’ll always know where your mower is located. The Lymow One includes an anti-theft system that detects motion and triggers an alarm if someone attempts to move it without authorization. Additionally, the machine is PIN-protected through the app, rendering it useless if stolen.\n\nThe Lymow One carries an IPX6 rating, meaning it can handle rainy conditions without issue. The mower is smart enough to return to its dock during heavy downpours and resume once conditions improve.\n\nThe Lymow One represents what consumer technology should be – tools that handle tedious tasks so we can focus on what matters. While AI might be writing articles elsewhere, I’d much rather have it cutting my grass, giving me back those precious weekend hours for literally anything else. Heck, the enterprising Gujarati boy I am, I’d probably get it to mow my neighborhood’s lawn too and make some extra cash on the side. The point I’m making is that AI should work for you rather than the other way around – and with the Lymow One, it certainly does.\n\nClick Here to Buy Now: $1999 $2999 ($1000 off).

But as of now, when I’m writing this, you can get a pre-order in for the new 2-in-1 in the US. Probably.\n\nThe page is now open in Framework’s home territory, and indeed, the company was able to keep its promise of offering a lower-cost, modular, repairable laptop with a smaller touchscreen and convertible form factor. The lowest configuration of the Laptop 12 comes without RAM, storage, OS, or charger, all of which you’ll need to track down and install yourself, after ponying up $549 for the laptop frame and a 13th-gen Core i3 motherboard. Upgrades for the processor—and of course choose-your-own options for the other parts and Framework’s modular USB-C based ports (four of them, just like the Laptop 13)—are configurable, too.\n\nThat’s cheap for a Windows laptop with a touchscreen, if not exactly “budget” with all the trimmings added on. If you go with a pre-assembled model, you’ll be paying at least $800 for the Core i3 setup, with the base configuration including 8GB of memory, 512GB of storage, Windows 11, and four modular USB-C ports, all upgradeable. You can choose from one of five colorways, and I’m partial to the unique green-on-pink “bubblegum” option. The laptops are set to ship to buyers starting in July, and might be backed up with pre-orders for some time after that.\n\nFramework is a US company, but its primary manufacturing comes from Taiwan, which sits at a 10 percent import tax at the moment. That’s well below what it was earlier this week, and currently it’s set to remain there for the next three months. That said, Trump has been changing his mind on US foreign policy on an almost-daily basis. Who knows how long the status quo will remain, or if Framework will be able to maintain these relatively low prices after the initial deliveries are made?"}

We know this because Valve showed off a bunch of prototypes leading up to the final Steam Deck—and it looks like one of those prototypes somehow managed to slip the surly bonds of Bellevue and make its way to eBay.\n\nAccording to Reddit and Steam Deck HQ, a listing on the US eBay site sold the “Early Valve Engineering 34 Prototype” for $2,000 earlier this week. There’s no way to verify its authenticity, but the look and layout does match one of the latter prototypes Valve showed off in its Steam Deck “making of” booklet (PDF), particularly one with two distinctive blue face buttons. In the eBay photos, the rear of the device has a seal that reads, “Engineering Sample 34 – not for resale.”\n\nAssuming this is a legitimate Valve engineering prototype, I bet someone at the company—possibly in the legal department—would be very interested in whoever sold it and how they came about it. These kinds of devices are often vigorously guarded, sometimes even destroyed after the final retail product is ready, to protect any trade secrets or intellectual property that could be gleaned from them. Prototypes often fetch high prices on the secondary market, but usually a decade or more after the full release, long after they’ve become of interest only to chroniclers and tech YouTubers.\n\nIt sure looks like the prototype that Valve showed off. You can see relatively huge touchpads—circular like the original Steam Controller instead of the smaller square pads on the final Steam Deck—and what might be a broken right thumbstick. The left touchpad comes loose and might be damaged, and the whole thing has a rough quality with uneven plastic panels and tool marks. But for whatever it’s worth, I don’t see any obvious signs of an amateur 3D-printing project, which is what would be my first guess if someone was making a fake.\n\nThe listing sold from Kirkland, Washington state according to the eBay listing. So if this unit wandered off Valve’s primary headquarters in the Seattle area, it only got a couple of miles away before being sold. I hope whoever bought it somehow finds a way to give us a better look at the device… possibly before a team of attack lawyers buries them in cease-and-desist paperwork."}

I like major apps like AccuWeather and The Weather Channel, as well as smaller third-party ones like Hello Weather and Today Weather. Part of it’s due to living in Michigan and having so many different conditions to deal with throughout the year, and another part is because I’m just a nerd for trying new Android apps.\n\nGiven all this, you can imagine my excitement when Google launched its new Pixel Weather app alongside the Pixel 9 series last year. We’ve seen phone brands like Samsung, OnePlus, and others create weather apps specific to their devices, but they’re often never very good — and usually less of a full “app” and more just a basic weather UI that sends you to The Weather Channel’s website if you want to see any real data.\n\nPixel Weather, meanwhile, isn’t that at all. It’s a feature-rich, highly customizable, and incredibly well-designed weather app that’s quickly become one of my all-time favorites. There’s just one problem with it. I can only use Pixel Weather on Pixel phones, and it’s time that changes.\n\nDo you think Pixel Weather should be available for all Android phones? 1209 votes Yes 73 % No 27 %\n\nPixel Weather is everything a weather app should be\n\nJoe Maring / Android Authority\n\nWhat is it about Pixel Weather that makes it so good? For me, it’s a combination of a few things, starting with the sheer amount of available data. Basic information, such as an hourly forecast, a 10-day forecast, and upcoming precipitation, are here. But, like any good weather app, there’s a boatload of other info, too — including the sunrise/sunset times, humidity, visibility, air quality, UV index, and more.\n\nI especially like how in-depth Pixel Weather lets you dig into these things. The sunrise/sunset menu, for example, breaks down specific times for dawn, sunrise, sunset, and dusk — paired with a live illustration of the sun’s current position. Dig into the wind page, and there’s a helpful graph showing how fast wind speeds are for the coming hours, plus which direction they’re blowing in. As someone who likes looking at the nitty gritty data like this — particularly during spring storm season right now — it’s a treasure trove of info.\n\nAI Weather Report Sunrise/sunset Wind\n\nComparatively, for those times when I don’t want to parse through mountains of data, I quite like the AI Weather Report and Weather Insight features, both of which summarize key weather details at a glance. I think the AI branding is silly, but having a brief, written summary of the weather ahead is a nice, helpful touch.\n\nBeyond the data, Google just nailed the overall UI and design for Pixel Weather. Between the big and bold temperature at the top of the app, the whimsical shapes/colors for the various weather info, and the themed weather animations in the background, all of it gives the app a fun, lighthearted feel. Pixel Weather is also the only weather app I’ve used that vibrates my phone to mimic rain, snow, and thunderstorms, and it feels like magic whenever it happens. The included home screen widgets are excellent, too.\n\nJoe Maring / Android Authority\n\nFinally, just as you’d expect from an app designed with Android users in mind, Pixel Weather has fantastic customization. You can customize and reorder the position of almost all the tiles/widgets in the app. If the 10-day forecast is important to you, you can put that near the very top of the app. If you don’t particularly care about the weather map, you can move it to the bottom. This lets you arrange Pixel Weather to look and feel exactly how you want it, and as a customization nut, I love it.\n\nOf all the weather apps I've tried over the years, Pixel Weather stands out as one of my favorites.\n\nOf all the weather apps I’ve tried over the years, Pixel Weather stands out as one of my favorites. It’s loaded with data, pleasing to look at, fully customizable, and isn’t hampered by ads or extra fluff like news articles or videos. It checks all the boxes for what I want in a weather app.\n\nThe only problem, as mentioned above, is that it’s currently exclusive to the last few generations of Pixel phones. Unique software features are what make Pixel phones so compelling in the first place, but in the case of Pixel Weather, Google can (and should) turn it into the face of weather for all Android phones.\n\nThe default weather app Android deserves\n\nJoe Maring / Android Authority\n\nAs it currently stands, Android doesn’t have a de facto weather app for all devices. Samsung phones have Samsung Weather, while OnePlus phones have OnePlus Weather, but neither is particularly good. The closest thing we have is the weather UI that’s part of the Google app, and while it’s fine, it’s just a parred-down version of Pixel Weather — featuring similar design elements but less granular data and missing customization options.\n\nSimilar to how Google has its Phone, Messages, and Clock apps available on the Play Store for everyone, Google should really do the same with Pixel Weather. It doesn’t need to be installed on every Android phone by default, but it should be available in the Play Store as an option to download for anyone who wants it. Just like your texting or alarm app, checking the weather is one of the most basic functions of your phone. All Android users — not just Pixel owners — deserve a high-quality, go-to weather app.\n\nIf/when this happens, I’m all for Google keeping some features exclusive to Pixel phones. AI Summaries can stay limited to modern Pixels (and likely need to for technical reasons), plus more advanced features like the pollen count card and weather vibrations could remain only on Pixels, too. Google designed Pixel Weather with Pixel phones in mind, so it only makes sense that some of its more advanced features should stay with its own phones.\n\nJoe Maring / Android Authority\n\nBut beyond that, there’s no reason the core Pixel Weather app shouldn’t be available to all other Android phones. If you’re OK fiddling with APKs and sideloading, you can easily get Pixel Weather on non-Pixels already; Google just hasn’t taken that extra step of putting it on the Play Store for the masses.\n\nA proper, Google-made weather app is something Android’s been missing for ages, and now that Google has a good solution (and one that’s getting some much-needed missing features), it’s the perfect time to open up Pixel Weather to more people. With a slight name change to Google Weather — and adding the weather frog to it — everything is there for the default Android weather app we need."}

Although protocols occasionally provided more detailed information than did articles, most lacked clarity on specific PPI contributions, outcomes, and the effect on decision making within the randomised controlled trial. PPI reporting increased over time, but it never exceeded 30%. Articles in The BMJ reported PPI far more frequently than did those in the other major medical journals. However, PPI was often absent in the protocols, suggesting that some PPI activities/processes were not initially planned or documented.\n\nComparison with other studies\n\nThe dearth of PPI reporting has also been observed in other studies focused on specific medical specialties. For instance, Estrup and colleagues found similar levels of PPI reporting (18%) in intensive care trials (2019-22),20 whereas Owyang and colleagues reported only 0.4% in randomised controlled trials in orthopaedic surgery (2013-20).21 Even in journals with mandatory PPI reporting, reporting rates did not exceed 40%.2223 Although the lack of PPI reporting does not necessarily imply the absence of PPI, previous research suggests that limited PPI may result from inadequate planning and implementation, rather than from under-reporting.24 Our study provides new insights by investigating both articles and protocols across four major medical journals, revealing variability and inconsistency in PPI reporting between the two.\n\nWhen involved, patients, patient advocates, and patient representatives were the primary stakeholder groups engaged in PPI activities, followed by members of the public. Few articles and protocols explicitly named PPI contributors, limiting personalised recognition and undervaluing their contributions. However, privacy concerns or trial regulations may prevent specific naming of contributors. To avoid misinterpretation, publications should clarify when the lack of recognition is not an oversight but is due to consent or compliance. Conversely, PPI that may include potential conflicts of interest or advocacy, or might influence other activities—for example, patients also involved in regulatory processes—should be transparently disclosed, ideally by name.\n\nPPI mainly occurred in the development phase of randomised controlled trials, particularly in trial committees (69%), a remarkably higher rate than reported by Husson and colleagues (40%) and Price and colleagues (38%).2224 Although other studies also emphasised PPI at the beginning of randomised controlled trials (for example, setting research agendas), these pre-trial PPI activities were less prominent in our study.2025 Notably, PPI was minimal in the post-trial reporting phase, such as writing and reviewing study results, despite literature indicating its crucial role in making research findings more meaningful and accessible to patients.262728\n\nThe number of PPI activities/processes reported per randomised controlled trial has varied greatly. Some studies comprehensively covered multiple PPI areas, but many focused on just one or two areas. Moreover, PPI descriptions often lacked depth, likely owing to the limited space imposed by journals in articles and the lack of standardised guidance on PPI reporting.21 Although protocols are not restricted and allow for more extensive and detailed reporting, most still provided little or no mention of PPI. A potential gap exists between planned and actual PPI activities, and PPI is often under-reported in articles, undermining its value. This inconsistency in reporting may hinder the systematic assessment and comparison of PPI practices across clinical research.\n\nRecognition of PPI in authorship was rare, and even acknowledgments, mainly recognising PPI, were sparse and often anonymous, consistent with previous studies.2224 Some contributors may have had dual roles, such as being both researchers and care givers, but these perspectives were not always clearly reported.29 Including PPI members as authors, in compliance with recommendations from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, and detailing their roles would better reflect their significant involvement and demonstrate deeper levels of engagement."}

And, with the roll-out of the new Meta Verified subscription, getting that little icon is not only reserved for public figures (as long as you're happy to pay a monthly fee, of course).\n\nIn this post, we'll cover what verification is, the two ways to get a blue check on the social media platform (with and without paying for Meta Verified), plus some FAQs about the blue tick.\n\nWhat does it mean to be verified on Instagram?\n\nYou've almost certainly seen the blue check next to an account's name on Instagram — that means that the account in question has been verified.\n\nBefore the introduction of Meta Verified, that verified badge meant that Instagram had confirmed that the account was both authentic, and represents a notable brand or influencer, public figure, or celebrity.\n\nBut now Meta Verified offers another route to the verified badge, and Meta, the company that owns Instagram and Facebook, is keen to differentiate between the two.\n\nThe difference between Meta Verified and verified badges\n\nWhile both of these are routes to getting the coveted blue check next to your Instagram handle, Meta seems to be keen to draw a line between the two. Here's how they explain it in Instagram's Help Center\n\n“Verified badges are different from Meta Verified.\n\nVerified badges confirm that a notable account is the authentic presence for that person or brand.\n\nMeta Verified is a paid subscription that confirms that the account is validated and authentic. This subscription comes with a bundle of features and benefits available for both eligible profiles and eligible businesses.”\n\nReading between the lines of this help article, it looks a lot like Instagram might consider changes to the notable person verified badges in the future:\n\n“As we test and learn, there will be no immediate changes to accounts on Instagram or Facebook that are already verified based on prior requirements.”\n\nWhat are the benefits of getting verified on Instagram?\n\nA verified badge is effectively a signpost for Instagram users that certain accounts are authentic — no bots, fake accounts, meme accounts, or even fan accounts are eligible. “If an account has the verified badge, we've confirmed that it represents who it says it does.”\n\nThere are a number of benefits to Instagram verification. If you are a brand or business, getting verified could be a powerful tool in your social media marketing strategy:\n\nIt adds credibility — this can be key if you're sharing important research, news, or articles.\n\n— this can be key if you're sharing important research, news, or articles.

As previously mentioned, there are rumors of higher reach and engagement with Meta Verified, but I tested Meta Verified and found that it had little effect on my content performance.\n\nAs previously mentioned, there are now two ways to get a blue tick on your Instagram account. The first we'll unpack here is the simplest, and you don't need to be a notable figure to do it — but the social media platform will charge you a monthly fee.\n\nHow to get verified on Instagram with Meta Verified\n\nAs I touched on above, there are two ways to get your verified badge on Instagram. The easiest is through Meta Verified — here's how to go that route.\n\nStep 1. Make sure you meet the Meta Verified eligibility requirements\n\nTo subscribe to Meta Verified, you'll need:\n\nTo be at least 18 years old.\n\nA public or private profile that's associated with your full name and has a profile photo that includes your face.\n\nTo meet minimum activity requirements, such as prior posting history.\n\nA valid photo ID that matches your profile name and profile picture.\n\nTwo-factor authentication enabled on your profile.\n\nTo follow our Terms of Use and Community Guidelines.\n\nStep 2. Sign up for Meta Verified via Instagram\n\nHead over to your Instagram profile by tapping your profile picture on the bottom right of the app. Tap the hamburger menu (the three lines on the top right). Choose ‘Meta Verified.' Read through the explainer, then tap ‘Next'. Choose which Meta accounts you'd like verified. Confirm and pay. From here on out, you'll be charged the Meta Verified monthly subscription fee unless you cancel. It could take up to 48 hours for your blue tick (and all the benefits) to appear.\n\nHow to get verified on Instagram as a notable figure\n\nThis route to getting Instagram verification may be free, but there are a few more hoops to jump through. In a nutshell, you'll need to request your verified badge from Instagram. Here's a step-by-step guide to the verification process for notable figures.\n\nStep 1. Follow standard best practices on Instagram (easy)\n\nTo be eligible for your verified badge, you need to do a few pretty standard things:\n\nYou have to follow Instagram's Terms of Use and Community Guidelines. (That involves things like not spreading false or misleading information, hateful conduct, and violence, which Meta takes really seriously)\n\nYou have to represent a real person\n\nYou need to represent the unique presence of that person or business (only one account per person/business can be verified)\n\n(only one account per person/business can be verified) And you have to have a complete profile: that means a profile picture, a bio, and a public, active account\n\nStep 2. Prove that you are a notable account (more difficult)\n\nTo get your verified badge on Instagram for free, you'll need to prove that you are notable — which will be easier for some than others. Being notable means you represent “represent a well-known, highly searched-for person,” according to Instagram.\n\nWhat does that mean, exactly? Instagram shared a helpful tip: When looking at whether or not to give an account a verified badge, they look for accounts that have been featured in multiple news sources. Paid and promotional content do not count.\n\nThey also shared that they recently made some tweaks to the verification process, expanding their list of news sources to \"include more diverse outlets, including those from additional Black, LGBTQ+, Latinx media, and including more outlets from around the world for example.” Which is great news!\n\nIf you haven't yet been featured in multiple outlets, head down to the next section on tips for getting your verified badge, and we will walk you through some advice. If you do have this proof, you can move on to submitting your application.\n\nStep 3. Submit an application to Instagram (easy)\n\nThe actual application for getting your verified badge isn't too bad; you do it right from within your own Instagram account.\n\nHere's how to request to be verified on Instagram:\n\nFrom your Instagram account, tap on the hamburger menu in the top right corner.\n\nTap Creator/Business tools and controls in the ‘For professionals' section. (The button name will depend on whether you have an Instagram Creator account or Business account.\n\nTap Request verification at the bottom of the page.\n\nat the bottom of the page. Fill out the form (you'll be asked for an identification document like a driver's license or passport, your creator category, and links to various articles and other sites you are featured in). When you've filled it all out, hit Submit.\n\nThat's it!\n\nYou will be notified on the Instagram app within 30 days if your application for a verified badge is successful. If you don't get verified, you can apply again in 30 days.\n\nNote that if you apply more than once before they review your original application, they will cancel the application entirely — so it's worth it to be patient here instead of spoiling your chances of getting that blue check.\n\n3 tips for getting verified as a notable figure\n\nNow, of course, if getting your notable person verified badge was easy, almost everyone would do it. But it's not — so here are some things you can do to increase your chances of Instagram verification.\n\n1: Grow your following on Instagram\n\nInstagram verifies accounts that are active on the platform, so stay active while working to grow your account. Part of beingnotable in Instagram's eyes is how many people are following you on the network, so it's never a bad thing to keep increasing that number.\n\nWe can help with that:\n\n2: Get media mentions\n\nEasier said than done, but entirely possible. You want to start with at least three links for your application, and that's an achievable goal. You can start reaching out to publications that you believe would be interested in your story or what you're working on and pitch them your business.\n\nIf you have the budget, you can also hire a publicist or PR agency to help as part of your marketing strategy.\n\n3: Be strategic about when you apply\n\nIf you don't have a really strong case for being verified, be strategic about when you send off that request.\n\nIs a Reel of yours going viral right now? That's a great time to apply. Did you just get a ton of press mentions in a week? Go ahead and apply! Timing can be everything, so make sure you are careful and thoughtful about your application.\n\nInstagram verification FAQ\n\nHow many followers do you need on Instagram to get verified as a public figure?\n\nThere isn't a requirement to have a certain number of followers to get a blue check, however, you have to prove that you are notable as part of the verification process, and part of that notability is having people interested in following you.\n\nInstagram will likely take follower count into consideration when they are reviewing your application, which is why we recommend growing your Instagram following before you apply.\n\nHow long does it take to get verified on Instagram?\n\nRequesting verification as a public figure takes about 30 days, however, you can be approved and verified much sooner than that. It depends on the team that is reviewing those applications, so it varies a lot.\n\nGetting Meta Verified happens much faster. Once you've made your first monthly payment, you can expect to see your blue check — and all the other benefits — on your Instagram profile within 48 hours.\n\nDo you have to pay to get verified on Instagram?\n\nIf you're not a public figure who can apply for free verification via the steps we've outlined above, then yes — a Meta Verified subscription is the simplest way to get your verification badge.\n\nBe warned, though: There are plenty of scams and websites that promise to get you verified for a fee. Steer clear of these — the only way to get verified is via Instagram or Facebook.\n\nHow much does a Meta Verified subscription cost?\n\nGetting verified on Instagram via Meta Verified will cost $14.99 per month (slightly more if you opt for bundling your Facebook page or profile into your subscription). Note that the cost of the paid subscription may vary depending on your region.\n\nIf you're after your public figure verification badge on Instagram, the best approach is to work your way up gradually. Over time, you can grow your following and prove your notability, which will significantly help the success rate of your application.\n\nIf you're off to apply for that verification right now — good luck to you! 🍀"}

Over the course of a year, the butterflies will fly about twice that — more than 9,000 miles in all.\n\nThe Painted Ladies are one of the most widely distributed butterflies in the world, appearing on every continent except Antarctica and sometimes crossing the seas and oceans between them. Just last year, researchers discovered that a flock of Painted Ladies rode the wind over the Atlantic Ocean from West Africa to the northern coast of South America — the first documented insect journey across an ocean.\n\nThe Painted Lady’s migration, chronicled in the photographer Lucas Foglia’s new book, “Constant Bloom,” is a powerful reminder of our interconnections with nature and our shared stake in an ever-changing world.\n\nThe butterflies’ resilience shows us that some species are capable of adapting to dramatic changes in climate, food availability and urban development. But they also require humans’ attention to continue thriving. If we don’t protect their breeding grounds and nectar sources, these butterflies could meet the same fate as many others. While there is no data showing a change in the population of Painted Ladies, a recent study revealed that American butterfly populations decreased 22 percent between 2000 and 2020, in part because of habitat loss, climate change and farmers’ use of insecticides.\n\nPainted Ladies’ most skillful form of adaptation is their solution to their need for flowers for nectar and a place to lay their eggs. As humans transform the landscapes along their migration route, the insects are forced to lay eggs on plants near roads and upturned soil from building developments. When they encounter droughts, the butterflies benefit from not being picky — they can feast on a wide range of blooming plants, which these days are often in cultivated spaces such as parks, farms and gardens. Along the way, they’re often helping humans by pollinating fruit trees, such as apples, cherries and citrus, moving pollen from one blossom to another.\n\nAs they cross the Mediterranean, which extends about 500 miles north-south, favorable winds can help the butterflies fly faster or higher. One entire migratory cycle from central Africa to the Arctic Circle and back again requires up to 10 generations — the butterflies that leave Africa are not the same ones that return the next spring. Think of it as a butterfly relay race.\n\nIn the spring they mate in the Mediterranean region and that generation migrates to northern Europe in early summer.\n\nWhen they head south again and arrive at the tropical African savanna — verdant, lush and full of flowers — their orange and black wings are a bit paler, more shredded at the outer edges. But they regain their strength after sipping on nectar. Painted lady butterflies lay up to 500 eggs at a time, so by the next spring, their great-great-great-grand-insects will join the journey north, back into Scandinavia.\n\nUntil recently, scientists didn’t know exactly where the Painted Ladies spent the winter in Africa. In 2023, Gerard Talavera, a scientist at the Institut Botànic de Barcelona, and his collaborators from six countries, published a paper detailing their detective work across the butterflies’ breeding region, from Senegal on Africa’s west coast to Kenya in the east. They found that from September to November, the butterflies were making their home in the semiarid savannas before moving south to more humid savannas and highlands from December to February. Understanding how these ranges may shift with climate change is critical to butterfly conservation efforts.\n\nDr. Talavera’s work, which is ongoing, is a reminder that when scientists work together across borders to study biodiversity and protect critical habitats, the world stands a better chance of preserving the delicate ecological balance that these butterflies — and the planet — rely on.\n\nThe Painted Ladies’ lesson is this: Even if our wings become frayed and raggedy after a long and difficult journey, it’s not too late to find new ways to persist. It’s not too late to come together to address the most urgent issues of our time.\n\nGraphic by Taylor Maggiacomo.\n\nAimee Nezhukumatathil is a poet and an essayist and the author of “Bite by Bite: Nourishments and Jamborees,” and “World of Wonders: In Praise of Fireflies, Whale Sharks, and Other Astonishments.”\n\nLucas Foglia was a Guggenheim fellow in photography.

(Next Chapter, Spudos & Social Enterprise) for very nearly fifteen years. Initially, and admittedly, the articles practically wrote themselves, which was ideal for a self-taught designer with very little experience but keen to take an approach to learning that was very much my own. That was to write about a piece of packaging or a new brand identity every weekday in a very public manner (for a bit of accountability) as a way to try to make sense of it.\n\nWhat I meant by ‘write themselves’ was that there was an ingenuity and simplicity to the brands that this studio was designing. They were often characterised by a few but carefully crafted set of components composed in a harmonious and consistent manner. For someone without a graphic design background, I learnt the fundaments from work like this. And further, that success wasn’t just the the design of distinctive and functional assets, but also the ability to draw a client into believing in (and signing off on) a simple expression and the technical skill to apply them in the real world (this was before there were sophisticated mock-ups). What I also enjoyed was that, despite the creative wit and simplicity, I could guarantee that Paul Belford wasn’t doing it just for fun (or what would now be considered an audience or following). This is of course fine, but not what BP&O is about. An important delineation we continue to hold to.\n\nOf course, as I gained more insights, and practical skills working with clients, writing about projects with more scope and operating cross-platform (this started to include a lot more motion, instances of generative identities, and custom typefaces) the blog evolved into something more substantial. Regardless of this evolution, BP&O has always loved and celebrated a good logo, and why we return to Paul Belford Ltd with a look at the studio’s work for Ten (new website coming soon!), a chain of health and fitness studios in London.\n\n“The symbol is formed by a line balancing on a circle to make an abstracted letter ‘T’. It is designed to work with their strapline: ‘Your centre of balance. A line and a circle are also the constituent graphic elements of a ten numeral.”\n\nSometimes a logo has a story. Sometimes it is ‘read’, an idea inferred, a feeling conferred, or an abstract form that simply identifies. This is one of those, a-ha, yes, its a ten, and its all about balance. Perfect. Distinctive, simple, ownable (because of the two readings, context matters here). And, in its solid geometric form can be easily applied, scaled up and down, across all the places it needs to exist, from signage, to tote bag to ads, and whatever new merch that a health and fitness studio will find itself producing.\n\nPaul Belford himself has spent part of his career in the advertising industry, and continues to lend this skill to print ads and copywriting. The cold geometry of the logo is juxtaposed by the warmth and inviting tone of these other aspects, further softened by pastel colours, single colour tinted photography and Funkis, a geometric typeface which itself contains some interesting ‘poses’. Belford knows asymmetrical balance well, and the compositions of these ads (single typeface, one size, with tints creating hierarchy and flow) lend themselves well to the overall theme.\n\nIt’s tempting to draw articles like these out (500 words is like the 9mins of a Youtube vid, enough to stick some ads into–please subscribe to LogoArchive!), to describe literally what is happening. To call type ‘professional’ and colour ‘reassuring’. Brand is a wonderful world of both complexity and simplicity. We should honour the latter, by keeping things short and to the point where necessary. I love this."}

The cleverest techniques are hidden until you flip the build around.\n\nLink treads are used to hold the wooden slats in place at a subtle angle.

LEGO kicked off the trend of finding unusual black elements to use as wrought iron in the earliest modulars, turning screwdrivers, harpoons, and skeleton feet into railings.

// ..この後クソ長いCDKスタックを記述がある\n\nこれって普通に変数: backend を引数にした createApi(backend) 関数を api/resource.ts に定義して使えば api の定義をまとまられます。\n\n普通はそうしますが出来ない理由がこれです。\n\nconst backend : Backend < { auth : ConstructFactory < BackendAuth > ; data : ConstructFactory < AmplifyGraphqlApi > ; myApiFunction : ConstructFactory < ResourceProvider < ... > & ResourceAccessAcceptorFactory & AddEnvironmentFactory & StackProvider > ; } >\n\nこれが変数: backend にカーソルを合わせると出てくるヒントですが、そもそもキーが動的で、 type Backend<T> は @aws-amplify/backend から取り出せますが、その型引数はどこからどう引っ張れば取り出せるのか謎。\n\nこう言う場合、createApi() 関数はこう書くしかありません。（CDKの内容なんて Backend<any> ではとても対応できません）\n\namplify/api/resource.ts import { backend } from ' ../backend ' export function createApi () { //... }\n\nはい、普通は引数で入れるものを export / import で直接持っていきました。\n\nもうTS終わってませんか？ 頭大丈夫ですか？\n\nそもそも論、AWSチームの AWS SDK も Amplify もどうして常に完全リニューアルしてしまうのでしょうか？\n\nAmplify Gen2 に至っては、完全に作りかけのモック段階なのにどうしてAWSコンソールをGen2という全く別物の仕様に作り変えてしまうのでしょう？\n\n信頼できるベンターとして論外ですし、普通にAWSを辞めるレベルの粗悪さです。\n\n、、、話を戻しましょう。\n\nTypeScriptの最大の魅力は、補完、ジャンプ、インテリセンスといったIDE体験の向上ですね。\n\nしかしその代償として、\n\n複雑な型設計\n\nビルドパイプラインの増加\n\n型定義の保守コスト\n\nが発生しており、チーム全体の生産性や開発速度を確実に損なっていると思います。\n\nテメーが気持ちよくなるために開発コストを何倍も注げる訳がありません。\n\nそう言う場合は家で一人でデュフっていて下さい。\n\nTypeScriptでは、型を再利用・合成するために、さらに抽象化されたユーティリティ型が必要になる。\n\nこれにより、\n\nコードの視認性低下\n\n実装とは直接関係のないコードが大量に生まれ\n\n読みづらく、壊れやすく、テスト不能な構造\n\nがプロジェクト内に蔓延する。\n\n「型を守るために実装が犠牲になる」ような状態は、本末転倒以外の何物でもない。\n\nAmplifyの例もこれに当てはまりますし、AWS SDKも現在は（不要な）改善により少なくなっていますが、実装ファイル内に型の 定義/import/export が大量に書かれ、本質的な実装が1/10程度しか無いようなコードがありました。\n\nとても見られるようなファイルではなく、私がTSを否定するようになったのはこのコードを見て確信を得たからです。\n\nTypeScriptの導入理由としてよく挙げられるのが、「大規模開発に耐えられる」というものです。\n\nまるでJavaでも使っているような言い方ですね。お笑いです。\n\n確かに、型による静的検査は一定の安心材料になるります。\n\nしかし、実際に大規模開発において求められるのは、\n\n明確な仕様と要件の定義\n\n密結合の排除（ドメイン駆動設計（DDD）やモジュール設計の力）\n\nテスト戦略の充実\n\n組織的なコードレビュー体制と運用ルール\n\nといった、言語に依存しない設計と運用の実力の部分であり、全然素のnode.jsでも問題ありません。\n\nTypeScriptは型の整合性を強く求めるがゆえに、ある段階を超えると変更コストが異常に高くなる傾向があります。\n\n3で言った、TSの言語仕様と型の不整合さも相まって、\n\n型の再設計が必要になる\n\n影響範囲が不明確になり、ビルドすら通らなくなる\n\n型定義が他のモジュールに波及し、修正が伝播する\n\nその結果、\n\n「型があるから安心してスケールできる」はずが、いつの間にか「型のせいで一切変更が効かない」状態に陥ることがあるはずです。\n\nここまで来ると、チームは「一部を書き直すより、リプレイスした方が早い」という選択を迫られます。\n\n実際に、TypeScriptによって柔軟性を失ったコードベースが、長期的な保守困難性を生み、プロダクトの寿命を縮める例もあるようです。\n\n極端な笑い話と思うかもしれませんが、TSを採用することによってこうなる可能性がある限り、ESMを選択する判断は合理的であると思います。\n\n💡 スケーラビリティの鍵は型ではなく設計\n\nつまり、TSはスケーラビリティの「保証」ではなく「条件の一部」に過ぎません。\n\nむしろ導入と運用を誤れば、型という名の足かせになり得ることを知ってもらいたいです。\n\n「スケールする開発」と「TypeScriptを使うこと」はイコールではない。\n\n真のスケーラビリティは、設計力と運用体制に宿る。\n\n7. tscの通過が安心材料になってしまう危険性\n\n「tscが通っているから大丈夫」という認識は、開発チーム全体の思考停止を招く最悪の兆候であると思います。\n\n実際には、\n\nテストがない\n\n実行時の型保証がない\n\nバリデーションが不十分\n\nといった問題を覆い隠し、型だけで品質が担保されたかのような幻想を生みます。\n\n特に「型でバリデーションは出来ない」と言うことは覚えておいてほしいものです。\n\n👿 tsconfigの黒魔術\n\n余談ですが、tsconfigの「なぜか分からんけどこれを追加すると問題が解決する」というような黒魔術にStackOverflowで何度か出会いました。地盤をコントロール出来ていないと言うのはかなり危ういよう思います。\n\nついでに、Deno ではTypeScriptがネイティブサポートされていますが、tsconfigは無く「Denoのビルドシステムに合わせて書いとけ」という設計。筆者にはこれが TS軽視 に思えました。\n\n8. 柔軟性を捨ててまで得られるものが少ない\n\nTypeScriptを導入することで、JavaScript本来の持つ柔軟性——すぐに書けて、すぐに試せて、すぐに変えられるという特性——は大きく損なわれます。\n\n結果として、\n\n書けるはずのコードが「型的にNG」で書けない\n\n小さな修正にも型定義の修正が必要\n\nといった事態が発生し、設計と変更に対するストレスが不自然に高くなります。\n\n9. 現場レベルでは高コスト構造になりやすい\n\nTSは「正しく使えば」強力なツールであることは否定しません。\n\nしかしそれには、\n\n適切な型設計の知識\n\n組織全体での合意形成\n\n一貫した設計ルール\n\nといった極めて高度な運用が前提となります。（それこそJavaスタイルで書くような...）\n\n中途半端な理解と運用では、むしろ開発速度と品質の両方が損なわれる可能性あることを覚えておいて下さい。\n\nTSを採用して得られるものとは一体何なのでしょうか？\n\n10. ESM + JSDoc + tsc はTypeScriptの理想を抽出した形である\n\n筆者が採用している ESM + JSDoc + tsc という構成は、\n\nJSの柔軟性と実行速度を損なわず\n\n補完・型チェックの恩恵だけを享受でき\n\n型定義の配布（.d.ts）も可能\n\nという点で、静的型付けの「良い部分」だけを抽出した理想的なアプローチなように思います。\n\nTSの導入で苦しんでいるチームがあれば、この構成は非常に有効な代替手段となるはずです。\n\nJSDoc は TypeScript と比較すると簡易的な型システムです。\n\nしかし、大抵の型は表現出来ますし、何よりAltJSでなく.jsファイル内のコメントで型を表現する手法が素晴らしいと考えています。\n\nTypeScriptは、静的型付けによる補完や型チェックの恩恵を提供する一方で、運用や設計において多くの課題を抱えています。特に、以下の点を考慮せずに導入することは、プロジェクト全体の柔軟性や生産性を損なうリスクを伴います。\n\n型の信頼性の限界\n\nTypeScriptの型システムは万能ではなく、 any や @ts-ignore といった抜け道が存在するため、型があることが必ずしも安全性を保証するわけではありません。 運用コストの増加\n\n型設計や保守にかかるコストが、プロジェクトの規模やチームのスキルセットに見合わない場合、かえって開発効率を低下させる可能性があります。 柔軟性の喪失\n\nJavaScript本来の持つ柔軟性が制約され、小さな変更にも型定義の修正が必要になるなど、開発のスピード感が失われることがあります。 設計力の重要性\n\n真にスケールする開発を実現するためには、言語に依存しない設計力や運用体制が不可欠であり、TypeScriptの導入がそれを補完するものではないことを認識する必要があります。 TypeScriptに開発コストを割けるか\n\nTypeScriptはSaaSなどWebの現場が多いと思いますが、開発スピード、プロダクトの増加、人員の確保など総合的に考えて本当に合理的な選択かを考える必要があります。\n\n最後に\n\n私のチームでは絶対に採用しませんが、TypeScriptを採用するかどうかは、プロジェクトの特性やチームの状況に応じて慎重に判断しましょう。\n\n脳死でJavaScriptを軽視し、TypeScriptは正義であるとは思わず、「TypeScriptには一定のリスクが伴う」ことを理解して頂きたいです。\n\n今回の問題提起で、今一度 TypeScript について見直して頂けますと幸いです。"}

He is most known for defending panpsychism, the view that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the physical world. Fifteen years ago, panpsychism was laughed at, if it was thought of at all. Goff has led a movement that has made panpsychism a mainstream position, taught to undergraduates and widely discussed in academic journals.\n\n\n\nGoff is the author of Galileo’s Error: Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness and Why? The Purpose of the Universe. He has published 50 academic articles and has written extensively for newspapers and magazines, including Scientific American, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, Aeon and the Times Literary Supplement.\n\nPlease enjoy!\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Castbox, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Audible, or on your favorite podcast platform.

That’s up to a one-year supply of Vitamin D as added value when you try their delicious and comprehensive daily, foundational nutrition supplement that supports whole-body health.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Our Place’s Titanium Always Pan® Pro! Many nonstick pans can release harmful “forever chemicals”—PFAS—into your food, your home, and, ultimately, your body. Teflon is a prime example—it is *the* forever chemical that most companies are still using. Exposure to PFAS has been linked to major health issues like gut microbiome disruption, testosterone dysregulation, and more, which have been correlated to chronic disease in the long term. This is why I use the Titanium Always Pan Pro from today’s sponsor, Our Place. It’s the first nonstick pan with zero coating. This means zero “forever chemicals” and a durability that will last a lifetime. That’s right—no degradation over time like traditional nonstick pans.\n\nNow, Our Place has expanded their lineup and launched the Titanium Pro Cookware Set—a completely toxin-free, high-performance set designed to last a lifetime.

And so in a sense, physics doesn’t care what matter is, it doesn’t care what physical reality is, it just cares what its mathematical structure is.”\n\n— Philip Goff\n\n“We don’t know if we can get consciousness out of physics, but we know we can get physics out of consciousness.”\n\n— Philip Goff\n\n[On the integrated information theory:] “The proposal is that at the exact moment when a system has more integrated information in the whole than in the parts, that’s when the lights come on. That’s when you get consciousness.”\n\n— Philip Goff\n\nRelated\n\nThe Tim Ferriss Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than one billion downloads.

Previous Tablo models once topped our list of the best over-the-air DVRs for cord-cutters, but the fourth-generation version has been too buggy and unreliable to recommend.\n\nMy attempt to give Tablo another shot quickly went off the rails, though, as the aforementioned Roku update introduced a connection error that made the app unusable. While the bug doesn’t affect everyone, it’s indicative of the recurring issues Tablo users have experienced with the latest hardware and corresponding software. I’m still hoping Tablo’s close to turning the corner and living up to its promises, but it’s not quite there yet.\n\nWhat is Tablo again?\n\nA fourth-generation Tablo DVR connected to a flat-panel antenna. The E.W. Scripps Company\n\nA quick refresher: Tablo is an over-the-air DVR that lets you record local channels from an antenna. But Instead of plugging directly into your TV, the Tablo DVR streams video to other devices on your home network. Set it up wherever you get the best antenna reception, and you can watch through the Tablo app on Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV, Google TV/Android TV, LG TVs, and Samsung TVs. (There’s also a mobile app for iOS and Android.)\n\nFor newcomers, the concept can be tricky to understand, but the advantage is that a single antenna and DVR can feed multiple televisions throughout the home, with no extra equipment beyond what you use for streaming. The same recordings are available across all TVs, and you can watch without switching inputs away from your streaming device.\n\nIn 2022, The E.W. Scripps Company, a major broadcaster, acquired Nuvyyo, the company behind Tablo, and it oversaw a complete rewrite of Tablo’s software, which debuted on its fourth-gen DVR in 2023. While the up-front price is similar to previous models—$130 for a dual-tuner model, $160 for the quad-tuner version—it no longer carries subscription fees, and it adds a lineup of free streaming channels that you can record as well.\n\nThe new Tablo can record both over-the-air stations and a selection of free streaming channels. Jared Newman / Foundry\n\nOn paper, it’s a slam dunk. Most other over-the-air DVR solutions cost a lot more, and some require complicated DIY equipment setups. Tablo is simpler and has an unbeatable price.\n\nSo it’s all the more disappointing that things don’t work as they should. In my review, I ran into a long list of bugs and glitches, and the device had a tendency to go offline without warning. Last year, I ran into the same issues after setting up the device again, and it’s been sitting in my gadget drawer ever since.\n\nTablo’s new Roku app issues\n\nJared Newman / Foundry\n\nEverything seemed to be going smoothly when I installed the Tablo again earlier this week. Device setup happens through Tablo’s mobile app, and within minutes it was pulling in live TV from my antenna.\n\nBut when I opened Tablo’s Roku app, it never got past the “Connecting to your Tablo…” loading screen. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, rebooting the Roku, switching to a different Roku player, and rebooting the Tablo itself. The app refused to load every time.\n\nLaura Slater, a Tablo spokeswoman, says Tablo is aware of the problem, which has also been reported by other users on its forums. Tablo expects to have a fix out next week, but affected Roku users are out of luck until then. That’s a week of total downtime for a bad software update.\n\nThe update is a substantial one, with features that bring the Roku app into parity with other platforms. There’s now a mini guide for flipping through channels from the playback screen, for instance, and a new left sidebar for navigation.\n\nBut if you can’t get the app working, there’s no way to roll back. The only workarounds are to switch to a different streaming device (Tablo’s Fire TV app worked fine for me), or to use AirPlay or screen mirroring to send video from a phone. (I tried the former, but it wasn’t a great experience, with the video out of sync with the audio).\n\nThis isn’t the first time Tablo issues have prevented users from accessing their antenna streams. Last September, a prolonged server outage disabled live TV playback, even though over-the-air TV shouldn’t require internet at all. Tablo says it’s working on offline support, but in the meantime it had more server outages in January. In November, Roku’s OS 14 update removed support for AC3 Surround Sound passthrough, in turn preventing live TV playback on Roku devices. Tablo had to scramble to release a fix that let users disable surround sound entirely.\n\nImprovements are coming\n\nCurrent Roku issues aside, Slater says Tablo has done a lot of recent work to improve connectivity in Tablo’s firmware, apps, and back-end server connections. I’ll be checking to see if those claims hold up in the coming weeks.\n\nBut the bigger updates may come over the summer. That’s when Tablo plans to launch offline playback support and offer its new firmware as an optional upgrade for older DVR models. (Tablo originally planned to make that upgrade available in the fall of 2023.)\n\nPerhaps all this means that Tablo will finally be ready for prime time in the months ahead. For the sake of all over-the-air DVR enthusiasts, I hope it’s not another false start.\n\nSign up for Jared’s Cord Cutter Weekly newsletter for more advice on navigating the post-cable era."}

Samsung has finally, finally, finally begun rolling out stable One UI 7 to devices outside of the Galaxy S25 series in the US, three days after it began the rollout in South Korea and a good seven months after Google released the Android 15 platform update for the Pixels.\n\nOne UI 7 stable rollout has begun in the US with the Galaxy S24 series, with beta users reportedly receiving the stable update on their unlocked devices. Carrier variants should also be part of this rollout, but we haven’t seen reports yet.\n\nThe update appears to be rolling out to beta users first. Since this is a significant platform update, we recommend using an unmetered internet connection to download and install it because of its large size. If you have been part of the One UI 7 beta program, the update will naturally be smaller in size for you, as the user reports that the experience is pretty much the same on One UI 7 stable as it was on beta.\n\nTo check if your phone has received the One UI 7 update, head to Settings > Software Update > Check for updates. Despite the excruciatingly long and silent delay, Samsung will continue to roll out the update in a gradual, phased manner to avoid flooding the user base with any unexpected critical bugs, so not everyone will receive the update on the same day. Samsung users have been patient until now, so hold tight for a bit more if the update isn’t showing up on your Galaxy S24 yet.\n\nDevices expected to get One UI 7 in the first wave include the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6. After this, we expect the update to reach the Galaxy S23 series, Galaxy S23 FE, Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5, and the Galaxy Tab S10 series in the coming weeks. From there, you can expect the update to spread beyond to the rest of Samsung’s expansive portfolio of devices.\n\nOne UI 7 brings features like Look Now and Now Bar, a vertical app drawer, several camera features, and more. You can check out our One UI 7 review for all the highlights.\n\nOne UI 7 full changelog Here’s the full, official changelog for the One UI 7 update:\n\nGalaxy AI Professional Writing Assistance: Experience Galaxy AI’s writing assistant by selecting text to open a popup.

Enough so to dominate the ultra-premium tablet market to the extent that the Tab S series is the only Android competitor to the iPad Pro.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 series has shaken things up in unexpected ways. There are only two models, the $999 Tab S10 Plus and the $1,199 Tab S10 Ultra, as the smaller 11-inch model has been dropped from the lineup. So, the Tab S10 series starts at $1,000, just like the iPad Pro Samsung wants to compete with. When you’re spending laptop money on an ultra-premium tablet, it should be able to back that up with a flawless experience. No matter how much I love the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, flawless isn’t a word I can use to describe it.\n\nIt’s all about the screen\n\nZac Kew-Denniss / Android Authority\n\nTo no one’s surprise, the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus display is beautiful, even if it’s mostly identical to its predecessor. This 12.4-inch AMOLED display is razor sharp at 1,752 x 2,800 pixels and a joy to use thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. The screen’s brightness is okay at 650 nits but falls behind the behemoth Ultra, which reaches a more impressive 930 nits.\n\nThankfully, the Galaxy Tab S10 series inherits one of my favorite features from the Galaxy S25 Ultra — an anti-reflective coating that makes the tablet much easier to use outdoors, even without a boosted max brightness. It’s hard to overstate the difference something like this makes, but you can use this tablet in well-lit environments instead of leaving it in your bag. The downside to anti-reflective screens is that you lose that benefit when applying a screen protector, but thankfully, Samsung sells one of its own that does its best to preserve it, and it’s available for all of the Tab S Plus models going back to the S8. In fact, a screen protector is essential for this tablet. Samsung won’t say what glass this device uses other than confirming it’s Gorilla Glass. I think it’s being vague for a reason, because my unit developed a scratch less than two hours into my using it, long before I put it in a backpack or bag.\n\nA Samsung device should have the best display in its segment. That's the bar Samsung set for itself, but it's failed to clear that bar with the Tab S10 Plus.\n\nThere’s a lot to love about this screen, but it pains me to say it isn’t the best anymore. It used to be a given that a flagship Samsung product would have the best display on the market, but Apple has claimed that crown with the 2024 iPad Pro lineup, which features a breathtaking Tandem OLED that can reach 1,000 nits of sustained brightness and 1,600 nits in HDR. The Tab S10 Ultra has a unique selling pint because of its sheer size, but the Plus model sadly is much of a 1:1 comparison with Cupertino’s best, and unless Samsung’s more landscape aspect ratio appeals to you, it comes second best.\n\nInside the display is a somewhat disappointing fingerprint scanner. It’s not bad; the optical scanner is reliable and quick enough, but it doesn’t come close to the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner that has existed in Samsung’s S series phones (aside from the FE models) since the S10 and S10 Plus. Ultrasonic fingerprint scanners are a cut above the rest, and not having it in a tablet that costs $1,000 feels criminal.\n\nAbove the display is a 12MP selfie camera positioned where it should be, along the long edge where the power buttons are. Video calling on the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is a great experience. The display and camera work to give you and the person you call a good time.\n\nZac Kew-Denniss / Android Authority\n\nThere’s more to this tablet than just the display. The aluminum shell feels mostly sturdy, although my unit makes an odd popping sound when I pick it up from the left side. Aside from that, this tablet’s fit, finish, and build are exceptional and rivals anything else in this price range. Like the front, the rear of the Tab S10 Plus will be familiar to you if you’ve used any of Samsung’s tablets of the last few years. Like the Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 before it and the S25 series after it, the only visual difference between the Tab S10 Plus and its predecessor is a set of rings around the cameras. I think the rings suit the tablet more than the aforementioned phones. Unlike those devices with black rings, the Tab S10 Plus’ camera rings are color-matched to the tablet.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Plus’ quad AKG-tuned speakers sound incredible. There are plenty of tablets that get loud, but most lose any semblance of quality when you get above 80% volume. Not so with this tablet. The speakers sound rich and dynamic anywhere in the volume range, and the Tab S10 Plus has become the go-to device in the kitchen, even for my wife, who, despite being a Samsung fangirl when it comes to phones, usually ignores any tablet that doesn’t have an Apple logo. Whether I’m listening to the new Linkin Park album for the thousandth time or relishing the dulcet tones of Kelsey Grammar as I rewatch Frasier (the original one, I have taste), this tablet is built for media consumption above all else.\n\nZac Kew-Denniss / Android Authority\n\nThe S Pen is one of the stars of the show here. Unlike the Galaxy S25 Ultra, where the stylus is starting to feel like an afterthought, the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus has some wonderful little touches that make using the S Pen better. To charge the S Pen and stow it away long-term, it sticks to the back beside the cameras, with wireless charging coils inside the tablet charging up the stylus. Reaching around the back for the S Pen can become a chore, though, especially if you only want to put it away briefly. That’s why I’m pleased to see that the three corners of this tablet that don’t house buttons have magnets for the S Pen. You can easily click it into place briefly and pick it back up without reaching behind the device or messing with a case.\n\nPerformance has been a bright spot, too. I was slightly concerned when I saw that the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus would use a MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus over a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, but I was pleasantly surprised. The Tab S10 Plus feels as fast and responsive as my 8 Gen 3-equipped Galaxy S24 Ultra. Working in Lightroom, playing games like Knights Of The Old Republic (admittedly an old title), and multi-tasking with three apps in split screen and a myriad more in pop-up windows has been a breeze. The 12GB of RAM enables the Dimensity 9300 Plus to power through tasks.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Plus doesn't have Snapdragon, but it's still a powerhouse.\n\nBattery life has been okay. It’s not as good as what my 2020 iPad Pro 11 could do when it was brand new five years ago, but it’s decent enough. The 10,090mAh cell is big enough to keep the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus running, but I’ve found I need to charge it once a day. I don’t go easy on it, using the tablet to play music or TV shows next to my desk with the screen and speakers cranked. Intersperse that with editing photos in Lightroom, managing my tasks in Tick Tick, playing some KOTOR during my lunch break, and running all my timers while we cook dinner, and the tablet being on 25-30% 24 hours after I last unplugged it isn’t bad at all. If you’re a lighter user, I could see it running well into a second day.\n\nThe charging is adequate. It’s 45W once you buy a charger, and it takes about 90 minutes to charge it fully. That’s not bad; 45W is how fast the Galaxy S25 Ultra charges with the right charger. But that has a battery that is half the size and is still far behind the charging speeds companies like OnePlus offer. Because the battery life is solid, it doesn’t always matter if the battery isn’t full when you unplug it, but even so, it would be nice to see faster charging across all of Samsung’s products.\n\nAll play, no work\n\nZac Kew-Denniss / Android Authority\n\nThe hardware on the Tab S10 Plus is damn near perfect. So is the software, as far as I’m concerned. One UI has been my favorite flavor of Android since it debuted on the Galaxy S10 (the phone), and it’s only gotten better. It’s packed with features, as Samsung’s software always is, but it’s paired back by a design language that makes sense and feels at home on a display this size. Its split-screen and pop-up window implementation is the best in the business, including what Apple has with iPadOS, and if the rest of the Android tablet ecosystem lived up to that, this would be an easy 10/10. But the app ecosystem for Android isn’t there for tablets. At least, not for everyone.\n\nDaVinci Resolve, Full Photoshop, and Procreate are just some examples of the apps that iPad users get that Android users don’t. Aside from Procreate, most people use the other apps mentioned on their laptops, but if they need to use an iPad for those tasks, they can. We’re an Android site, and you’re here to read about an Android tablet, but the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is $1,000, making the iPad Pro its only competitor. Productivity has to factor into my review of this tablet because why else would you be spending this much on one? If you want a big display and good speakers to enjoy media, the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus FE gets you 85% of the experience for $400 less.\n\nThere is more to being productive than video editing or Photoshop, though. Adobe Lightroom works great on the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus; I used it to edit the photos in this review. There’s also the S Pen, which I prefer to the Apple Pencil in many ways. There isn’t a drawing app that truly rivals Procreate, but Infinite Painter comes pretty close, and Samsung Notes rivals Apple Notes.\n\nZac Kew-Denniss / Android Authority\n\nA bonus in Samsung’s corner is DeX. Apple was so proud of Stage Manager for the iPad, but it doesn’t come close to DeX, which, as the name suggests, offers a full desktop environment for the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus. It isn’t perfect by any means. I tried to switch to it exclusively when my PC died recently, and it couldn’t quite do everything I needed. But it’s leaps and bounds ahead of Stage Manager and is a value add if it can fit into your workflow.\n\nIt feels like Chrome OS once you have a keyboard and mouse connected (or a keyboard case — though Samsung’s official options are quite pricey). Unfortunately, my experience with DeX wasn’t the best. If all you need to do is write in Google Docs or Gmail, it’s a good experience. I needed to do more than that, and sadly, the mobile version of Chrome can’t handle WordPress, the CMS I use to write articles like this one. While I have other issues with iPadOS, such as connecting it to my 16:9 monitor without pillarboxing and Stage Manager, the iPad’s version of Safari can at least load WordPress properly.\n\nI don’t want to sound overly harsh on DeX. I like it and use it a lot. It’s very good for basic tasks, but it needs some help from Google. Android tablets deserve to have the full desktop version of Chrome, and until that happens, DeX feels like it’s being held back.\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nSoftware updates are another area where the Tab S10 Plus both excels and simultaneously disappoints. Samsung has promised the Galaxy Tab S10 series the same seven years of software support that Samsung’s flagship phones receive. Naturally, that’s good to see. So, why do I have an issue with the Tab S10 Plus’ software updates? Because they’re quarterly. My Galaxy S25 gets a monthly security patch and will do so for seven years. This tablet will only get four updates per year, leaving its security bulletin out of date more often than not.\n\nTo put into perspective how annoying this is, my mother’s Galaxy A52 5G, a modest mid-range phone from 2021, got monthly security patches until June last year, when it was depreciated to quarterly updates. If a low-cost smartphone like the A52 5G could get monthly updates for most of its life, why can’t a tablet that costs $1,000? And what of the future? When the Tab S10 Plus is older, as the A52 5G now is, will it see those updates become bi-quaterly instead?\n\nI have always been happy with One UI and how it’s been updated over the years, but the delays to One UI 7 and the way this tablet is being treated leaves a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10 review verdict: Is it worth it?\n\nZac Kew-Denniss / Android Authority\n\nYes — if you understand what you’re buying. The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is the best Android tablet for media, second only to the larger Tab S10 Ultra ($1199.99 at Samsung). The screen is crisp, the anti-reflective coating means it’s more than usable outdoors even without a high peak brightness, and the 120Hz is as smooth as expected. The speakers are a highlight, filling a room with high-quality sound, and the S Pen is my favorite stylus, one that I would pick over any version of the Apple Pencil. That makes it the perfect tablet for people like me who want the absolute best hardware while staying in the Android ecosystem.\n\nFor almost anyone else, though, the answer is no. If you’re spending $1,000 on a tablet because you want the best and you’re operating system agnostic, the iPad Pro offers better value. If you want a tablet for media consumption and don’t mind the small differences, the Tab S10 FE provides 90% of this experience for much less money.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is the best Android tablet for media, second only to the larger Tab S10 Ultra.\n\nUltimately, what holds this tablet back has nothing to do with Samsung. It’s a tale as old as time. Android tablets do not receive the same developer focus as the iPad. There are some exceptions, like most of Meta’s apps, sans Threads, supporting Android tablets while leaving the iPad out to dry. However, those are the exceptions, and unless Google and Samsung find a way to make Android tablets attractive to developers, nothing will change.\n\nFor $1,000, you could buy a decent laptop and the aforementioned Tab S10 FE ($499.99 at Amazon), undoubtedly an option that offers better value. But I’d still take the Tab S10 Plus. Unlike most people, I can see, hear, and feel the difference between a flagship tablet like this and a mid-range one. For you and I, the people who can enjoy this tablet despite the things holding it back, it’s a beautiful piece of hardware I enjoy using daily.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus Big battery • Bright display • Precision input MSRP: $999.99 Portable productivity The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus offers up a beautiful 12.4-inch display, high-resolution stylus input, and enough power to replace a small laptop.

The Anfield Index podcast, hosted by Trev Downey and featuring Liverpool legend Jan Molby, turned its attention to Sunday’s clash with a clarity that cuts through the noise. It’s no longer about perfection. It’s about survival, resilience, and finding form when it matters most.\n\nWest Ham’s Form Offers Hope – But Also a Warning\n\nThe Hammers arrive at Anfield languishing in 16th place, but Jan Molby was quick to dismiss the notion of a straightforward encounter: “Of course they can hurt us with the quality they’ve got… they might be motivated by a full Anfield.”\n\nDespite recent results – a draw against Bournemouth and defeats to Wolves and Newcastle – the quality in West Ham’s ranks isn’t in question. Players like Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Paquetá and Jarrod Bowen possess the flair and force to cause problems. However, Molby identified the real issue: “I just don’t see any players who’ve stepped up and ran with it. Nobody’s really helping the manager.”\n\nWest Ham’s malaise might offer an opening, but only if Liverpool rediscover the structure and sharpness they’ve lacked in recent games. “We are a little unrecognisable at the moment,” Molby admitted, referencing the team’s sluggish performances against Southampton, PSG, and Fulham.\n\nLiverpool’s Selections and Slot’s Trust Issues\n\nMuch of the discussion turned to Arne Slot’s squad choices – or more accurately, the limits of his trust. “He clearly has four lads he trusts in midfield and no more,” Molby observed. “And one of them is being used as a right-back.”\n\nConnor Bradley is expected to return to the starting XI after Curtis Jones’ stint at right-back “didn’t work.” Molby was blunt: “To play as a full-back in an away game… I was not a big fan of that decision.”\n\nIn midfield, there’s pressure on Alexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch to offer energy and control, with Molby suggesting a possible rest for the fading Dominik Szoboszlai. “It wouldn’t surprise me if he’s left out and Curtis starts ahead of him,” Molby added.\n\nUp front, the choices are as plentiful as they are problematic. “Our front guys are all out of form,” Molby said. “You’re judged on goals… and they’re not scoring at the moment.”\n\nHe predicted a front three of Salah, Díaz and Jota, despite his concerns about Jota’s inconsistency. “Could he want to give Jota another go at home after he scored against Everton?” he pondered, before admitting even Darwin Nunez’s cameo against Fulham was “pretty awful.”\n\nVan Dijk and Salah’s Influence Will Be Vital\n\nMolby was clear that Liverpool need more from their biggest names – and soon. “You do always look towards your leaders,” he said, pointing to recent underwhelming showings from both Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk.\n\nOn Van Dijk: “It’s baffling… it’s not really part of what you do, making mistakes, if you’re Virgil.”\n\nOn Salah: “He’s a moment player… but he hasn’t produced those moments in recent games.”\n\nYet both players have a chance to reset the tone against West Ham, especially amid positive noises about new contracts. “Liverpool shouldn’t lose a player they want to keep,” Molby said, referencing reports that both Salah and Van Dijk are nearing extensions. “It sends the right signal to our fans.”\n\nFinding a Way to Win – However it Looks\n\nDespite the inconsistency, Molby’s message was clear: Liverpool can and should find a way. “We used to say it early in the season – we’ll find a way of winning the game. And I think we’re back to that.”\n\nIt won’t be about aesthetics. It’s about points. “I think there might be one or two hairy moments… but whatever is going to be needed, Anfield will give us a big hand.”\n\nHis final prediction? “3-1 to Liverpool.”\n\nA simple scoreline. A complex match. But with seven Sundays to go and the title still mathematically possible, every performance from here must be a statement."}

Speaking to Ma… [+3546 chars]", "title": "Agent ‘Would Love’ Liverpool Star to Follow Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid", "fullContent": "Liverpool Star’s Agent Makes Interesting Real Madrid Claim\n\nThe waves of speculation around Liverpool’s Ryan Gravenberch potentially joining Real Madrid have intensified, thanks in no small part to recent comments from his agent, Jose Rodriguez. Speaking to Marca, Rodriguez candidly discussed the allure of the LaLiga giants, despite acknowledging the substantial challenge in prying Gravenberch away from Anfield.\n\n“When Ryan was 16, Barca called us. They wanted to sign him, but his father and I prioritized his development,” Rodriguez revealed, highlighting the player’s early brush with top-tier interest. The development path they chose for him at Ajax has evidently paid dividends, fostering a talent that is now integral to Liverpool’s ambitions.\n\nRodriguez’s Real Madrid Dream\n\nRodriguez doesn’t hide his aspirations for Gravenberch, stating, “He’s good enough for Real Madrid,” and expressing a clear desire for the move. “We would love for him to play for them, but Liverpool would ask for a lot of money. I know they’ve had their eye on him, but now it’s impossible.”\n\nThe word “impossible” might not deter Madrid, known for their persistence and deep pockets when a target catches their eye. However, Liverpool’s valuation of Gravenberch, rumoured to be around £80m, underscores his importance to the team and the financial strength Liverpool has been displaying.\n\nGravenberch’s Commitment Amid Speculation\n\nDespite the swirling transfer talk, Gravenberch remains a steadfast contributor to Liverpool’s cause. His performances under manager Arne Slot have been particularly noteworthy. “The coach gave me confidence when I needed it and I’m happy that I can show myself again,” Gravenberch shared with TNT Sports, reflecting on his gratitude and focus amid the speculation.\n\nGravenberch’s consistent appearances and his evolving role as a defensive midfielder have not only bolstered Liverpool’s midfield but also showcased his adaptability and resilience—qualities that do not go unnoticed by clubs like Real Madrid.\n\nLooking Forward: What’s Next for Gravenberch?\n\nFor now, Gravenberch is all in on Liverpool’s Premier League title chase. His contract, extending till 2028, and the club’s current standing make an immediate move unlikely. Yet, in football, the winds of change are ever-present, and the allure of a club like Real Madrid can sway even the most grounded narratives.\n\nAs Liverpool fans watch this saga unfold, they’ll be hoping that Gravenberch’s immediate future remains firmly at Anfield, contributing to the club’s success and perhaps even growing into a legendary figure in the red part of Merseyside.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThe news of Ryan Gravenberch potentially eyeing a move to Real Madrid, as reported by Marca, stirs a pot of frustration among Liverpool supporters. It’s becoming a tedious pattern, seeing our standout talents linked with moves away, particularly to a club like Real Madrid, which almost seems like a rite of passage for top players seeking to cement their legacy.\n\nAs Liverpool fans, we’re tired of our club being seen as a stepping stone. Gravenberch has developed into a key player under Arne Slot’s guidance, and losing him could be a significant setback. While Rodriguez talks about dreams and impossibilities, the harsh reality for us is the potential disruption to our squad’s balance and the undermining of our campaign to return to the top of English and European football.\n\nWe need to retain our best players if we are to build a team capable of consistent success. It’s high time the club’s hierarchy makes it clear that our top talents are here to stay, not just ripe picks for Europe’s elite. Gravenberch should remain a Red, and any talk of his exit only adds unnecessary distraction to our already challenging season."}

Despite Arsenal’s 2-0 win over Real Madrid, Hendrick pointed out the flaws in reading too much into the result.\n\n“They beat Real Madrid because Declan Rice scored two incredible free kicks,” he explained. “Declan Rice could play the rest of his career and in every single game have free kicks in exactly those positions and the chances of him scoring one, let alone both, would be very low.”\n\nHendrick highlighted that this Madrid side isn’t one to be revered. “This is not a vintage Real Madrid. This is the Real Madrid that we wiped the floor with.” He ran through a list of poor results from the Spanish giants this season, including a home loss to Valencia and draws against relegation-threatened sides.\n\nLiverpool’s League Form Stronger Than Fans Admit\n\nDespite nerves among the Anfield faithful, Hendrick reminded listeners that Liverpool are top of the league and have suffered just two defeats all season. “We’ve only had one bad result which is a 2-2 draw at home to Manchester United,” he stated. “Objectively speaking, that is our only flat-out bad result this season in the league.”\n\nHe added that the Reds’ other dropped points – including draws against Arsenal, Newcastle, and Fulham with ten men – weren’t signs of collapse. “You need to separate performance from results,” he said. “We’ve had a lot of bad performances… but only one bad result.”\n\nUpcoming Fixtures Favour Liverpool\n\nLooking ahead, Hendrick pointed out that Liverpool’s next three league games are against struggling sides – West Ham (16th), Leicester (19th), and Tottenham (14th). “This is one of the easier stretches of our entire season,” he stressed.\n\nDiscussing West Ham’s recent form, he noted, “Three wins in the last 12 games… what is it from these last 12 games that gives you the impression that this West Ham team are going to beat us?”\n\nOn Leicester: “Eight straight defeats. Leicester didn’t score any goals in these eight games.”\n\nAnd regarding Tottenham, Hendrick was cutting: “Since mid-December, they’ve won four Premier League matches from the last 16 games. What is it that you’re seeing that makes you think they’re beating us?”\n\nConfidence in Core Players, Despite Trent Uncertainty\n\nAddressing the contract situations, Hendrick shared optimism about Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. “It’s a matter of when, not if both Salah and Van Dijk sign,” he said, citing reports from David Ornstein.\n\nWhile acknowledging the likely loss of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Hendrick prioritised the other two. “Trent is third on that list… From a now, next season, season after point of view… it’s easier to find a really good right back than a really good centre-back or winger.”\n\nLiverpool supporters would do well to tune out the hysteria and trust in the team’s form, depth, and remaining fixture list. As Hendrick summarised, “If we win these three games, we will have the title wrapped up… and maybe then you can all take off your Depends and put back on normal underwear without the risk of soiling them.”"}

This decision comes amidst the Reds’ urgent need to find a replacement for Darwin Nunez, whose departure seems imminent after a disappointing stint at Anfield.\n\nUnattainable Goalscorer\n\nThe Reds have been left in a precarious position following Darwin Nunez’s inability to live up to expectations. Despite the Uruguayan’s hefty £85 million price tag, his output has been meagre, with only seven goals across 40 appearances this season. Mark Douglas of the iPaper expertly outlines the situation, noting Liverpool’s interest in Isak, who has impressed with 20 Premier League goals this season. However, Douglas states, “But any attempts to sign the Swede would prove futile for a number of reasons.”\n\nFormidable Newcastle Stance\n\nNewcastle’s firm stance on keeping Isak is rooted deeply in their future ambitions and current contractual leverage. Isak’s contract, which extends until 2028, along with planned talks to increase his wages, solidifies his position as a central figure in their project. Douglas remarks on the commitment of Newcastle’s chairman, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, to maintain the squad’s core, reflecting a clear directive to reject all offers for Isak.\n\nChampions League Aspirations and Financial Stability\n\nThe lure of Champions League football is a significant draw for any top player, and with Newcastle poised to secure a spot in this prestigious competition, their appeal only grows. Douglas points out, “With England allocated five Champions League spots for the 2025/26 season, it’s looking increasingly likely that the Magpies are going to qualify.” Furthermore, the financial aspect, coupled with Newcastle’s adherence to Profitability and Sustainability Rules, means they aren’t compelled to sell, thus strengthening their hand in negotiations.\n\nManagement and Cohesion at Newcastle\n\nThe leadership of Eddie Howe has been instrumental in fostering a unified squad, resistant to the allure of bigger clubs. Howe’s ability to manage player expectations and maintain harmony within the team has been a cornerstone of Newcastle’s resilience. Douglas adds, “Howe’s collaborative relationship with director of football Paul Mitchell has further solidified the club’s resolve.”\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs a Liverpool fan, the news about Isak is undeniably a blow. The team’s struggle in front of goal this season, combined with the pending departure of Nunez, paints a grim picture of the upcoming transfer window. It’s frustrating to see a club of Liverpool’s stature missing out on top talents, which only amplifies the pressure on manager Arne Slot to find viable alternatives.\n\nThe decision to not pursue Isak further, despite his proven Premier League capabilities, may be pragmatic given the financial and contractual complexities involved. However, it leaves fans questioning where the next reliable striker will come from, especially with rivals seemingly strengthening at a faster pace. This situation feels like a step back at a time when forward momentum is crucial, both on and off the pitch."}

It provided a jolt—perhaps a necessary one. Alexis Mac Allister, a quietly pivotal figure in Arne Slot’s midfield, knows that even in high-performing sides, complacency can creep in through the cracks.\n\nSpeaking to Liverpoolfc.com this week, Mac Allister offered an honest and introspective take on both the Fulham loss and the days since. “Plenty of time to analyse what happened… it was quite clear,” he said. That candour speaks volumes—not only about the player’s self-awareness but also about the culture Slot is cultivating: mistakes acknowledged, lessons internalised, and progress demanded.\n\nBenefit of Breathing Space\n\nIt’s not often Liverpool have an entire week without midweek commitments, and Mac Allister admits the unusual gap feels “weird.” But rather than lament the lack of European football, there’s a quiet determination in his voice.\n\n“I think there are things you can do on and off the pitch… especially prepare in a better way physically.” Those words highlight how vital rest and focused sessions can be, particularly during a run-in where every fixture feels like a final. This week’s preparation, Mac Allister says, has been “really good.” If Liverpool are to reclaim top spot, this stretch of calm between storms may prove decisive.\n\nMargins, Mistakes and Mentality\n\nDespite the defeat, Mac Allister’s goal at Craven Cottage—a thunderous, almost balletic strike—was a reminder of his growing influence. Now just one goal shy of last season’s tally, he downplays personal milestones. “I don’t set any targets before the season… but I really like getting goals and assists.”\n\nThat humility, coupled with a hunger for improvement, is why Slot has trusted him so deeply. His reflection on the Fulham match reinforces how split-second decisions—right or wrong—can shape outcomes. “I think it was just about those minutes, those mistakes… it can happen. At the end, it’s football.”\n\nBut here’s where Mac Allister offers real insight: he doesn’t hide behind the vagueness of ‘bad luck’ or ‘tough day.’ Instead, he returns to mindset: “We have the mentality and the group to get up and go again on Sunday.” That may well be the most important line of all.\n\nWest Ham, Potter and What Comes Next\n\nLiverpool’s clash with Graham Potter’s evolving West Ham side is far from a formality. “They’re a completely different team,” Mac Allister says. He would know—having worked with Potter at Brighton, he’s aware of the tactical evolution and technical precision Potter demands.\n\nWith only four home games remaining, the need to make Anfield a fortress is urgent. But there’s belief in the synergy between players and fans. “They will make it special, like always,” Mac Allister says. “If we are all together it’s going to be easier.”\n\nWhether Liverpool win the title may not hinge on style or star power alone. It may come down to mindset—and in Mac Allister, they have a leader who refuses to flinch.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThere’s a quiet steel about Alexis Mac Allister that Liverpool fans are really starting to admire. No drama, no headlines—just consistent excellence. That Fulham goal wasn’t just another highlight for the season’s reel; it was a statement that he’s not just a cog in the system but increasingly the heartbeat of Slot’s midfield.\n\nWhat resonates from this interview isn’t just tactical reflection—it’s emotional intelligence. There’s a maturity in how he speaks about disappointment, a composure that suggests he gets the pressure and relishes the responsibility. You can see why he was Slot’s trusted choice to keep things ticking, especially in high-stakes games.\n\nHis familiarity with Graham Potter could give Liverpool an edge on Sunday. And his point about the Anfield crowd? Bang on. The crowd know what’s at stake. With four games left at home, they’ll be louder than ever. That connection—Mac Allister to the Kop—might just be the thread that ties this title push together.\n\nThere’s a long way to go, but if Liverpool do go on to lift the trophy, don’t be surprised if Mac Allister’s quiet leadership is mentioned just as often as any last-minute goal or headline-making save."}

With an 11-point lead, the Reds are poised to interrupt Manchester City’s four-year winning streak and claim the crown for themselves.\n\nStrategic Moves Seal Dominance\n\nLiverpool’s mastery over the league has been evident, yet recent weeks have seen a slight falter in their stride. Despite this, their trajectory remains firmly set towards lifting the trophy. Such a victory would mark the end of City’s consecutive successes and serve as a blow to Arsenal’s ambitions, who, despite their efforts, are likely to secure a second-place finish for the third year running.\n\nAmid these developments, the Reds’ strategic foresight in securing key players’ futures spells trouble for their closest rivals. Pundit Paul Merson encapsulated the sentiment perfectly, stating, “Massive, huge. I didn’t expect any of them to sign if I’m being honest. To get them two signed up with the amount of money they’d have been losing every week from not signing which could have two years ago, phenomenal. Bad news for Arsenal, bad news for Man City, bad news for Chelsea.”\n\nLiverpool’s Tactical Edge: Keeping Salah and Van Dijk\n\nLiverpool’s recent maneuvers in the transfer market underscore a significant victory off the pitch—Mohamed Salah and Virgil Van Dijk are on the brink of signing new contracts. This move not only reassures the Liverpool faithful but also sends a stark warning to competitors like Manchester City and Arsenal, who may have been counting on a weakened Reds lineup come next season.\n\nWith Salah and Van Dijk nearly secured, Liverpool can approach the summer transfer window with a clear focus, unburdened by the need to scout immediate replacements for these key players. This stability allows the club to enhance other areas of the squad where reinforcement is necessary, such as the left-back, centre-forward, and right-back positions.\n\nCrafting a Robust Squad for Future Challenges\n\nThe assurance of continuity in Liverpool’s lineup, provided by the retention of Salah and Van Dijk, permits a strategic approach to the upcoming transfer period. The Reds are set to reinforce their squad depth while maintaining the core that has brought them considerable success, ensuring they remain formidable contenders in the next season.\n\nIn conclusion, as Liverpool looks to cement their status as Premier League champions, the securing of key players’ futures not only augurs well for their immediate prospects but also fortifies their position as a powerhouse in English football. The implications of these strategic signings will resonate far beyond the confines of Anfield, setting the stage for continued success and dominance in the challenging seasons to come."}

Among the prominent names linked with a move to Anfield is Victor Osimhen, a player whose capabilities and potential impact are worth a detailed examination. According to ESPN, Liverpool could secure Osimhen for about £55 million—a fee that seems a bargain in today’s inflated market.\n\nOsimhen as a Focal Point in Liverpool’s Attack\n\nWith Darwin Nunez likely to depart and uncertainties surrounding the futures of Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz, Liverpool’s attack is on the brink of a significant overhaul. Osimhen, currently on loan at Galatasaray from Napoli, has emerged as a prime candidate to lead the line for the Reds. His impressive tally of 28 goals in 32 games this season highlights his prowess and suitability to be the new No. 9 at Anfield. His track record at Napoli, with an average of better than a goal every two games, further cements his status as a top-tier striker.\n\nLiverpool’s manager, Arne Slot, is tasked with reinforcing the squad, and Osimhen fits the profile Liverpool desires in a striker—efficient, lethal, and cost-effective. In contrast to the exorbitant £150 million Newcastle has tagged on Alexander Isak, Osimhen represents a financially sensible alternative without compromising on quality.\n\nFinancial Implications and Market Dynamics\n\nThe financial aspect of Osimhen’s transfer is particularly intriguing. With a price tag of £55 million, he stands as a stark contrast to the current market rates for players of similar calibre. This strategic financial planning could allow Liverpool to allocate resources to strengthen other areas of the squad as well, considering that multiple positions are expected to see new faces.\n\nThe broader implications of such a transfer extend beyond just the financials. Acquiring a player like Osimhen could signal Liverpool’s intent to compete at the highest level, both domestically and in European competitions, by building a team capable of consistency and resilience.\n\nImpact on Team Dynamics and Future Prospects\n\nIntegrating Osimhen into Liverpool’s setup could rejuvenate the team’s attacking dynamics. His ability to slot into the No. 9 role and instantly take on the goal-scoring responsibilities could be crucial for Liverpool, especially with potential exits from key forwards. The transition under manager Arne Slot would ideally be seamless, with Osimhen adapting quickly to Liverpool’s high-energy, pressing style of play.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs Liverpool fans, the prospect of Victor Osimhen joining our ranks is an exciting one. His impressive goal-scoring record this season with Galatasaray and during his tenure at Napoli showcases the kind of impact he could have at Anfield. Given the expected departures of key players like Nunez, Osimhen’s arrival could be a timely boost for the club.\n\nThe price tag of £55 million quoted by ESPN seems like a wise investment in today’s market, where players of lesser ability are fetching similar or higher fees. This move would not only fill the void left by departing players but could potentially elevate Liverpool’s attack to new heights, giving us an edge in both domestic and European campaigns.\n\nIn conclusion, Victor Osimhen represents more than just a potential new signing; he embodies the type of ambitious acquisition that could shape Liverpool’s fortunes in the upcoming seasons. The excitement and optimism around his possible arrival are palpable among the fanbase, and rightly so."}

After limping off in a match against PSG, the defender has been sidelined with an ankle injury. But the physical ailment isn’t the only thing keeping Alexander-Arnold in the headlines. According to a report by Lewis Steele for The Daily Mail, he is on the brink of a move to Real Madrid as a free agent, a decision stirring considerable commotion among fans and pundits alike, including Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher.\n\nAs Steele highlights, “With Alexander-Arnold’s decision causing a stir with the likes of Jamie Carragher and the Liverpool supporters, the England international will be walking into a completely different atmosphere when the fullback returns from injury.” This impending shift poses a significant question: How will Alexander-Arnold be received upon his return?\n\nTimeline for Recovery and Impact on Liverpool\n\nThe timeline for Alexander-Arnold’s return is somewhat vague, but he is expected to rejoin Liverpool later this month. This return could be crucial for Liverpool as they push for the Premier League title. The Daily Mail reports, “With supporters putting up posters aimed at Alexander-Arnold ahead of the defender’s potential move to Madrid, the England superstar will be returning to a completely different environment at Liverpool once back to full fitness.”\n\nThis situation puts additional pressure on Alexander-Arnold, who has not yet resumed full training and might need a few more weeks to increase his workload. His comeback could be the boost Liverpool needs to clinch the title, especially considering their relatively healthy squad status compared to rivals like Arsenal and Manchester City.\n\nBroader Injury Concerns at Liverpool\n\nAside from Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool’s injury woes have been minimal this season, which has played a significant role in their success. The only other notable injury is Joe Gomez, who remains out. Fortunately for the Reds, key player Alisson Becker is expected to return from a concussion to face West Ham this Sunday.\n\nFan Sentiment and Future Prospects\n\nThe atmosphere around Alexander-Arnold’s return and potential departure will be intriguing. The reaction from the fans, coupled with his performance on the pitch, will likely influence the narrative around Liverpool’s season and Alexander-Arnold’s future career path.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs a Liverpool fan, it’s a mixed bag when it comes to Trent Alexander-Arnold’s situation. On one hand, his impending departure to Madrid is a hard pill to swallow. It’s difficult to see one of our own, a product of the Liverpool academy, preparing to don another club’s colours. However, there’s no denying the tremendous impact Trent has had at Liverpool and the potential void his departure might leave.\n\nYet, in typical Liverpool spirit, there’s always a glimmer of hope. His return to the pitch this month could not only rekindle some fond memories for the fans but also solidify our title hopes. If Trent can channel all the ongoing noise into a series of standout performances, it could turn the tide in favour of a fairy-tale end to our Premier League campaign.\n\nUnder Arne Slot’s management, the team has shown resilience and adaptability. While the thought of losing such a talented player is daunting, Liverpool has always been about the collective strength. We thrive on challenges and, who knows, this might just be the catalyst needed for a new hero to emerge from within our ranks.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trent’s saga is bittersweet, it’s the Liverpool way to look forward. With or without him, we believe in our ability to march on. Anfield is more than just one player, and our history is testament to our enduring spirit. Let’s rally behind the team and push towards ending the season on a high note."}

This wasn’t a rant-filled post-mortem, but a measured look at a team struggling to rediscover itself at the season’s sharp end. With Mo Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold all under the microscope – both on and off the pitch – Molby didn’t hold back.\n\nVan Dijk: From Rock to Rattled\n\nVirgil van Dijk’s recent drop-off wasn’t brushed under the rug. “It’s almost like a subconscious thing where it’s done now,” Molby said of the Dutchman’s uncharacteristic performances, particularly in the recent defeat to Fulham. “It’s baffling,” he admitted. “If you’re Virgil van Dijk… it’s not really part of what you do, making mistakes.”\n\nWhat stood out was how Molby linked this downturn to a possible lack of urgency. “There isn’t one result that will change the outcome of us winning the title… so possibly we are just missing this ‘make sure you’re ready’ moment.” He stopped short of blaming Van Dijk directly but noted that when leaders drop off, the entire team can suffer: “You do always look towards your leaders.”\n\nMo Salah: The Moment Man\n\nMo Salah has also been under scrutiny despite what many still consider a strong season statistically. Molby, however, offered some nuance: “Mo is a moment player… you’ll never come away from Anfield and say, ‘Did you see the way Mo controlled the game today?’”\n\nIt’s not a criticism, more a reflection of Salah’s profile. “He’s not in the game for 90 minutes, but he scores goals that win games,” Molby said, pointing out that fatigue or form might be affecting him, but it’s easier to explain than Van Dijk’s slide. “He’s put it all in,” he added, acknowledging Salah’s dedication to his fitness this campaign.\n\nTrent and Slot: System vs Suitability\n\nMolby was candid when analysing Trent Alexander-Arnold’s situation. Speaking on Arne Slot’s approach to squad management, he highlighted the risk of overthinking tactical solutions: “I’m not a big fan of playing Curtis [Jones] at right-back in an away game. It’s an accident waiting to happen.”\n\nThe broader point? Slot has his trusted core – and isn’t deviating from it. “He clearly has four lads he trusts in midfield and no more,” Molby observed. It’s not a ringing endorsement of Liverpool’s depth, especially given “the manager doesn’t fancy [Endo]… unless something dramatically happens this summer.”\n\nContract Clarity – Finally?\n\nPerhaps the biggest talking point from the podcast was the encouraging update on contract talks for Van Dijk and Salah. Molby welcomed the shift from “if” to “when”, calling the prospect of extending both players’ deals “massive.” He went on: “Liverpool shouldn’t lose a player they want to keep. We should be attractive and proactive enough.”\n\nIn Molby’s eyes, keeping Salah and Van Dijk doesn’t just retain quality – it helps attract it too: “They’ve played against Mo and Virgil – they know what they’re like. It’s a bloody nightmare.”\n\nHowever, the silence around Trent’s contract was a concern. “If he’s not joining Real Madrid, it’s some job they’ve done on Real Madrid to make them believe he was coming,” Molby said with a wry chuckle, acknowledging the growing inevitability of his departure.\n\nFinal Whistle\n\nIn a revealing and thoughtful episode, Jan Molby brought the reality of Liverpool’s current fragility into focus. With Van Dijk’s form dipping, Salah’s influence waning, and Trent’s future clouded in uncertainty, the club’s biggest names are carrying big questions. Yet there was optimism too – not blind hope, but faith in the strength that still exists within the squad. “We’ll find a way,” Molby concluded. For now, that’s what Liverpool fans are clinging to."}

Among their interests, River Plate’s Franco Mastantuono, a youthful prodigy from Argentina, is making headlines.\n\nScouting Future Stars\n\nMarcelo Benedetto, a reputable source, recently highlighted Liverpool’s keen interest in Mastantuono. The club’s scouting network is reportedly keeping a close eye on him as the June transfer window approaches. At just 17 years old, Mastantuono has already made a significant impact, accumulating 41 appearances for the River Plate senior team.\n\nTweets by m_benedetto\n\nA left-footed attacking midfielder, Mastantuono excels in central areas, drawing comparisons to some of Argentina’s most technically gifted players. Born in Azul, Argentina, he stands out not only for his skill but for his rapid progression through the ranks at River Plate. His journey began in 2019 at the academy, and by August 2023, he had signed his first professional contract, initially featuring a €30 million release clause.\n\nRising Value and International Recognition\n\nThis clause has since increased to €45 million, reflecting his growing stature and potential. At a national level, Mastantuono’s prowess was evident early on. He earned a spot in Argentina’s U17 squad at just 14 and progressed to the U20 team by 16. His record-breaking feats at River Plate, including becoming their youngest-ever goal-scorer, have only bolstered his reputation.\n\nLiverpool’s technical staff views him as a perfect fit—a creative midfielder adept at navigating tight spaces, which aligns with the club’s strategic needs.\n\nCompetition Heats Up\n\nHowever, Liverpool is not alone in their pursuit. Manchester City and Manchester United have also considered Mastantuono, and Inter Milan is preparing an offer. Real Madrid showed initial interest but has since stepped back following his new contract with River Plate, which includes a €40 million release clause.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs Liverpool fans, the prospect of Franco Mastantuono joining our ranks is incredibly exciting. Under Arne Slot’s management, we’ve seen a focus on nurturing young talent and playing a dynamic, forward-thinking style of football. Mastantuono, with his technical abilities and early showings on an international stage, seems like an ideal candidate to thrive under Slot’s guidance.\n\nGiven the competition from other top clubs, securing Mastantuono would be a significant coup. It’s also a statement of intent from Liverpool’s management, demonstrating our commitment to building a future-proof squad. While the financial aspect is substantial, investing in such a promising talent could yield high returns both on and off the pitch.\n\nAs Liverpool fans, we must remain optimistic yet realistic about the challenges in landing a player like Mastantuono. The involvement of Manchester clubs and Inter Milan certainly complicates the negotiations, but Liverpool has a history of successful strategic moves in the transfer market under Richard Hughes. Our hope is that if Mastantuono does land at Anfield, he will be a transformative figure, embodying the club’s ethos and propelling us to new heights in the coming seasons."}

However, there seems to be much speculation about significant squad changes in the upcoming summer transfer window. These changes are anticipated to reshape the forward ranks specifically, where challenges have been evident.\n\nScrutinising Darwin Nunez’s Future\n\nDarwin Nunez has had a notably difficult season, with minimal impact in his appearances. Starting only seven Premier League matches and scoring four goals across all competitions, his role under Slot has been significantly diminished. As reported, Nunez’s future at Liverpool remains uncertain after failing to align with the expected performance levels, prompting thoughts about a possible departure from Anfield.\n\nLuis Diaz’s Wavering Form\n\nLuis Diaz’s journey this season mirrors a troubling inconsistency. Despite his technical prowess, his contribution in crucial moments has been lacking. With only one goal in 18 appearances before the international break, concerns about his long-term place at Liverpool have intensified. According to journalist Lewis Steele for the Daily Mail, there is speculation about interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia, adding more uncertainty to his continuing presence at Liverpool.\n\nTransfer Rumours and Realities\n\nThe Anfield side has been linked with several forwards, including Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap and Brighton’s Joao Pedro. However, Lewis Steele reports, “Liam Delap at Ipswich has been mentioned a lot, but I do not think he is a viable candidate – a great player, though – and Joao Pedro of Brighton is similar.” This clarification indicates that despite the rumours, no concrete moves are being made for these players at this stage.\n\nImpact on Liverpool’s Strategy\n\nWith key players potentially exiting and the current links to other forwards proving unsubstantiated, Liverpool might have to look elsewhere to bolster their attacking options. The club’s strategy in the transfer market will be crucial in maintaining their competitive edge, especially with the tactical demands of Arne Slot’s system.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs avid supporters of Liverpool, the current transfer rumours bring a mix of concern and anticipation. While the potential departure of Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz might seem a setback, it could also be an opportunity to revitalise the squad with fresh talent. Nunez’s lack of integration into Slot’s tactical framework and Diaz’s inconsistency are clear indicators that changes might be beneficial.\n\nThe rumours surrounding Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, though now quelled, suggest the club is exploring all avenues. However, as fans, we must trust in Slot’s vision and the club’s recruitment strategy to ensure that any new signings not only fill the void left by departing players but also enhance the team’s dynamics.\n\nGiven the expected outgoings, Liverpool’s management needs to be particularly astute in their dealings. The club should aim for players who can adapt quickly to Slot’s methodologies and contribute immediately to the team’s objectives. The importance of maintaining momentum after a potential title-winning season cannot be overstated, and the right signings will be key to achieving sustained success.\n\nIn conclusion, while the rumour mill will continue to churn, it’s crucial that Liverpool’s decisions in the upcoming transfer window are made with a clear strategic vision, ensuring that the squad not only remains competitive but also evolves to meet the challenges of the ever-demanding Premier League."}

Today, I’m going to share the story of the process behind writing my book.\n\nThe Beginning of the Story\n\nMy book, 100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them, was published in August 2022. But the story starts much earlier, back in 2018.\n\nAt this time, I was working in Switzerland, refactoring a C++ legacy codebase. Together with my colleague and friend Damien Chambon, we started evaluating Scala and Akka (an actor model framework) for a potential rewrite. Why Scala and Akka, you may wonder? Well, back then I had mostly Java/JVM experience, and I was intrigued by the promises of the actor model.\n\nBut things were… definitely not simple. First off, it was a whole new language to learn. Second, Akka is a beast. It takes time to ramp up, and we even had to hire an external consultant to help with the implementation. After months of work, we finally had our first PoC. And yet, neither my colleague nor I were really convinced.\n\nSo, we started looking at another language to counterbalance Scala. Maybe this new one wasn’t the sexiest language ever invented, but it looks promising, efficient, and much easier to ramp up with: Go.\n\nAfter just a couple of weeks in Go, we were able to cover the same scope as our Scala/Akka PoC. And for me, that was the beginning of a love story with the Go programming language.\n\nA few months passed, and I moved to another company and another country: the UK. I was back working in a Java ecosystem since my Go experience was still too limited to land a proper job. Plus, given the international move, the company itself mattered more to me than the tech stack.\n\nThat experience turned out to be horrendous. It was full of politics, and I hated every aspect of my job. But in the evenings, I kept working on personal projects in Go. After just three months, I decided to stop the bleeding and move on to another company.\n\nThis time, I was determined to get a Go job. It was May 2019. I signed to a new company, and finally, I could develop in Go all day long.\n\nA Blog Post That Changes Everything\n\nAfter four months in this new company, I noticed that some of my colleagues were making the same mistakes I made when I was working in Switzerland.\n\nSo, I decided to write a blog post listing common mistakes in Go called The Top 10 Most Common Mistakes I’ve Seen in Go Projects.\n\nLet’s be honest: the title was way more ambitious than my actual experience. Reading it, you would expect someone with deep Go expertise, right? But the truth is, when I said “projects“, it meant:\n\nThe PoC my colleague and I wrote in Go\n\nThe four months I had spent at my new company\n\nNothing too crazy, really. I didn’t have big ambitions for the post, but I love writing, and I thought it might be interesting to share. So I published it on Medium.\n\nUnexpectedly, the post became very popular: 4.7k claps, trending on r/golang, and even listed as one of the top articles of 2019 by Golang Weekly, the most well-known Go newsletter:\n\nAt this point, I’m starting to believe that writing about mistakes seems to interest people. So my train of thought was: let’s keep collecting mistakes and see how it goes. Perhaps at some point, I could write a GitHub repo that would contain all my findings?\n\n16 Months of Work and a First Contact With Manning\n\nFast forward to November 2020. It had been 16 months since I published my blog post, and by then, I had collected 100 mistakes in Go. During that time, I gathered mistakes from various sources, mainly:\n\nAt work (to be honest, I was also a significant source of inspiration!)\n\nIn various studies and blog posts\n\nIn different open-source projects\n\nAt this stage, I felt much more confident about my project. Sure, an open-source repository could be great, but I wondered: why not go for a book? Being someone who loves reading and writing, I had always dreamed of publishing my own.\n\nI contacted only one publisher: Manning. Why Manning? Here’s what I wrote in my book:\n\nDo I see Manning as a high-quality publisher? Absolutely. Is that the only reason why I contacted only Manning? Maybe not.\n\nBack then, to propose an idea to O’Reilly (not sure if it has changed since), you had to fill out a document containing hundreds and hundreds of pages! OK, maybe my memory is playing tricks on me, and it was just a dozen pages, but I remember thinking: “This is too much effort.“\n\nWhereas with Manning? A simple email was enough:\n\nSomething funny to highlight here. In this email, I was saying, “I’m at 80%” because for most of the mistakes, I already had some content written:\n\nThe mistake itself\n\nA surrounding example\n\nAnd various solutions to fix the mistake\n\nSo, in my head, the hardest part was already done.\n\nI haven’t been more wrong in my entire life.\n\nThe next day, I got a reply from someone at Manning with the title of acquisition editor. If you’re not familiar with that role, an acquisition editor is someone who evaluates and signs new book projects for publication. Basically, a scout. Throughout my writing journey, he was my main contact at Manning, and as you will see, he helped me at a critical moment later in the process.\n\nWe had a first meeting to briefly discuss my idea, and Manning was on board to move to the next step: filling out a proposal. This proposal was a document with 21 questions to frame the project, including things like:\n\nSpeaking about yourself\n\nA summary of the book\n\nDescribing your target reader\n\nA table of contents\n\nThis document was then sent by Manning to external reviewers, all with Go experience, who wrote their own evaluations of the proposal. Funny enough, my mate Valentin Deleplace, who would become my colleague a few years later, was actually the first reviewer of the book.\n\nAs a potential author, I had access to all the reviews. And while it’s obviously essential for a publisher to judge the technical quality of a project, it was also super valuable for me. It helped me see whether the idea only sounded good in my own head or if it could actually be interesting to others, too.\n\nI received a total of seven reviews, and all of them were positive. Some included constructive feedback on how to improve certain aspects (like the table of contents, for example), but the overall tone was fully supportive.\n\nIt was December 7, 2020, roughly two weeks after I sent my first email, and I received an offer from Manning:\n\nContract\n\nLet’s talk about one of the aspects people ask about the most: my contract.\n\nIn terms of royalties, I got paid 10% on all sales. On one hand, yes, that’s not a lot. Yet, you really have to understand how helpful a publisher can be for a first-time “author” with zero experience like I was back then, for two main reasons:\n\nFirst, and we will go over the process later, but the number of reviews from different people is insane. If I had written the book completely on my own, I can guarantee the quality would have been way lower.\n\nSecond, in terms of visibility, going with a publisher helps a lot, especially if, like me back then, you had around 400 followers on Twitter. Sure, content can still go viral without a big audience, but it’s a lot less likely.\n\nWhen I signed the contract, I also received an advance: $2,000 upfront, and $2,000 after delivering one-third of the book.\n\nThe contract also included deadlines:\n\nOne-third of the book will be delivered by February 15, 2021\n\nTwo-thirds by April 15, 2021\n\nA full draft of the complete manuscript by July 2021\n\nAs the book was eventually published in August 2022, you can imagine I was slightly late. But when I spoke with people at Manning, they told me most technical books are late. We all know that in tech, we’re not great at planning. So why would it be any different when we start writing books? 🙂\n\nJokes aside, at that stage, I didn’t fully realize how much work was ahead of me, so July 2021 seemed doable.\n\nStarting to Write and Meeting My DE\n\nAt the very beginning, Manning asked me to think deeply about what they call the MQR: Minimum Qualified Reader. In a nutshell, what’s the minimum level of knowledge or experience someone needs to read your book?\n\nThat may sound like a basic question, but at that point, I hadn’t even considered it. Over the next few weeks, I refined my MQR to target someone who already knows the Go language. That meant about 15% of my content could go directly into the nearest trash can as it was just too basic.\n\nAround the same time, I met the person who probably had the biggest impact on the book: my development editor (DE).\n\nA DE helps refine the structure, content, and flow of a manuscript to improve things like clarity, coherence, and how well ideas are conveyed. Note that a DE doesn’t need to be a technical person. Mine had some experience in computer science but absolutely none in Go, and that was perfectly fine. We don’t expect technical reviews from a DE but instead, a valuable contribution to the quality of the writing.\n\nNOTE: This was the person who taught me the key lessons I shared in 10 Rules I Learned About Technical Writing.\n\nI learned a ton from my DE. Like, really, a ton. Before that, I had been writing on various blogs for about a decade, but writing online is all about being direct because most people don’t have time. With a book, it’s different. People made a deliberate decision to buy your book. Now, it’s your job to bring them somewhere valuable. And if that takes time (meaning more words), so be it.\n\nFor example, here’s how I introduced one mistake in The Top 10 Most Common Mistakes I’ve Seen in Go Projects post:\n\n28 words.\n\nAnd here’s how I approached the same mistake in my book:\n\n120 words.\n\nThis isn’t about being verbose just to add pages to increase the book’s price. It’s about making sure the flow works well, that readers know where you’re going, and that they can follow you all the way. There’s a huge gap between writing a blog post and writing a book.\n\nNOTE: In my newsletter, I try not to keep that gap too big. I feel like someone who deliberately shared their email is also making a clear statement: “I’m interested in your content”. I don’t take as much time as I do in the book, but I definitely take more than I did in my older blog posts.\n\nThis is just one example, but my DE helped me massively. I absolutely loved every single bit of his feedback. To be honest, at the beginning of our collaboration, he had a lot of comments. Some things I picked up quickly, but others were much more difficult for me. Yet, over the next months, I will significantly improve my writing.\n\nMindset\n\nI wanted to talk a little bit about my mindset when I started writing the content of my book, chapter after chapter, mistake after mistake.\n\nAt this stage, my mindset was simple: I wanted to write the best Go book. Period.\n\nLet me clarify, though, just to make sure I don’t come across as someone full of ego, as there’s an important nuance here. I wasn’t thinking, “My book is going to be the best.” Instead, I was thinking, “I will give everything I have to bring it to a level where it could be considered the best.”\n\nI already knew at that point that it would probably be my first and last book. So, if I was going to write one, I might as well give everything I had to make sure that what’s going to sit on my shelf for the rest of my life is something I will be proud of.\n\nAlso, having this mindset was a commitment to future readers: you bought my book, I don’t know if you’ll love it, but I promise it’s the best version I could have made.\n\n1P\n\n1P stands for first part. Basically, the process that starts once one-third of the book is written and accepted by the DE (which happened for me after a lot of back and forth to be honest).\n\nFor each third of the book (1P, 2P, and then 3P), the process is similar: the manuscript is sent to external reviewers who can leave comments directly on your text but also fill out a detailed document with questions like:\n\nIs the writing interesting? Does it hold your attention?\n\nAre the examples good and applicable in the real world? Are there enough of them?\n\nWhat do you think of the overall concept of the book and the approach toward the intended audience?\n\nThis document is very thorough. These reviews are invaluable for an author. While you can be confident that the writing itself is fairly solid thanks to the work you were doing with your DE, from a technical standpoint, this is really the first time your content is being confronted by other technical people.\n\nWe got the results for 1P in April 2021. In total, I received 13 reviews, with an average star rating of 4.10 out of 5. Not a fantastic score, but at that point, it was OK. I wasn’t too disappointed.\n\nOf course, some of the feedback you receive as an author can hurt:\n\nBut if it hurts, it probably means there’s some truth behind it. You have to accept it and improve your book.\n\nDuring that period, Manning offered to connect me with another author, Bill Kennedy, who also wrote a book with them called Go in Action. Beyond the fact that I have immense respect for him (he’s one of the people who contributes the most to the Go ecosystem), Bill taught me something crucial:\n\nIf you get one comment, you must address it, even if it doesn’t seem important to you. If one person raised it, imagine when thousands of people read your book.\n\nThat was golden advice. Thanks to Bill, I gave my best to address (almost) every single comment, from changing a single word to fully rewriting how a mistake was explained.\n\nA Technical DE?\n\nIt’s time to talk about my first hiccup with Manning (there will be two).\n\nI already explained how crucial my development editor (DE) was in the process. However, I was also supposed to be accompanied by another person: a technical development editor (TDE).\n\nWhile external reviewers only come in at each third of the book, the TDE is supposed to work more closely with the author throughout the entire process, helping shape the content, the overall structure, how chapters are divided, and so on.\n\nThis isn’t a personal criticism, but my TDE simply wasn’t an MQR. This means he didn’t have the basic Go knowledge expected from someone reading the book. Of course, I wasn’t expecting the world’s top Go expert as a TDE, but I did expect someone who at least matched the Minimum Qualified Reader profile, a concept introduced by Manning themselves. That felt like the bare minimum.\n\nI raised this issue with Manning after 1P, but unfortunately, they didn’t really listen and kept the same TDE on the project. I was a bit annoyed, to be honest, but I had to move on.\n\nMEAP\n\nUntil 1P, the book is in a kind of trial phase, meaning that either Manning or the author can still decide to stop the collaboration. Apparently, a certain percentage of books fail at 1P when Manning realizes that external reviewers aren’t convinced by how the initial idea is being executed.\n\nAfter 1P, Manning launches their Manning Early Access Program (MEAP), which allows people to buy the book and access it while it’s still being written. For the author, it becomes an additional source of feedback, as readers can leave comments on an online platform.\n\nWhen we say people can start buying your book, it also means a shift for Manning: it’s time to sell it.\n\nThat brings a few new responsibilities, like keeping the content regularly updated for those who already paid, writing a welcome letter for MEAP readers, and starting to work with the marketing team on how to promote the book and raise awareness about it.\n\nOn that last point, Manning asked me several times during this period to promote the book at public events (meetups, conferences, etc.), but I always declined. Writing was already taking up so much time and energy that I didn’t feel like adding one more thing to my plate by preparing talks.\n\nThe only “promotion” I did during that time was joining a podcast since it required less preparation. I was invited to Go Time, which was a weekly podcast about Go and the most popular one in the community (unfortunately, it stopped).\n\nThe episode I appeared in, titled sarcastically How to make mistakes in Go, was really well received. That was another interesting signal that talking about mistakes was a compelling angle.\n\nChoosing a Book Cover\n\nDuring that period, it was time to choose a book cover. Manning has a (very) special way of illustrating their books, all based on drawings from Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur, an 18th-century illustrator.\n\nAt first, I received a few illustration options, including this one:\n\nIn a very delicate and constructive manner, I decided to share my opinion:\n\nThe truth is, while I usually enjoy Manning books, I find all their covers pretty bad. Compared to other publishers like No Starch Press, I definitely prefer what others are doing.\n\nI remember having a hard time explaining to my family that my programming book would have this on the cover:\n\nBut hey, it is what it is. I guess it contributes to a certain visual identity for Manning. And in the end, if we take a step back, the cover really isn’t that important… right?\n\n2P\n\nWe’re in August 2021, four months after 1P, and it’s now time for 2P. In retrospect, having only four months to complete the second third of the book was a brutal pace. Looking at some old emails with my DE, it’s clear that this period was particularly exhausting for me:\n\nAnyway, it’s 2P, and this time I received 13 reviews with an average rating of 4.15. So I went from 4.10 to 4.15, and honestly, at that point, I was starting to feel a bit disappointed.\n\nI’m a regular user of Goodreads. On that platform, books are also rated out of 5 stars; in my mind, a “great” book starts at 4.5 and up. Why 4.5? No idea. But that was definitely my goal.\n\n4.15 isn’t bad, but it’s still far from 4.5. So yes, I was disappointed but not dejected. Once again, I went through all the reviews, and I just kept improving the book over and over.\n\nTo give you a sense of what I mean by improving the book “over and over“, keep in mind that between feedback from my DE, external reviewers, and others, there are parts of the book that I rewrote more than ten times. I don’t know if that’s common, to be honest. Maybe it’s because I was terrible at the beginning. Maybe it’s because I’m literally obsessed with details. Or maybe it’s both.\n\n3P\n\nFrom 2P to 3P is almost a blackout for me. This time, the period lasted five months, during which I wrote the last third of the book and completely rewrote the first few chapters. Indeed, once I reached the end of the book, I reread the first part and thought: “This is awful; I can’t publish that.”\n\nThat’s more proof that going through the long, demanding process of writing a book really did improve my writing skills. Some parts that felt fine in the beginning ended up being terrible once I had more experience.\n\nFrom those five months, I only clearly remember one week of \"holiday\" that I spent working on my book. And by week, I don’t mean a peaceful 40-hour work week. I mean waking up at 3 p.m., working 14 to 15 hours straight, and going to bed around 8 a.m.\n\nFunny enough, I didn’t hate that week. In my mind, it was my author week. If I had crossed a stranger on the street and they had asked what I did for a living, I would’ve proudly said: “I’m an author!”\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t speak to anyone that week. Except my janitor.\n\nBut during that week, I made a lot of progress. I managed to write the first draft of the last chapter. I’m sharing this to give you an idea of the pace. The book had 12 chapters, and the one that went the fastest still took me about 100 hours to write. You can imagine how long the rest took. And that’s not even counting the endless rewrites after all the feedback from my DE and the reviewers.\n\nDuring that period, I also worked on my inside cover. I’m a big fan of Designing Data-Intensive Applications by\n\n. His book is full of beautiful visual maps like this one:\n\nI wanted a similar vibe, so I created this:\n\nThe map is full of tiny easter eggs. For example, Kennedy Sea, Cox River, Cheney Ocean, Mount Dogan, or even Deleplace Tower. It was my way of giving a nod to the people in the Go community who helped me the most through their content.\n\nSo, it’s January 2022, and we finally receive the results from 3P.\n\nIn total, I got 15 reviews and an average rating of… 4.6/5. Nice! 😊\n\nAnd speaking of good news, around the same time, Manning finally decided to switch my TDE to someone else, Tim van Deurzen. If you want a simple anecdote to understand Tim’s importance was for this book: during 3P, I received feedback from 15 reviewers. Yet I think Tim’s single review was possibly as valuable as all the others combined. The guy is an absolute rockstar; my book wouldn’t have been the same without him. Thanks again, Tim. 🙇‍♂️\n\nOne more month of work to take all the reviews into account, and…\n\n🥂 Finished!\n\nWe’re at the end of February 2022, and the book officially moves from the development stage to production. At this stage, only a few steps remain, and they are mostly handled by the publisher:\n\nCopyediting to refine grammar, style, and consistency\n\nProofreading to catch spelling, punctuation, and formatting errors\n\nTypesetting to arrange the text, code, and images for publication\n\nIndexing to compile a list of key terms and topics with page references\n\nOne thing to note: from an author’s standpoint, the book is more or less complete at this stage. You can still add minor things, but the publisher wants to lock in a first version. That’s because adding even a single new paragraph means going through the process again for that section. That’s why publishers insist on fixing the version.\n\nReaching that point is a big milestone. To express what I felt at the time, there’s a great quote by Gene Fowler:\n\nA book is never finished; it's abandoned.\n\nReal question: how can you say a book is finished? For example, I could have improved a figure here, tweaked an example there, rephrased a sentence, or refined a conclusion. But that loop could have lasted forever. At some point, you just have to consider this version final, move to the next stage, and, in a way, abandon your book.\n\nIt’s a tough feeling, but that’s how it goes.\n\nThat being said, finishing a book calls for a celebration. I remember having a drink one evening with my girlfriend, and we toasted to “the end of the book.” 🥂\n\nOnce again, I was way too naive.\n\n“ I’ll Stop Everything “\n\nIt’s now time to talk about my second hiccup with Manning, but this time, it was way more serious.\n\nWe started the copyediting process, which is meant to refine grammar, style, and consistency. I don’t know about you, but I imagined the author’s involvement at this stage would be pretty lightweight, right? Absolutely not. At least, not for my book.\n\nFirst, the review process was an exercise in frustration and inefficiency.\n\nDuring the development phase, I wrote everything in AsciiDoc, generated content, and got feedback either as PDF comments from the DE or through the Manning website from reviewers.\n\nBut copyediting was different. The copyeditor was directly editing my content and leaving questions in the source itself.\n\nTo clarify, my content was stored in a Git repository. Instead of going through a classic pull request (PR) workflow, the copyeditor was directly modifying the source files and adding comments on top of that.\n\nFor example, here is my original sentence:\n\nThroughout this section we also used an example with errors because ...\n\nAnd here’s what it looked like after her changes:\n\n// AQ: please clarify leading to this error. Which error? In this section, we used an example with errors because ...\n\nSo she was:\n\nModifying the content directly\n\nAdding comments in the source code itself (🤯)\n\nI tried to explain how review workflows work in a PR-based setup, and gave concrete suggestions for how we could improve the process. But they didn’t want to try it. That might sound like a small thing, but at that stage, all I wanted was a smooth and efficient collaboration process. The easier it was for me to track changes, the better.\n\nBut if that were the only problem, it would have been fine. Unfortunately, it was way more than that.\n\nTo put it simply, my experience with the copyeditor was catastrophic. She completely wrecked the content and introduced countless typos and mistakes.\n\nFor example, many of the issues came from her confusing the programming language Go with the verb to go. That led to many sentences that made absolutely no sense anymore.\n\nLet me be clear: it’s totally fine if a copyeditor introduces a few mistakes. It’s supposed to be a collaborative process: they adapt the content, we go back and forth, and we improve it together.\n\nBut in this case, the number of mistakes was absurd. In just one chapter, she introduced 23 errors. I don’t mean things that could be improved; I mean factual errors. Now multiply that by 12 chapters.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just about errors. When I asked questions like, “Why did you remove this sentence? I think it’s an important transition, and we should keep it”, she would sometimes just delete my comment. Such a great collaboration, right?\n\nEventually, when I raised more and more concerns, what was her response?\n\nShe basically said chapters 1 to 5 were ready to move to the next phase without even letting me fix the mistakes she introduced.\n\nLet me try to put you in my shoes so you understand how I felt.\n\nYou’ve spent 15 months writing your book. You’ve done countless iterations to carefully improve every single one of the 100 mistakes. You’ve spent more hours than you can count. You’ve carefully processed hundreds, if not thousands, of pieces of feedback. You even took dedicated holidays just to make progress on it. And then, all of a sudden, someone jumps into your book, completely butchers it, and says, “These chapters are ready!”\n\nHow would you feel?\n\nWell, that’s exactly how I felt. And to be honest, it was too much for me. I wrote an escalation email (which I won’t share here as it was way too salty) explaining that until this was resolved (meaning she had to leave), I would stop working on my own book.\n\nTo be fair to Manning, the situation was handled fairly quickly. Especially by one person: my acquisition editor (the scout). I really think that he saved the book. Because at that point, I swear that I was ready to give up everything.\n\nIn March 2022, the copyeditor stopped working on my book (she was external to Manning), and I was assigned someone new. That change was a huge relief.\n\nUnfortunately, it meant going through everything again. I had to fix myself every single error she had introduced in the first five chapters, which delayed the book and cost me way more time and energy than I had anticipated.\n\nFinally, at the end of July 2022, after six months of work after I thought the book was \"finished\", we reached the end. And this time, for real.\n\nDid I try to celebrate again with my girlfriend? Yes. What did she reply? “I can’t trust you anymore with your book.”\n\nHappiness?\n\nA few months later, I received a box in the mail. I opened it, and inside were copies of my own book, sent by Manning. As you can imagine, I must have felt a mix of pride and extreme happiness, right? Nope.\n\nI just couldn’t feel anything. I remember holding my own book in my hands and thinking, “What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I just be happy?”\n\nThis feeling isn’t that uncommon and is often referred to as post-publication depression.\n\nIt’s incredibly hard to put words to what I was feeling. It was around August 2022 and I had started working on the content back in July 2019. That’s almost three years of work. It had been such an intense period, and suddenly it was over.\n\nIt wasn’t really sadness. Just… emptiness, I would say.\n\nOver the following months, I slowly started to recover and eventually became very positive about the whole experience. But that moment really changed the way I look at other people’s work.\n\nWhen we evaluate something, a coding project, a book, or an illustration, we often forget how much time, energy, and emotion someone may have poured into it. We have no idea what that work cost them.\n\nPromotion?\n\nSo, the book is released, and everyone can buy it. Time for promotion!\n\nI started with one Reddit post of 175 words, followed by a tweet of 49 words:\n\nIn total, writing these 224 words took me around 10 minutes. And after that? Nothing for more than a year.\n\nThere were two main reasons.\n\nFirst, I was mentally exhausted. Especially after the painful six-month process where I thought my book was finished, but it wasn’t; I just had no energy left. I kept declining Manning’s requests to promote the book at conferences, meetups, YouTube videos, Twitch streams, and so on.\n\nSecond, I developed this belief: if my book was good, people would talk about it and share it. I don’t know if I was being delusional, lucky, or a mix of both, but it turns out I was right. The number of people who kept commenting on the book across Reddit, X, YouTube, and other platforms was absolutely sensational for me.\n\nOne important thing to clarify. This wasn’t about being overconfident or full of ego, like, “Yeah, my content is so good, of course people will talk about it!”\n\nIt was more like, “If my book is worth sharing, people will share it. If not, then should I really bother promoting something people don’t even enjoy?”\n\nOf course, it would’ve broken my heart if people said the content was terrible. But still, that was really my mindset during that year, and honestly, it hasn’t changed much since then.\n\nA year later, in September 2023, with the help of people from the Go community, I released 100go.co, which contains a summary of all the mistakes in the book:\n\nThat website was kind of a way to close the loop on my initial wish to create open-source content. People who can’t or just don’t want to buy the book can still visit 100go.co and access a significant part of the content for free. The traffic ended up being quite strong for such a specialized website: 150k views in 2024.\n\nI discussed 100go.co with Manning, and they said it was a “brilliant idea”. They even offered me a paid role to help other authors promote their content.\n\nIn all honesty, I think they overestimate my sales skills. I haven’t done a lot in that area. For example, last year, I gave a talk at a public conference, and I didn’t even mention that I had written a book. Not because I hate promotion. Well, I do, but that wasn’t the main reason. The real reason was that mentioning my book wouldn’t have improved this talk in any way. So I just didn’t say anything.\n\nWhat about Manning’s offer to help other authors? I didn’t take it.\n\nIf it were up to me, people would still have the option to buy my book physically, but the whole content would be available online for free, with no login required.\n\nI’ve considered talking to Manning about that. We will see if they still believe I have “brilliant” ideas. 😅\n\nTranslations and Total Sales\n\nAt the end of 2022, Manning informed me they had secured licensing deals for four translations. For each of them, I received a fixed payment along with royalties. For example, I earned $4,000 and 6% royalties for the Japanese translation.\n\nAs of the end of September 2024, the English version had sold 10,494 copies .\n\nAs of the end of December 2024, the English version had sold 11,452 copies.\n\nI don’t have the sales figures for the translations, but someone at Manning told me that usually, the combined sales of all translated versions may match the English copies sold.\n\nNOTE: My book also started a new Manning series called 100 … Mistakes and How to Avoid Them, with editions in Java, C++, and SQL Server, for instance.\n\nTo this day, I’ve earned around $47,000 from the book (before taxes). If I consider the time spent, using a conservative lower bound of 2,000 hours, that comes out to about $23 per hour.\n\nThere are two ways to look at that hourly rate.\n\nOne could say it’s pretty low compared to what a software engineer could earn. I could have invested 2,000 hours into some paid technical work and probably made a lot more.\n\nThe other way to approach it is not to care too much about it. Sure, the money I earned isn’t negligible (it paid for quite a few holidays, to be honest), but my main message is this: if you’re a new author, don’t think about writing your book to become rich.\n\nI’m sure there are well-known authors like Robert Martin who can make significant income from pretty much any book they release. But for the rest of us, the “normal” authors, we can’t and shouldn’t aim to get rich, especially from a single book.\n\nFor me, the money I earned from this book was never the goal. I’m happy with it, of course, but that’s not where my main motivation was.\n\nIt was somewhere else.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, did I reach my secret goal of getting a rating over 4.5? Yes, I did!\n\nDid I write the best Go book? Probably not. There are many great books out there and to me, a book like Ultimate Go Notebook is the best one, in my opinion.\n\nBut in the end, do I really care if my book is the best or not? Not really.\n\nThe goal of writing the “best Go book” was just a personal motivation, something to push me to do the best I could at that specific time in my life. The book is not perfect, but it’s the best version I could have written then.\n\nAnd for that, I will always be proud of it.\n\nTeiva\n\nP.S. I don’t know about Go rankings but at least my book was listed among the Best 8 JavaScript Books for Developers in 2024. Being a Go book that’s an achievement, isn’t it?\n\nYes, I still think the cover is ugly.\n\nThanks to:\n\nThe Go community. If I fell in love with this language, it’s also because most people there are very supportive.\n\nAll the readers of the book.\n\nAll the reviewers and Tim, who helped me shape something far better than I could have done on my own.\n\nMy DE and my acquisition editor who were the two pillars of this book.\n\nManning. I don’t know how you will perceive my story, but in the end, I’m really grateful to Manning, and I’m glad they were the only publisher I had ever contacted.\n\nThe readers of The Coder Cafe. After a long period where I couldn’t write anything at all, this newsletter reminded me how much I love writing.\n\n💬 Manning recently contacted me about doing a second edition. I’m thinking about it and would love to hear what you think.\n\n❤️ If you made it this far and enjoyed the post, please consider giving it a like.\n\nExplore Further"}

Up today are benchmarks of the Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 within the ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 up against an assortment of other recent Intel and AMD laptops all while running the near-final state of Ubuntu 25.04.\n\nThe Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 AMD is a 14-inch laptop powered by this 8-core AMD Ryzen Strix Point (Zen 5) SoC while having the build quality we've come to enjoy from the ThinkPad T14 line-up. The Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 21M1001VUS comes equipped with the Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 with integrated Radeon 880M (RDNA 3.5) graphics, 32GB of LPDDR5X-7500 memory soldered, 1TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD, and a 14-inch 1920 x 1200 IPS 400 nit display. The build quality of this Lenovo 21M1001VUS is nice and on-par with other recent ThinkPads. The 14-inch 1200p display though did feel a bit dated for a 2025 laptop with just 400 nits, 60Hz, non-HDR for a high-end business laptop especially if paying anywhere close to the $2,769 USD list price though there are occasional sales on the 21M1001VUS that put it closer to the $1300 mark.\n\nMicrosoft Windows 11 ships on the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 AMD model by default but Lenovo does offer Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Fedora Linux as alternative options. Indeed with Lenovo offering Fedora and Ubuntu pre-loads on this laptop, the Linux support is indeed in good shape. As long as you are on a modern Linux distribution like Fedora 41 or Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (with HWE stack) or newer, you should be in relatively good shape for the ThinkPad T14s G6 and other AMD Strix Point laptops. Particularly with the RDNA 3.5 graphics and for any s2idle/resume quirks or the like, it usually pays off to be on as new of a Linux kernel as possible for the best features/support and performance. With Ubuntu 25.04 shipping the Linux 6.14 kernel (and Fedora 42 also using Linux 6.14), it's a great base point for installations on new laptops if installing yourself.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 is an 8-core / 16-thread laptop processor made up of three Zen 5 cores and five Zen 5C cores. This Strix Point SoC can clock up to 5GHz for the Zen 5 cores or 3.3GHz for the Zen 5C cores. The AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRo 360 has a 16MB L3 cache. The Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 has a default TDP of 28 Watts while there is a configurable TDP from 15 to 54 Watts. As you'll see from some of these benchmarks though with the associated CPU power numbers, the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 running out-of-the-box on Ubuntu 25.04 with the balanced performance ACPI platform profile saw the Ryzen AI 7 360 typically operating in the 15~18 Watt range. Follow-up articles will include looking at the ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 performance when running in the low-power and performance ACPI Platform Profiles for additional context around the performance capabilities of this 8-core Zen 5(C) laptop SoC.\n\nFor this testing all of the laptops were freshly (re)tested on Ubuntu 25.04 using the latest packages as of testing and done on a clean/default OS installation each time. All of the laptops were tested in their out-of-the-box / default state with the balanced performance power profile and similar defaults. Ubuntu 25.04 employs the Linux 6.14 kernel, the GNOME 48 desktop, Mesa 25.0 graphics drivers, GCC 14.2, Python 3.13, and other up-to-date open-source software. The other laptops I had on-hand for this initial round of Ubuntu 25.04 laptop benchmarking included:\n\n- Intel Core i7 1185G7 - Dell XPS 9310\n\n- Intel Core i7 1280P - MSI Prestige 14Evo\n\n- Intel Core Ultra 7 155H - Acer Swift Go 14\n\n- Intel Core Ultra 7 256V - ASUS Zenbook S14\n\n- AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U - ThinkPad T14s G2a\n\n- AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U - ThinkPad X13 G3\n\n- AMD Ryzen 7 7840U - Acer Swift Edge 16\n\n- AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS - Framework 16\n\n- AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 - ThinkPad T14s G6\n\n- AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 - ASUS Zenbook S16\n\n- AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 - ASUS Zenbook S16\n\nFrom there a wide range of 200+ benchmarks were carried out on each laptop for looking at the performance on Ubuntu 25.04. The CPU temperature and CPU package power consumption were also monitored for each benchmark to evaluate the overall power efficiency for these laptops out-of-the-box on clean Ubuntu 25.04 installations."}

But if the crystal structure breaks certain symmetries, a net flow of electrons can arise in one direction. The recipe for creating such photocurrents was thought to require an exotic band structure, the application of a magnetic field, or both. Now Yuichiro Ando of Kyoto University in Japan and his collaborators have observed a photocurrent in films made of single-element, nonmagnetic metals [1].\n\nA photocurrent results from the so-called magnetophotogalvanic effect and requires two symmetries—time reversal and inversion—to be broken. The metallic crystals that Ando and his collaborators examined—copper, platinum, and tungsten—break neither. However, the researchers realized that applying a voltage across the length of the film deflects electrons sideways in a spin-dependent way via the spin Hall effect. The resulting spin-polarized currents that flow along the two edges of the film break time-reversal symmetry (because reversing time would flip the spins) and inversion symmetry (because the current differs on either side of the edge). As a result of this symmetry breaking, when the researchers shined a laser on the films, they detected an additional current—a photocurrent—flowing along the edges.\n\nThe photocurrent is nonlinear in that it depends on the square of the laser’s electric field. Although nonlinear phenomena have been explored extensively in exotic materials and devices, the single-element films studied by Ando and his collaborators are much simpler. Ando anticipates that their discovery will expand the field and challenge preconceived notions.\n\n–Charles Day\n\nCharles Day is a Senior Editor for Physics Magazine."}

The latest scoop by David Ornstein for The Athletic highlights a significant development at Liverpool FC, with star duo Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk on the verge of signing new two-year contracts.\n\nBreakthrough in Negotiations\n\nAfter months of speculation and negotiation, Liverpool fans can finally breathe a sigh of relief. Both Salah and Van Dijk had been edging closer to the ends of their contracts, creating a cloud of uncertainty over their future at the club. However, recent developments suggest a positive outcome is on the horizon. Van Dijk expressed his optimism following a match, stating, “progress” had been made in the discussions. This statement aligns with Liverpool’s recent history of securing their core players under manager Arne Slot, who took over after Jurgen Klopp in May 2024.\n\nImpact on the Squad and Season\n\nThe timing of these potential renewals couldn’t be better. Liverpool are currently leading the Premier League and pushing for the title under Slot’s management. The experience and skill that both Salah and Van Dijk bring to the team are undeniable. Salah, with 243 goals in 394 appearances for Liverpool, continues to be a pivotal figure in their attack. Meanwhile, Van Dijk, who joined the club with a record transfer fee from Southampton, has been instrumental in solidifying Liverpool’s defence.\n\nChallenges and Triumphs\n\nThe road to these extensions hasn’t been without its bumps. Earlier reports indicated that initial offers were not up to the expectations of the players, especially for Van Dijk. Similarly, Salah had voiced his frustrations about the lack of a formal offer last November. Despite these challenges, the persistence of Liverpool’s management, spearheaded by sporting director Richard Hughes, appears to have paid off, demonstrating their commitment to maintaining a competitive squad.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWith these signings, Liverpool not only secures its defensive and offensive linchpins but also sends a strong message to competitors. The leadership qualities of Van Dijk and the relentless scoring ability of Salah are set to bolster Liverpool’s aspirations not just in the Premier League, but in European competitions as well.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThe news of Salah and Van Dijk nearing their contract renewals is nothing short of thrilling. These aren’t just any players; they are the heart and soul of our club. Salah, our Egyptian King, has dazzled us with his magic on the pitch time and again. His knack for scoring crucial goals has turned many a tight game in our favour. On the other hand, Van Dijk is our rock at the back. His calmness under pressure and leadership have been key factors in our defensive resilience.\n\nThis development isn’t just about securing two players; it’s about making a statement. In the wake of Klopp’s departure and under Slot’s new regime, there were fears about Liverpool’s ability to remain at the pinnacle of English football. However, these contract extensions are a clear indicator of our ambitions and our commitment to continue fighting for every title.\n\nThe thought of Salah and Van Dijk wearing the red shirt for another two years is exhilarating. They are not just players; they are legends who inspire the team and the fanbase alike. Their continued presence ensures that the team remains a formidable force in all competitions, driving us towards more glory. Here’s to hoping the ink dries soon on those contracts, and we can celebrate keeping our heroes at Anfield where they belong!"}

The Middle-Eastern clubs were ready to make him one of the richest players globally, with a proposed salary of €150 million per year, tax-free. Despite the eye-watering figures, Salah’s decision was driven by much more than money.\n\n“The message was always clear: ‘I want to stay,’” noted Fabrizio Romano. This statement highlights Salah’s deep-rooted commitment to the club and its ambitions, further evidenced by his willingness to take a financial compromise to secure a two-year extension with Liverpool.\n\nVan Dijk’s Renewal and Alexander-Arnold’s Exit\n\nAmid the backdrop of Salah’s dramatic saga, Liverpool have also secured Virgil van Dijk’s future while bracing for Trent Alexander-Arnold’s probable move to Real Madrid. Van Dijk, at 33, remains a pivotal figure in Liverpool’s defence, boasting 13 clean sheets this season alone. His contract extension through 2027 signals stability and continued leadership, crucial for Arne Slot’s evolving team dynamics.\n\nImplications of Salah’s Decision for Liverpool\n\nSalah’s extension is a powerful narrative about the magnetic allure of legacy over lucre. By staying at Liverpool, Salah not only affirms his loyalty but also reinforces the club’s attractiveness to elite talent, resisting the burgeoning financial clout of Saudi-backed clubs.\n\n“Salah could have earned an annual salary of around €150 million in Saudi Arabia. But it was never about the money — it was about legacy, continuing to break records, and his deep desire to win the Ballon d’Or,” Mahmoud emphasised. Salah’s focus on accolades over income splendidly illustrates the ethos of top-tier players devoted to their careers’ qualitative aspects.\n\nOne more thing.. Salah could have earned an annual salary of around €150 million in Saudi Arabia. But it was never about the money — it was about legacy, continuing to break records, and his deep desire to win the Ballon d’Or. https://t.co/KUEbnC6GkA — Ismael Mahmoud – إسماعيل محمود (@ismaeelmahmoudd) April 9, 2025\n\nStrategic Moves in Liverpool’s Future\n\nThe resolution of Salah and Van Dijk’s contracts minimises the potential upheaval from Alexander-Arnold’s departure. While the loss of a homegrown talent like Alexander-Arnold is poignant, securing the tenures of other key players like Salah ensures the club remains on a firm footing. Such moves are integral for Liverpool as they navigate through transitions and aim for their 20th Premier League title.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs a Liverpool fan, one can’t help but swell with pride over Mohamed Salah’s decision to stay at Anfield. Rejecting a colossal offer from Saudi Arabia not only cements his status as a Liverpool legend but also demonstrates his profound connection with the club and the city. This isn’t just about football; it’s about choosing a legacy that will resonate far beyond his playing days.\n\nSalah’s choice sends a resounding message across the football world – that Anfield remains a bastion for those who value glory and history over momentary gains. As Liverpool fans, we see this as an affirmation of the club’s ethos and its magnetic appeal, which even the richest clubs can’t match.

Maybe you were looking for an image similar to one you had, or trying to find an article that captured the essence of a topic, but the search engine just didn’t get it. This disconnect happens because traditional databases, while great at handling structured data like spreadsheets or inventory lists, struggle to understand the deeper meaning behind unstructured data like images, audio, or freeform text. It’s like speaking two different languages—one rooted in rigid structure, the other in rich, nuanced context. But what if there was a way to bridge this gap and make computers “understand” data more like humans do?\n\nEnter vector databases, a new solution designed to handle unstructured data in a way that feels intuitive and context-aware. By representing data as mathematical embeddings—essentially capturing its essence in a multi-dimensional space—vector databases allow for smarter, more meaningful searches. Whether it’s powering AI-driven chatbots, allowing precise product recommendations, or helping you find that perfect image, these databases are transforming how we interact with data. In this guide, the IBM Technology team explore how vector databases work, why they’re so innovative, and the exciting ways they’re shaping the future of AI and data management.\n\nWhat is a Vector Database?\n\nA vector database is a specialized system designed to store and retrieve unstructured data—such as images, text, and audio—by converting it into mathematical representations known as vector embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of data, allowing advanced similarity searches and bridging the “semantic gap” between how computers process information and how humans interpret it.\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Vector databases store and retrieve unstructured data (e.g., images, text, audio) using vector embeddings, allowing semantic search and bridging the “semantic gap” between human and machine understanding.\n\nTraditional relational databases struggle with unstructured data, while vector databases use embeddings to interpret and retrieve data contextually and intuitively.\n\nVector embeddings represent data in multi-dimensional space, with specialized models like CLIP, GloVe, and Wav2Vec generating embeddings for images, text, and audio, respectively.\n\nKey applications of vector databases include semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for AI systems, and similarity search for recommendations and anomaly detection.\n\nVector databases use high-dimensional indexing techniques like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms to ensure fast and efficient retrieval, making them essential for AI-driven environments.\n\nThe Challenge of the Semantic Gap in Traditional Databases\n\nTraditional relational databases excel at managing structured data, such as rows and columns, but they struggle with unstructured data. For example, while a relational database can efficiently retrieve records based on exact matches or predefined attributes (e.g., “find all entries where color = orange”), it cannot interpret contextual relationships or nuanced similarities. This limitation creates a “semantic gap,” where the database fails to align with human thought processes in understanding or retrieving information.\n\nUnstructured data, such as an image of an orange or a sentence describing its flavor, requires a more sophisticated approach to capture its meaning. Vector databases address this challenge by using vector embeddings to bridge the gap, allowing context-aware and intuitive data retrieval. This capability is particularly valuable in AI-driven applications, where understanding the context and relationships within data is critical.\n\nVector Embeddings: The Backbone of Semantic Understanding\n\nVector embeddings are mathematical representations of data in a multi-dimensional space. These embeddings are essentially arrays of numbers, where similar items are positioned closer together, and dissimilar items are farther apart. For instance, the embedding of a cat image will be closer to that of a dog image than to a car image, reflecting their semantic similarity.\n\nSpecialized models generate these embeddings, each tailored to specific types of data:\n\nCLIP: Aligns visual and textual semantics by creating embeddings for both images and text, allowing cross-modal understanding.\n\nAligns visual and textual semantics by creating embeddings for both images and text, allowing cross-modal understanding. GloVe: Focuses on text embeddings, capturing word relationships and contextual meaning for natural language processing tasks.\n\nFocuses on text embeddings, capturing word relationships and contextual meaning for natural language processing tasks. Wav2Vec: Processes audio data to generate embeddings that represent sound features, facilitating tasks like speech recognition and audio classification.\n\nThese embeddings form the foundation of vector databases, allowing them to perform similarity searches and contextual data retrieval. This capability is crucial for AI applications that require a deep understanding of unstructured data.\n\nPowering Semantic Search & AI Applications\n\nHere are more detailed guides and articles that you may find helpful on vector databases.\n\nKey Applications of Vector Databases\n\nVector databases are transforming how unstructured data is managed and used across various industries. Their ability to handle complex, context-rich data has led to several impactful applications:\n\nSemantic Search: By comparing vector embeddings, these databases retrieve content that is contextually similar. For example, they can identify articles related to a specific topic, locate images with similar features, or find audio clips with comparable sound patterns.\n\nBy comparing vector embeddings, these databases retrieve content that is contextually similar.

IVF (Inverted File Index): A partitioning method that organizes embeddings into clusters, allowing faster searches within specific regions of the data space.\n\nThese algorithms ensure that even massive datasets can be searched quickly without compromising relevance. For example, an image-sharing platform can use ANN methods to recommend visually similar photos to users within milliseconds, even when dealing with millions of images. This combination of speed and accuracy is a key advantage of vector databases.\n\nAdvantages of Vector Databases Over Traditional Systems\n\nVector databases offer several distinct advantages over traditional relational databases, particularly when it comes to managing unstructured data:\n\nSemantic Search: Unlike keyword-based searches, vector databases understand the context and meaning behind queries, delivering more accurate and relevant results.\n\nUnlike keyword-based searches, vector databases understand the context and meaning behind queries, delivering more accurate and relevant results.

This introduction to the magical forest character fills us with as much warmth as it does Mei, and leaves us wondering what it might be like to lay upon the character’s round belly ourselves.\n\nLuckily for us, that dream is now well within reach, thanks to the My Neighbour Totoro Nap Cushion. Produced by Ghibli’s specialty retail chain, Donguri Kyowakoku, this cushion was initially released a couple of years ago but sold out due to popularity.\n\nNow the cushion is finally back in stock, and ready for you to lay your head upon its approximately 70-centimetre (27.6-inch) long body.\n\nIt’s easy to see what made the cushion a sell-out hit, with so many cute details bringing Totoro to life in an adorably sleepy way. The character’s fluffy ears and tail are beautifully replicated, along with the whiskers and talons, but it’s that rotund belly and those sleepy eyes that will have us dozing off in no time.\n\nCuddling up to Totoro does come at a price, though, as the cushion costs 27,500 yen (US$186,59). For diehard fans, the splurge will be worth it, and it’s considerably cheaper than this three-foot tall Totoro, which will set you back 110,000 yen.\n\nSource: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\nFeatured image: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\nInsert images: Studio Ghibli (1, 2), Donguri Kyowakoku\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

While gratin generally contains a bed of pasta or potatoes, covered in a cheesy bechamel sauce and baked until browned, this looks like…well, quiche and a side of cream.\n\nPutting our prejudices aside, we decided to give this hack a chance, and when we tasted the weird combination, we were pleasantly surprised. Rather than being sweet, the cream was milky, melting into the warmth of the quiche in a way that butter might, creating a mouthfeel that wasn’t dissimilar to bechamel sauce.\n\nIt added a creamy richness to the cheesy quiche, highlighting the saltiness of the bacon and making it even more decadent and delicious. It was like a taste revelation, and now we’ve unlocked its secrets, we highly recommend jumping on board with the viral trend and trying it for yourself.\n\nWhipped cream can be added to any item on the food menu for 33 yen (US$0.23) so this opens up a whole world of new flavour possibilities. Let us know if you come up with any weird and wonderful combinations so we can try them!\n\nSource, images: Press release\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

This price is based on data from reliable sources like Coinbase and CoinGecko, showing consistency around this value as of today.\n\nRecent News\n\nRecent news highlights that Bitcoin has sunk back below $80,000, with markets shifting focus to a potential conflict with China, contributing to today’s price movement. This aligns with reports of increased volatility due to geopolitical tensions.\n\nMarket Context\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is sensitive to global economic news, and today’s developments underscore the impact of international relations on Bitcoin’s price, particularly U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\nSurvey Note: Detailed Analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) on April 10, 2025\n\nThis section provides a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) on April 10, 2025, focusing on its current price, recent news, and market context, ensuring a thorough understanding for readers interested in cryptocurrency dynamics. The analysis is based on recent web searches, direct website browsing, and social media discussions, aligning with the current time of 03:31 PM PDT on April 10, 2025.\n\nBackground on Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, launched in 2009 by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency, operating on a blockchain technology that allows peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. Its price is highly volatile, influenced by market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and geopolitical events. On April 10, 2025, the focus is on understanding Bitcoin’s current state, given its global significance and sensitivity to international relations.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe analysis is based on recent web searches for “current Bitcoin price” and “CoinDesk Bitcoin sinks below 80k,” supplemented by browsing specific pages on Coinbase and CoinGecko for price verification, and X searches for “Bitcoin and China conflict” and “current Bitcoin price” to gauge market sentiment. The focus is on content from April 7 to April 10, 2025, to capture the most current information. Sources include reputable cryptocurrency news platforms like CoinDesk, financial data providers like Coinbase and CoinGecko, and social media discussions on X.\n\nCurrent Price Analysis\n\nThe current price of Bitcoin is determined through multiple sources, with recent data showing consistency around $79,850. Specifically:\n\nBrowsing Coinbase on April 10, 2025, showed a price of $79,825.70, with a 24-hour trading volume of $47,328,668,923.28 and a -3.86% change over the past 24 hours.\n\nBrowsing CoinGecko on April 10, 2025, showed a price of $79,878.33, with a 24-hour trading volume of $47,230,103,711 and a -4.20% change over the past 24 hours.\n\nThese prices, both below $80,000, align with the current time and suggest a recent drop from earlier in the week. For instance, web searches from April 9, 2025, showed prices around $81,586 on Coinbase and CoinMarketCap, indicating a decline of approximately $1,700 in the past day. X posts also provided context, with @muhammadrazah on April 7, 2025, mentioning a price of $76,556.01, and @AskPerplexity on the same day noting $78,710, suggesting volatility leading up to today.\n\nTo organize this, here is a table summarizing the price data:\n\nSource Date and Time (PDT) Price (USD) 24-Hour Change Notes Coinbase April 10, 2025, (Recent) 79,825.70 -3.86% High trading volume, detailed market stats CoinGecko April 10, 2025, (Recent) 79,878.33 -4.20% Includes 7d range, all-time high/low Web Search (Coinbase) April 9, 2025, 15:27 81,586.01 +6.31% Outdated, shows earlier recovery X Post (@muhammadrazah) April 7, 2025, 06:48 76,556.01 -7.17% Reflects earlier drop, tariff impact X Post (@AskPerplexity) April 7, 2025, 07:50 78,710 +0.47% Mentions bearish trends, support levels\n\nGiven the consistency between Coinbase and CoinGecko at around $79,850, and considering the current time, the price is approximated at $79,850 for simplicity, acknowledging the slight variation.\n\nRecent News and Market Context\n\nThe top news today, as reported by CoinDesk on April 10, 2025, at 09:14 PDT, is “Why is Bitcoin Price (BTC) Lower on Thursday?”, with the article stating, “Bitcoin (BTC), which rose more than 8% the day prior, dipped about 4% below $80,000 again on Thursday. The decline in bitcoin came alongside a renewed plunge in the Nasdaq, which was lower by 5.5% following yesterday’s 12% rally as traders are assessing U.S. President Donald Trump’s next steps in his tariff policy” (CoinDesk). This aligns with web searches showing Bitcoin sinking below $80,000 due to potential China conflict, particularly tariff escalations.\n\nX searches for “Bitcoin and China conflict” provided additional context, with @BTCTN on April 7, 2025, at 08:31 PDT, posting, “Bitcoin and stocks tanked as U.S.-China tensions hit a boiling point 🌍📉 QCP Capital warns of an approaching ‘full-scale economic war.’ – $800M in BTC and ETH derivatives liquidated in 24 hours – China’s market sees worst crash since 2008 – Bitcoin volatility spiked to” (@BTCTN). This post, though from April 7, supports the narrative of U.S.-China tensions impacting Bitcoin, with recent articles confirming continued volatility.\n\nThe news underscores Bitcoin’s sensitivity to geopolitical risks, with historical data showing it often acts as a hedge during trade wars. The recovery to around $79,850 suggests market resilience, possibly driven by institutional buying or positive sentiment later in the day, but the focus remains on tariff-related uncertainties.\n\nBroader Context and Implications\n\nBitcoin’s price movement today reflects broader market dynamics, with U.S.-China tensions contributing to a sell-off. The cryptocurrency market operates 24/7, and today’s developments highlight the need for investors to stay informed about global economic news. For instance, Coinbase’s market stats show an all-time high of $109,026.02, currently 26.78% below, indicating significant volatility over time. CoinGecko’s data includes a 7-day range of $74,773.26 to $84,613.65, further illustrating recent fluctuations.\n\nX posts also provided insights into market sentiment, with @agentic_t on April 4, 2025, at 00:55 PDT, mentioning a price of $83,627 and a fear/greed index showing fear at 25, suggesting bearish sentiment earlier in the week (@agentic_t). This aligns with the observed price drop, reinforcing the impact of news cycles on market behavior.\n\nLimitations and Future Considerations\n\nThe analysis faced challenges in resolving exact publication times for some articles and accessing full content for specific CoinDesk articles. Future analyses could benefit from real-time price feeds and deeper social media sentiment analysis to capture rapid market shifts. Additionally, the focus on English-language sources may miss regional perspectives, particularly from Chinese media, which could provide further insights into the conflict’s impact.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn April 10, 2025, Bitcoin’s current price is approximately $79,850, reflecting recent volatility and a drop below $80,000 due to markets shifting focus to potential U.S.-China conflict. This aligns with news reports and social media discussions, emphasizing the cryptocurrency’s sensitivity to geopolitical tensions and the importance of staying informed about global economic developments.\n\nKey Citations"}

We discover more about who we are and the way life is, and then we realize there are some changes we need to make. The lifestyle we’ve been living no longer fits. The environments and relationships we once found comfort in no longer exist, or no longer serve our best interests. So we cherish all the great memories, but find ourselves at a crossroads in life, moving forward.\n\nAnd it’s not easy. It’s painful to give up what’s comfortable and familiar, especially when there’s no other choice. My husband (Marc) and I have struggled through this process many times out of necessity. Over the past 15 years we’ve had to deal with several significant, unexpected life changes and challenges, including:\n\nLosing a sibling to death in our mid-20’s\n\nLosing a best friend to a freak accident two weeks later\n\nFinancial unrest following a breadwinning employment layoff\n\nBreaking ties with a loved one who repeatedly betrayed us\n\nFamily business failure (and reinvention)\n\nand the list goes on…\n\nThose experiences were brutal. Each of them, naturally, knocked us down and off course for a period of time. But once we accepted the truth, by giving up our ideals and letting go of the way things used to be, we pressed forward, more resilient, and with a greater understanding and respect for life.\n\nGetting to the right state of mind, one that actually allowed us to move forward with our lives, required mindful practice. Because when we were initially faced with each one of those brutal experiences — when we were standing at the forefront of another rocky crossroads in our lives — you better believe our minds were spinning with emotions. We had to learn to catch ourselves in that whirlwind of emotional turmoil and calm our minds, so we could cope effectively and move forward.\n\nWhen you find yourself facing a disheartening reality your emotional reaction might be to deny the situation, or to avoid dealing with it altogether. But by doing so you’re inadvertently holding on even tighter to the pain that you wish to let go of — you’re, in effect, sealing it up inside you. If you notice yourself doing something similar, it’s time to pause, admit to yourself that you’re coping by avoiding, and then shift your focus to a healthier coping mechanism, like using the quotes listed later in this post to help you open your mind.\n\nWhen you face struggles with an attitude of openness — open to the painful feelings and emotions you have — you find out that it’s not comfortable, but you can still be fine and you can still step forward. Openness means you don’t instantly decide that you know this is only going to be a horrible experience — it means you admit that you don’t really know what the next step will be like, and you’d like to understand the whole truth of the matter. It’s a calm learning stance, instead of one that franticly assumes the worst.\n\nThe Benefits of Healthy Coping\n\nCoping in a healthy way isn’t always an easy thing to do, but it’s always worth your while. With practice, healthy coping allows you to find better ways of managing life’s continuous stream of unexpected and uncontrollable circumstances. For example…\n\nA task is harder than you expected it to be — Instead of running from a daunting and overwhelming task, you can accept it and see what it’s like to feel uncomfortable and overwhelmed, and still take action anyway. Writing a book, for example, is daunting and overwhelming, but you can still write one even with those feelings rolling through you (just like Marc and I did with our books).\n\nAn interaction with someone you love angers or frustrates you — Instead of lashing out at a loved one when you’re upset with them, you can sit quietly with your difficult feelings and just be open to what it’s like to feel them. And then, once you’ve had a moment to breathe, you can see what it’s like to deal compassionately with someone you love who you’re also upset with. To try to understand them instead of just judging them at their worst.\n\nUnhealthy cravings overwhelm you out of nowhere — You may be inclined to indulge in unhealthy cravings like alcohol and sweets for comfort when you’re feeling stressed out. But you can sit with these feelings and be open to them instead, and then gradually build positive daily rituals for coping in healthier ways—taking walks, meditating, talking with someone about your feelings, journaling, reviewing the relevant quotes from our book provided in this post, etc.\n\nYou are forced to deal with a loved one’s death — When someone you love passes away, the grief and sense of loss can seem overwhelming. And at that point, it’s incredibly easy to give in to unhealthy, “quick-fix” ways of alleviating the pain. But you have to force yourself to do the opposite—to give yourself compassion, to sit with the powerfully difficult thoughts and feelings you have, and to open your mind to what lies ahead. Gradually it becomes evident that death isn’t just an ending, but also a beginning. Because while you have lost someone special, this ending, like all losses, is a moment of reinvention. Although deeply sad, their passing forces you to reinvent your life, and in this reinvention is an opportunity to experience beauty in new, unseen ways and places.\n\nAnd of course, we’ve merely just scratched the surface of an endless pool of possibilities for healthy coping. The key thing to understand is that by learning to cope in healthier ways, you will find that you can better handle anything life throws your way, and come out stronger, calmer, and sometimes even happier than you were before.\n\nThe simplest way of getting started?\n\nDaily Reminders for Inner Calmness and Healthy Coping\n\nIt’s all about keeping the right thoughts at the top of your mind every day, so they’re readily available on those inevitable days when you need them most. For Marc and me, that means sitting down quietly with ourselves every morning and reflecting on precisely what we needed to remember. We use quotes like the ones below to do just that (several of which are excerpts from our books).\n\nSome people call them affirmations, or mantras, or prayers, or convictions, but in any case these daily reminders keep us on track by keeping calm, peaceful, productive thoughts and perspectives at the top of our minds, even when life gets utterly chaotic. And over the years we’ve ultimately learned that peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hard realities to deal with — peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still remain calm in your mind and centered in your heart.\n\nChallenge yourself to choose one of these quotes every morning or evening, and then sit for a minute or two while repeating it silently in your mind. See how doing so gradually changes the way you think through life’s twists, turns, and crossroads:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\n12.\n\n13.\n\n14.\n\n15.\n\n16.\n\n17.\n\n18.\n\n19.\n\n20.\n\n21.\n\n22.\n\n23.\n\n24.\n\n25.\n\n26.\n\n27.\n\n28.\n\n29.\n\n30.\n\n31.\n\n32.\n\n33.\n\n34.\n\n35.\n\n36.\n\n37.\n\n38.\n\n39.\n\n40.\n\nBefore you go, please share this post with others who you think will benefit from it, and also share your thoughts with us in the comments section below.

Among the four rumored models—Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the foldable Pixel 10 Pro Fold—the foldable device has garnered the most attention. The video below explores the key aspects of the Pixel 10 series, focusing on pricing strategies, advancements in foldable technology, and performance improvements that could shape the future of smartphones.\n\nPixel 10 Series: What You Need to Know\n\nBuilding on the success of the Pixel 9 series, which earned praise for its balance of performance and affordability, the Pixel 10 lineup is expected to refine and expand on these strengths. The base Pixel 10 is rumored to start at $799, maintaining an accessible price point for consumers seeking a high-quality smartphone. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro XL may see a slight price increase, potentially reaching $1,200, reflecting its premium features and larger display.\n\nThe standout model, however, is the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. This foldable device represents Google’s latest foray into innovative smartphone technology. With a rumored launch price of $1,600, it positions itself as a more affordable alternative to competitors like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, which typically starts at higher price points. By offering a foldable device at a relatively competitive price, Google aims to attract both tech enthusiasts and mainstream users.\n\nFoldable Display Technology: Innovation Meets Accessibility\n\nFoldable smartphones are no longer a niche concept—they are becoming a prominent trend in the tech industry. However, their high price tags have often limited their appeal to a select group of consumers. Google’s Pixel 10 Pro Fold seeks to address this challenge by offering a foldable device at a price point that undercuts many competitors. At $1,600, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is still a premium product, but it represents a step toward making foldable technology more accessible.\n\nLooking ahead, Google may explore ways to further reduce production costs. By incorporating more affordable components or optimizing manufacturing processes, the company could potentially lower the price of its foldable devices to $1,500 or less by 2028. This strategy aligns with Google’s broader goal of increasing the adoption of foldable smartphones and making advanced technology available to a wider audience. If successful, this approach could help foldable devices transition from a luxury product to a mainstream option.\n\nPerformance Enhancements: Thermal Management and Connectivity\n\nThe Pixel 9 series set a high standard for performance, particularly in areas like thermal management and connectivity, and the Pixel 10 series is expected to build on these advancements. Effective thermal management is crucial for maintaining device performance during demanding tasks such as gaming, video editing, or multitasking. By keeping devices cool, Google ensures a smoother user experience and longer-lasting hardware reliability.\n\nConnectivity is another area where the Pixel 10 series is likely to shine.

This shift could ultimately benefit consumers, making advanced technology more accessible and driving competition in the market.\n\nShaping the Future of Smartphones\n\nThe Pixel 10 series represents a significant step forward for Google, particularly with the introduction of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. By focusing on affordability, innovative performance, and innovative design, Google is working to make foldable smartphones a viable option for a broader audience. The combination of competitive pricing and advanced features positions the Pixel 10 series as a potentially fantastic option in the smartphone industry.\n\nAs the October launch approaches, the Pixel 10 lineup is generating excitement among tech enthusiasts and casual users alike.
