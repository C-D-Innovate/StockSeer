We're watching Magnificent 7 stocks, Airlines, and Pharmaceuticals. First up, let's talk about that Magnificent 7 rallying after the US and China agreed to tariff reductions. The stocks are up nearly 20% from their April 8th low here. And there you're taking a look at Nvidia, Apple, and Tesla on your screen. Um, and then perhaps we can take a look at the rest of them as well here. Amazon, of course, was one that we did see ripping to the upside here pre-market. And here's kind of a piece of the negotiation and the deals that we are still waiting more details around and still will need to be negotiated out in full. But if you're looking back and trying to use the 2020 deal as a measuring post, there could potentially for these tech companies be major advances at least in intellectual property protections here, which as you think about how many of them are trying to either make sure that their products continue to remain available in China or the Asia Pacific region more broadly and what intellectual property protections they would like if they are putting products in that region, whether it be chips, whether it be smartphones, they all want to make sure that there's a crackdown on counterfeit goods, that there's improved protection for trade secrets, and then uh measurements against some of these forced technology transfers. And so if you were able to insulate that and offer them some of those protections, that could potentially be a boon on top of, yeah, Apple not having to, you know, charge US consumers as much because they would be hitting or hit with more tariffs to get their products from production in China into the US and vice versa.\n\n03:09 Speaker B\n\nYeah, it's interesting off the back of Apple this morning soaring not only because it's going up alongside the rest of the market, but also because of that announcement on potential increased uh prices that is, according to the Wall Street Journal this morning, citing sources that Apple could be lifting iPhone prices, not tying it to tariffs though because they don't want to have that headline cross, but they're lifting prices uh because of tariff policy here. But interesting to see the entire basket moving up. Nvidia in particular interesting because we didn't get any headlines specific to export controls on chips specifically, but yet it's moving up alongside the broader basket, the mag 7s, currently on track to be in a bull market if it continues to move to the upside.\n\n04:08 Speaker A\n\nOnly other thing I'll say here on the mag 7, Amazon perhaps could have been one of the biggest like WTF moments that happened for the White House to have to consider as part of the broader trade negotiations when it leaked out some action that eventually was refuted by Amazon in saying that or there was a report that said that they were going to list what the increase in prices was due to tariffs and the White House got pissed off by that. And so that could have been one of the other major moments in this broader kind of timeline that we've continued to track here. And ultimately, uh, interesting to see how Amazon, of course, a platform that really relies on some of those cheaper products being able to make their way into the e-commerce platform as well here.\n\n05:32 Speaker B\n\nAbsolutely. Well, next up, let's look at Airlines, one of the biggest gainers this morning following the agreement between the US and China to temporarily lower tariffs, also coming after the US government announced plans to spend tens of billions of dollars to upgrade the nation's air traffic control system. Look at all these stocks moving up across the board. The interesting thing, Kevin Gordon from Charles Schwab pointed this out, he'll be on with us later, are services going to be a area where consumers still feel that they can spend going forward even if you kind of try to put the toothpaste back in the tube when it comes to tariffs.\n\n06:20 Speaker A\n\nThis one's difficult because you think about the summer travel season and how many consumers are still trying to figure out how much they have the propensity to spend versus recent years. We've come out of the years of the revenge travel, even the bleisure travel demand. And so now you're looking at a consumer that is being extremely discretionary about some of the travel and experience economy that they buy into, whether that be in parks and resorts. And of course, Disney, they were able to actually come out and signal a little bit more of a brighter light on that in terms of some of the investments that they're making going forward. Um, but for all the airlines, they have been up in the air about what the guidance and the near term, I'm sorry, I had to do it. They have been up in the air about exactly how they can communicate to the street where there's confidence in their guidance versus where they just need to level set and bring down expectations in order for them to beat on some of those lower bars as well.\n\n07:50 Speaker B\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n07:53 Speaker A\n\nFinally here, let's talk a little pharma stocks following as President Trump vows to cut drug prices by more than 50%. Trump says he will institute a policy known as most favored nation where the US government plans to pay prices for drugs that are tied to the prices paid by other countries. You're seeing shares of some of the largest uh healthcare stocks here moving to the downside actually right now. What this would essentially mean is that they're not going to be able to extract as much in some of those margins or charge higher prices that then buoy those margins as well.\n\n08:44 Speaker B\n\nAbsolutely. And there's obviously criticism about the US pharma companies being able to do a lot of the R&D that allows for uh some of that drug development to be a lift to these stocks. And in part, that's something the president will be addressing. He'll be speaking coming up here at 9:30 a.m. Eastern. We may have more headlines on those pharmaceutical stocks coming out of those remarks."}

The EV maker has faced a political backlash over CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts, with shares erasing much of their gains in the wake of President Donald Trump's election win. Last month, Musk said he would step back from Trump's Department of Government Efficiency to spend more time with Tesla.\n\nSales have lagged, including in China, where the company shipped fewer vehicles in April than it did a year earlier. Last month marked Tesla's seventh straight month of year-over-year declines in shipments from China, according to preliminary data from the China Passenger Car Association.\n\n"}

The 90-… [+5718 chars]", "title": "Jim Cramer sees 4 stocks as our biggest winners of easing U.S.-China trade tensions", "fullContent": "The United States and China agreed on Monday to temporarily halt the majority of tariffs on each other's goods — a development that bodes, particularly, well for the future of four Club stocks. The 90-day pause, which takes effect Wednesday, reduces \"reciprocal\" levies from 125% to 10%. However, the effective rate on China will be 30% because the U.S.-imposed tariff of 20% for fentanyl trafficking will remain. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Monday that he expects the two sides to continue talks in the coming weeks. The breakthrough follows a series of aggressive trade measures initiated by President Donald Trump that jolted financial markets and escalated recession fears. The White House previously announced tariffs up to 145% on Chinese imports, causing Beijing to retaliate. Monday's trade announcement signals an easing of geopolitical tensions between the world's two largest economies. Jim outlined four stocks in the Club's 29-name portfolio that will benefit the most. AVGO YTD mountain Broadcom (AVGO) year-to-date performance At the top of the list is Broadcom. The stock, which soared more than 5.5% on Monday, has had a volatile year. Shares are down nearly 6% in 2025 versus the S & P 500' s less than 1% decline over the same period. Tariffs have spooked investors because they threaten the company's substantial China business, which accounted for 20% of its overall revenue last year. Concerns about cooling artificial intelligence spending have dampened sentiment around Broadcom's custom chip business, too. Jim described Broadcom as \"the biggest winner\" of reduced tensions between the U.S. and China. He believes it \"can continue to go higher.\" During Monday's Morning Meeting , Jim added, \"That stock is coming all the way back. I know at $180 and $170 it was really, really touch and go, but now it's nicely over $200.\" NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia (NVDA) year-to-date performance The second is Nvidia. Shares were up nearly 5% on Monday's news. \"I think it's breaking out,\" Jim said. \"A lot of people who were in Nvidia got out of Nvidia, and the people who are left are real hardcore Nvidians. I like that.\" In April, Jim retired his long-held \"own, don't trade\" stance on Nvidia due to Trump's aggressive moves, which included a new licensing requirement for its dumbed-down China-specific H20 chip that resulted in a $5.5 billion inventory charge. That prompted us to sell some shares. Better relations with China would improve Nvidia sentiment because China remains a huge market for the chipmaker, which has become an even tougher to serve during the trade feud. AMZN YTD mountain Amazon.com (AMZN) year-to-date performance Then, there's Amazon. The stock rose nearly 8% on Monday. The e-commerce and cloud giant will be able to grab more retailer share from Chinese discounters like Temu and Shein following recent tariff developments. On Friday, the Trump administration ended de minimis exemptions on Chinese goods, which had given U.S. duty free access for low-value shipments that are often exploited by these e-commerce firms. With that loophole gone, and no mention in Monday's trade deal, Temu and Shein customers may turn to Amazon's Haul store instead. That's the company's ultra-low-cost retail platform that sells home goods, apparel, and other products for $20 or less. In turn, Jim described Amazon as being in a \"good situation\" right now. AAPL YTD mountain Apple (AAPL) year-to-date perfomance Finally, there's Apple. Shares jumped 6% on Monday. The tech behemoth benefits from better relations with China because of its huge exposure there. Not only is China Apple's second-largest market by sales, but also the majority of its products are manufactured there. Higher levies and a shift in production in other countries could force Apple to raise the prices on its devices, potentially hurting demand. However, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is still weighing price increases for its fall iPhone lineup. Apple's China woes were a key reason why we removed our \"own, don't trade\" label on the stock, along with Nvidia, last month. The Club also sold some shares as a result. \"We did our trimming of Apple and Nvidia,\" Jim added. \"We don't need to do any more trimming.\" Additionally, Jim said Apple would be at the top of this list of beneficiaries if it weren't for its own separate set of problems. There's a big question mark, for example, around Apple's high-margin services business after the firm's recent quarterly earnings report. Plus, Google's search business, from which Apple derives significant revenue, is another risk after Services chief Eddie Cue said last week that Google searches on devices have declined. Still, Jim said, \"Obviously, we want to stay with Apple.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AVGO, APPL, NVDA, AMZN. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Although no concrete announcements were made about tariffs, officials from both countries hinted at steps toward cooperation, helping calm Wall Street after months of tension.The White House suggested that a deal might be in the works to address America’s widening global trade deficit, while Chinese officials confirmed they would set up a \"mechanism\" to continue discussions on trade and the broader economy. These developments offered hope that tensions could ease between the world’s two largest economies. U.S. stock futures are soaring on Monday, May 12, 2025, as investors cheer a significant breakthrough in U.S.-China trade relations. The two nations agreed to a 90-day pause on most tariffs, sharply reducing levies on each other's imports, which has sparked a broad rally across equity markets.While the market rally is encouraging, analysts advise caution due to ongoing inflation risks and the temporary nature of the tariff truce. The 90-day period is intended for further negotiations, and the outcome remains uncertain.Following the weekend talks, Dow Jones futures jumped by 401 points or 0.97%. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures climbed 1.15%, and Nasdaq futures surged 1.45%. Investors saw this as a sign that both Washington and Beijing were moving away from a trade war and toward long-term negotiations.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters, “I’m happy to report that we’ve made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks.” Bessent said more detailed information will be shared Monday.Jamieson Greer, U.S. Trade Representative, added context by pointing to the $1.2 trillion trade deficit: “The president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs... we’re confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to work toward resolving that national emergency.”China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng, who led the Chinese delegation, also shared positive feedback. He confirmed that the two countries had agreed to form “a consultation mechanism” for future trade and economic talks.Although both sides remained vague on specific tariff changes, this alone was seen as a step forward. Markets had feared more aggressive moves after the U.S. hit China with a steep 145% tariff, prompting a 125% retaliation from Beijing. Instead, the tone was one of collaboration.The U.S. dollar gained some ground, rising 0.1% against the euro and 0.25% versus the yen. Meanwhile, gold prices dropped 2% to $3,273 per ounce, as investor anxiety eased and the dollar regained some appeal.In bond markets, the 10-year Treasury yield ticked up slightly by less than 1 basis point to 4.382%.Oil markets also reflected cautious optimism. U.S. crude oil prices rose 0.57% to $61.37 per barrel, while Brent crude edged higher by 0.49% to $64.22.Just as futures surged, they briefly dipped after President Donald Trump posted on social media about plans to sign an executive order aimed at slashing prescription drug prices. He claimed prices could drop between 30% and 80%, raising questions about pharmaceutical companies’ future earnings. This caused some traders to hit pause on the rally.Still, the broader mood remained optimistic thanks to the progress in trade talks.The market will be watching closely on Monday for more details from U.S. officials about the trade framework. In addition, several key economic indicators are on deck that could impact investor sentiment further:Federal Reserve officials are also scheduled to speak throughout the week. After holding interest rates steady last week, any shift in tone could further sway markets.While a full U.S.-China trade deal wasn’t expected from these talks, the weekend's outcomes suggest both sides are aiming to reduce tensions and keep discussions going.Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, summed it up well: “Not the worst-case outcome that was possible from this weekend’s talks, far from it, but not a concrete deal either.”At this point, Wall Street seems satisfied with that. With both economies under pressure and markets craving stability, even a framework for further dialogue is a step in the right direction.Positive signs from trade discussions boosted investor confidence, pushing Dow futures up 401 points.Not yet, but both sides agreed to keep talking and reduce trade tensions."}

The broader S&P 500 gained 3.26%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 4.35%. The three major indexes each posted their biggest single-day gains in over one month.\n\n“The sharp market rally today reflects the unexpectedly positive tariff news,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, in a Monday note. “Many investors were not positioned for this outcome, leading to a significant market surge.”\n\nThe Nasdaq, which had entered a bear market on April 4, closed up more than 20% from its lowest point this year — exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.)\n\nIt’s been a swift recovery in recent weeks for the Nasdaq, though the index is still down about 3.1% this year.\n\nMarkets cheer easing trade tensions\n\nUS stocks on Monday firmly erased all their losses since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” trade announcement, which placed a 10% tariff on practically all goods coming into the United States and set significantly higher tariffs on dozens of countries. Trump paused most of those tariffs just days after they went into effect but jacked up import taxes on China — eventually to 145% on most Chinese imports.\n\nIn turn, China hiked tariffs on US goods to 125%. The tit-for-tat trade war had effectively stopped trade between the two countries, risking substantial price hikes and shortages.\n\nTrump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both had said in recent weeks that tariffs on China had grown unsustainably high and a détente was necessary. But few believed that the result of the discussions between Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts in Geneva this weekend was going to be quite so significant.\n\nBoth sides agreed to axe tariffs by 115 percentage points, still leaving the levies considerably higher than where they were before Trump took office in January — but much, much lower than the historic level over the past month that deeply concerned American businesses, consumers, economists and investors.\n\n“No one had these low China tariff rates on their bingo cards,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in an email. “This is a big positive surprise.”\n\nAnother key element of the discussions: Bessent said the US and China had put in place a mechanism to avoid raising tariffs on each other again, suggesting that the worst of the trade war may be behind us.\n\nTrump said as much during a Monday press conference. When asked if the tariffs on Chinese exports would snap back to 145% if there were to be an impasse on trade talks, Trump said, “No.”\n\n“No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said. “I think you will have a deal, however.”\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Richard Drew/AP\n\nThe de-escalation of US-China tariffs further reduces global recession risks, Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors Monday morning.\n\n“The market’s resilience itself is making a recession less likely by easing financial conditions,” he wrote. “And policymakers don’t want a downturn or market turmoil either, as we saw with the 90-day extension to the reciprocal tariffs.”\n\nAs a result, Wall Street cheered Monday morning. Investors showed greater appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. The US dollar rose 1.4% against a basket of currencies. US oil, which had tumbled as investors feared a demand vacuum because of a tariff-induced global recession, surged 1.52% to $61.95 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.64% to $64.96 a barrel.\n\nBy contrast, investors sold off save-haven assets, such as gold, which tumbled 2.7%. US Treasuries also fell, sending the 10-year yield back above 4.45%. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. Japan’s yen fell 2% against the dollar.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, sank more than 15% to its lowest level since the end of March. “Greed” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed index. The index had been staunchly in “extreme fear” and “fear” this year before surging into “greed” this month.\n\n“The larger-than-expected drop in the tariffs between the US and China, while temporary, and the establishment of a framework for continued discussion, is exactly what the stock market was hoping to see,” said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth.\n\nTech stocks were particular winners on Monday: Despite a recent US carveout for hardware from tariffs on China, tech had been rocked in particular by the trade war between the US and China, because of the deeply intertwined relationship between American and Chinese technology sectors. Apple (AAPL) gained 6.3%, Tesla (TSLA) rose 6.75%, Nvidia (NVDA) was up 5.4%, Amazon (AMZN) rose 8.1% and Intel (INTC) was up 3.55%.\n\nStocks of luxury goods makers, which had tumbled in recent months, bounced back sharply: Hermes rose 3.5%, Burberry was up 3.67% and LVMH surged 7%.\n\nAutomakers also surged: Jeep and Chrysler maker Stellantis (STLA) was up 6.5%, General Motors (GM) rose 4.4% and Ford (F) was up 2.6%.\n\n“The risk-on move in markets suggests that investors had not expected such a positive outcome to come so quickly,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Monday note. “Investors will now be focused on signs that the temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement.”\n\nA bad time for a trade war\n\nBessent on Monday morning characterized the trade war de-escalation that he helped negotiate this weekend with his Chinese counterparts as tough but respectful.\n\n“We were firm, and we moved forward,” Bessent told CNBC from Geneva. “We tried to identify shared interest. We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.”\n\nBessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China’s economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war.\n\n“I had seen what’s going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what’s going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country.\n\nHistorically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.”\n\nBut, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war.

The broader S&P 500 gained 3.26%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 4.35%. The three major indexes each posted their biggest single-day gains in over one month.\n\n“The sharp market rally today reflects the unexpectedly positive tariff news,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, in a Monday note. “Many investors were not positioned for this outcome, leading to a significant market surge.”\n\nThe Nasdaq, which had entered a bear market on April 4, closed up more than 20% from its lowest point this year — exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.)\n\nIt’s been a swift recovery in recent weeks for the Nasdaq, though the index is still down about 3.1% this year.\n\nMarkets cheer easing trade tensions\n\nUS stocks on Monday firmly erased all their losses since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” trade announcement, which placed a 10% tariff on practically all goods coming into the United States and set significantly higher tariffs on dozens of countries. Trump paused most of those tariffs just days after they went into effect but jacked up import taxes on China — eventually to 145% on most Chinese imports.\n\nIn turn, China hiked tariffs on US goods to 125%. The tit-for-tat trade war had effectively stopped trade between the two countries, risking substantial price hikes and shortages.\n\nTrump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both had said in recent weeks that tariffs on China had grown unsustainably high and a détente was necessary. But few believed that the result of the discussions between Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts in Geneva this weekend was going to be quite so significant.\n\nBoth sides agreed to axe tariffs by 115 percentage points, still leaving the levies considerably higher than where they were before Trump took office in January — but much, much lower than the historic level over the past month that deeply concerned American businesses, consumers, economists and investors.\n\n“No one had these low China tariff rates on their bingo cards,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in an email. “This is a big positive surprise.”\n\nAnother key element of the discussions: Bessent said the US and China had put in place a mechanism to avoid raising tariffs on each other again, suggesting that the worst of the trade war may be behind us.\n\nTrump said as much during a Monday press conference. When asked if the tariffs on Chinese exports would snap back to 145% if there were to be an impasse on trade talks, Trump said, “No.”\n\n“No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said. “I think you will have a deal, however.”\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Richard Drew/AP\n\nThe de-escalation of US-China tariffs further reduces global recession risks, Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors Monday morning.\n\n“The market’s resilience itself is making a recession less likely by easing financial conditions,” he wrote. “And policymakers don’t want a downturn or market turmoil either, as we saw with the 90-day extension to the reciprocal tariffs.”\n\nAs a result, Wall Street cheered Monday morning. Investors showed greater appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. The US dollar rose 1.4% against a basket of currencies. US oil, which had tumbled as investors feared a demand vacuum because of a tariff-induced global recession, surged 1.52% to $61.95 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.64% to $64.96 a barrel.\n\nBy contrast, investors sold off save-haven assets, such as gold, which tumbled 2.7%. US Treasuries also fell, sending the 10-year yield back above 4.45%. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. Japan’s yen fell 2% against the dollar.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, sank more than 15% to its lowest level since the end of March. “Greed” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed index. The index had been staunchly in “extreme fear” and “fear” this year before surging into “greed” this month.\n\n“The larger-than-expected drop in the tariffs between the US and China, while temporary, and the establishment of a framework for continued discussion, is exactly what the stock market was hoping to see,” said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth.\n\nTech stocks were particular winners on Monday: Despite a recent US carveout for hardware from tariffs on China, tech had been rocked in particular by the trade war between the US and China, because of the deeply intertwined relationship between American and Chinese technology sectors. Apple (AAPL) gained 6.3%, Tesla (TSLA) rose 6.75%, Nvidia (NVDA) was up 5.4%, Amazon (AMZN) rose 8.1% and Intel (INTC) was up 3.55%.\n\nStocks of luxury goods makers, which had tumbled in recent months, bounced back sharply: Hermes rose 3.5%, Burberry was up 3.67% and LVMH surged 7%.\n\nAutomakers also surged: Jeep and Chrysler maker Stellantis (STLA) was up 6.5%, General Motors (GM) rose 4.4% and Ford (F) was up 2.6%.\n\n“The risk-on move in markets suggests that investors had not expected such a positive outcome to come so quickly,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Monday note. “Investors will now be focused on signs that the temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement.”\n\nA bad time for a trade war\n\nBessent on Monday morning characterized the trade war de-escalation that he helped negotiate this weekend with his Chinese counterparts as tough but respectful.\n\n“We were firm, and we moved forward,” Bessent told CNBC from Geneva. “We tried to identify shared interest. We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.”\n\nBessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China’s economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war.\n\n“I had seen what’s going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what’s going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country.\n\nHistorically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.”\n\nBut, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America. And investors had braced for a recession, as economists said the US economy could get hit particularly hard by the trade war.\n\nContainers are seen at the port in Lianyungang, in China's eastern Jiangsu province, on May 1.
