In what Wedbush analysts are calling a \ufffdwatershed moment\ufffd for Big Tech, recent developments in the region mean the AI boom might be rapidly shifting its center of gravity.\nA wave of investment in AI infrastructure across Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is signaling an acceleration in U.S. tech companies\ufffd expansion abroad. According to a Monday note from analysts led by Dan Ives, the region is poised to become one of the most important global markets for AI over the next decade, potentially adding over $1 trillion.\n\ufffdWe believe the market opportunity in Saudi Arabia and UAE alone could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years,\ufffd the note said, \ufffdand this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names in our view.\ufffd\nWedbush wrote that it is becoming \ufffdcrystal clear\ufffd that the \ufffdAI Revolution has found its next major area of penetration...the Middle East.\ufffd\nThis inflection point comes on the heels of President Donald Trump\ufffds recent high-profile visit to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, which focused heavily on U.S. involvement in the region\ufffds ambitious AI infrastructure plans. Among the standout deals: Humain, a Saudi-backed AI startup, announced it will deploy 18,000 of Nvidia\ufffds (NVDA-1.54%) cutting-edge AI chips to power a 500-megawatt data center \ufffd one of the largest of its kind.\n\ufffd[That announcement] is the start of a new era of growth for the US tech sector and a gamechanger for the industry,\ufffd the note said. \ufffdRiyadh and UAE will be a major buyer of AI chips, software, autonomous/robotics, and datacenters over the next decade.\ufffd\nFor decades, the Gulf region has leveraged its oil wealth to diversify into new markets: finance, tourism, and energy-transition technologies. But this focus on AI might mark its most ambitious pivot yet. Governments in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi aren\ufffdt just buying chips \ufffd they\ufffdre buying a future in which the Middle East becomes a global AI hub.\nAt the core of this strategy is a growing alliance between Gulf governments and U.S. technology companies. Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%), Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), Alphabet (GOOGL-1.57%), Palantir (PLTR+1.01%), and Tesla (TSLA-3.33%) are all positioning themselves in the region to be key players in what could be full-throttle AI buildout.\nThe sharp pivot to the Middle East comes amid tensions between the U.S. and China. While Saudi Arabia is rolling out the red carpet for Nvidia\ufffds latest-generation chips, China is seeing growing restrictions even on underpowered GPUs such as the H20, as the U.S. attempts to restrain the country\ufffds domestic AI ambitions. \nThis divergence is shaping up to be a central theme in the larger AI race. Wedbush characterized the Trump administration\ufffds positioning as a \ufffdglobal game of high-stakes poker\ufffd to isolate China while turbocharging U.S. influence in the Gulf through technology.\n\ufffdChina is clearly taking notice and this adds to the drama of the broader US/China tariff/trade talks over the coming months,\ufffd Wedbush said.\nThe note said these developments are a \ufffdbullish indicator that further shows the US tech\ufffds lead in this 4th Industrial Revolution.\ufffd\nAnd at the center of it all is Nvidia \ufffd and the \ufffdGodfather of AI,\ufffd as Wedbush calls CEO Jensen Huang \ufffd cementing its position not just as a hardware company, but as a geopolitical force shaping the future of artificial intelligence.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."}

For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747, or visit the website at www.graniteshares.com.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply.\nFund Risks\nMultiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock\ufffds performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock\ufffds performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. \nThe Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with \ufffdLong\ufffd in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with \ufffdShort\ufffd in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund).\nInvestors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security.\nFor the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day\ufffds return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day\ufffds returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock\ufffds performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock\ufffds performance increases over a period longer than a single day.\nFor the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day\ufffds return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day\ufffds returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock\ufffds performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock\ufffds performance decreases over a period longer than a single day.\nShares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.\nAn investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus.\nInvesting in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction.\nA liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate.\nDerivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses.\nThis information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.
