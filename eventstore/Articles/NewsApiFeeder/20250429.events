The tech giant wants parents to teach children never to enter personal information into the chatbot, and to think critically about Gemini’s answers and always double-check responses.\n\n“Remind [your child] that Gemini isn’t human. Even though it sometimes talks like one, it can’t think for itself or feel emotions,” Google writes in the email to parents, who can disable Gemini access for their kids via the Family Link app or website."}

Looking spend less? Look no further than Philips Hue’s sibling brand, which just unveiled its own cheaper alternative.\n\nSignify-owned WiZ Connected has just announced the WiZ HDMI Sync Box with TV Backlight, which—similar to Hue’s own Play HDMI Sync Box 8K—syncs your smart lights with the signals coming from an HDMI-enabled video source.\n\nThe HDMI Sync Box comes with a segmented LED light strip (versions for sets between 55-65 inches and 75-85 inches are available) that attaches to the back of your TV on three sides.\n\nThe box can also connect with your other WiZ smart lights via Wi-Fi, and an unlimited number of smart lights is supported. The only limitation is that all the lights must be on the same Wi-Fi network, and they must support both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.\n\nSignify\n\nThe device offers four preset sync modes—Cinematic, Vibrant, Relaxation, and Rhythmic—or you can customize the brightness, color saturation, and intensity manually. There’s also a built-in microphone that lets the WiZ box sync your lights with music from nearby audio sources.\n\nFinally, there’s the price: just $89.99, a fraction of the $349.99 list price for the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K.\n\nSo, what’s the catch? For starters, there’s the whole 8K thing—specifically, the HDMI 2.1-enabled Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K supports 8K video at 60Hz, as well as 4K images at 120Hz, ideal for use with current-generation gaming consoles like the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox Series X. The WiZ HDMI Sync Box, in contrast, is limited to HDMI 2.0, and thus supports a top resolution of 4K at 60Hz.\n\nAnother drawback of the WiZ device is that it only has a single HDMI input, versus four for the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 4K. That means the WiZ device can only handle one video input at a time, although you can boost that number with an outboard HDMI switch.\n\nStill, the WiZ HDMI Sync Box does support HDR, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, making it a solid choice for those looking to add an extra dose of immersion to Netflix, Max, or Disney+ binge-watching sessions.\n\nBesides the WiZ HDMI Sync Box with TV Backlight, the brand is also announcing two other new smart lighting devices, both of which could be paired with sync box.\n\nFirst comes the WiZ Gradient Floor light ($89), a tall, thin, floor-standing smart light that splashes swaths of color on the wall, similar to the Philips Hue Signe Floor Lamp.\n\nSignify\n\nAlso coming soon are the WiZ Gradient Light Bars ($59), with shine in multi-colored light and can be mounted either horizontally or vertically.\n\nAll the new WiZ products are expected to ship starting in May, and we’ll have in-depth reviews once we spend quality time with review units."}

Debbie Dingell said Tuesday that her colleague filing articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump is a “distraction.”\n\nDemocratic Michigan Rep. Shri Thanedar announced Monday that he filed seven articles of impeachment against Trump, which included accusations of abusing executive and trade powers and defying Congress by removing their power of the purse. Dingell told MSNBC’s Chris Jansing that her colleague’s attempt to impeach Trump is distracting the Democrat Party from discussing kitchen table issues.\n\n“I’m gonna be very blunt that we have to be making sure that people are seeing what we are doing. I don’t agree with my colleague on what he did. I think it’s a distraction. I think we need to be focused on the issues that people talk about at the kitchen table every night and show them what they’re doing. I think this next month, we’re gonna be very focused on protecting people’s healthcare, making sure that we keep rural hospitals operating, that our children and our seniors are gonna have access to the healthcare that they need and be taken care of in their retirement. That’s what we need to be focused on and delivering.” (RELATED: Chuck Schumer Does Not Rule Out Impeaching Trump If Dems Take Back Control)\n\nWATCH:\n\nThanedar accused Trump of defying a Supreme Court ruling which ordered that the administration must “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member deported to El Salvador. The congressman said the alleged defiance was the “final straw,” stating that Trump must be impeached.\n\n“Trump has already done real damage to our democracy by defying a unanimous 9-0 Supreme Court ruling. That has to be the final straw. It’s time we impeach Donald J. Trump,” Thanedar said.\n\nWhile the Trump administration stated they had mistakenly deported Garcia, they maintained that he should remain in El Salvador due to his alleged MS-13 association and past deportation orders against him from 2019. Following the deportation of Garcia, El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said on April 14 that he will not smuggle Garcia back into the U.S.\n\nDemocrat Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff said at a Friday town hall that Trump has “exceeded any prior standard for impeachment.” In the House of Representatives, Democrat Texas Rep. Al Green announced in February that he would move to impeach Trump just three weeks after he began his second term.\n\nGreen further told reporters on April 5 that he will bring articles of impeachment against the president in the next 30 days, stating that he does not deserve to hold public office.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Both are light enough to take with your on a trip, and the smaller will slip in your pocket. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nThere are plenty of 3-in-1 magnetic chargers that cater for all your Apple portable device needs, charging iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch.\n\nIndeed, we’ve reviewed and tested the best 3-in-1 Apple chargers. Some are stands that sit on your desk or nightstand, while others fold up to fit in your pocket.\n\nThe HyperJuice Qi2 3-in-1 Magnetic Charging Stand sits somewhere in between.\n\nIt has a smaller sibling, predictably called the Qi2 2-in-1 Magnetic Charging Stand. This is much more pocketable, but still offers fast charging when connected to a USB-C charger. It can charge those same three Apple products, but not three at a time.\n\nDominik Tomaszewski / Foundry\n\nDesign\n\nIt’s small enough to be portable but not so svelte that it will slip into your pant pocket or purse. It weighs little (9.6oz, 272g) and is a tight-little shape measuring just 2.8 x 2.8 x 3.1 inches (7 x 7 x 8cm). You won’t notice it in your backpack or suitcase, although I’d want to safeguard its good looks in a pouch or some other protection.\n\nIt’s cute and cleverly designed. The top 15W Qi2 wireless iPhone charger can be kept flat for charging or lifted to act like an adjustable—if low—stand. Qi2 is becoming the fast and affordable magnetic wireless charging standard that is just as fast as Apple’s certified MagSafe, to which it is fully compatible.\n\nWhen lifted, a pull-up Apple. Watch charger is revealed that lays out flat on the right-hand side. This is Apple certified to fast charge the Watch at 5W.\n\nUnderneath is the 5W Qi wireless-charging base for an AirPods case.\n\nIt’s priced the same as the equally modern-looking Journey Nova 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station, but that is a much larger statement charger.\n\nWireless all rounder\n\nAll three Apple devices can be charged at the same time, and all wirelessly.\n\nYou’ll need to add your own USB-C charger—of at least 30W—to connect the Hyper Charging Stand to a power source.\n\nDominik Tomaszewski / Foundry\n\n2-in-1 in your pocket\n\nHyper also makes a 2-in-1 version that can charge an iPhone and Watch at the same time, but don’t worry if you own AirPods as you can balance the earbuds’ case on the phone-charging pad instead when you need to.\n\nWhat makes the Hyperjuice 2-in-1 Magnetic Charging Stand special is its highly pocketable shape and size. The round charger weighs just 3.5oz (100g) and folds up into a 2.4 x 2.4 x 0.8 inch (6.2 x 6.2 x 2.1cm) disc. You are more likely to lose the charger in your bag than notice its presence when carrying it. Remember, though, that you still need to connect it to a wall charger for it to work as it’s not a magnetic power bank.\n\nDominik Tomaszewski / Foundry\n\nA metal leg pulls out of the back of the 2-in-1 to create a robust stand. With the Watch-charging pad tucked away, you can flip it 180 degrees for an even sturdier stand base..\n\n15W Qui2 for iPhone charging and 5W Watch power means you get the fastest wireless charging available.\n\nWe have tested a bunch more of the best 2-in-1 Apple chargers.\n\nHyperJuice Qi2 2-in-1 Magnetic Charging Stand\n\nShould you buy the HyperJuice Qi2 3-in-1 or 2-in-1 Magnetic Charging Stand?\n\nThe HyperJuice Qi2 3-in-1 Magnetic Charging Stand is priced at $119.99 / £119.99. The 2-in-1 is a little cheaper at $99.99 / £99.99.\n\nNeither is a throwaway price, but the 3-in-1 is a compact, good-looking multi-device charger that looks sharp in a modern home or work environment. The 2-in-1 is a really cute and clever charger. Each works both at home or on your travels and incorporates all the fastest wireless charging speeds."}

Luckily, the developers have put out a statement to assuage player concerns, confirming that a new battle pass-like Warbond is coming in May and that there's something else big in the works, too.\n\n\"We know it’s been a while since our last update, fear not—we are cooking!\" wrote Arrowhead on social media. \"You may have noticed that the gap between our major updates and Warbond releases is a little longer this time. But we’re happy to say we’ll be announcing our next Warbond on May 8, and there will be more exciting news to come not long after.\"\n\n\"We won’t stand on ceremony too much in revealing what that Warbond might be, but you’ll hear more from us soon,\" continued the studio. \"Until then: stand up straight, polish those boots and keep that uniform in tip-top condition, Helldivers. You’ll be needing them for the fight to come.\"\n\nIlluminate Overseers as they appear in Helldivers 2. (Image credit: PlayStation Studios)\n\nThe post came alongside a screenshot of a Super Earth flag like the one you have to carry in the Helldivers 2 tutorial. Some think this might be a tease of a new stratagem coming in the upcoming Warbond that lets you carry and/or plant flags to give you and your teammates buffs, but that's ultimately just speculation.\n\nAnother thing to note is that this announcement was made just before an official victory over the Illuminate — Helldivers 2's third enemy faction that was introduced in December last year — was declared in-game, as the completion of a recent Major Order saw players finally stop the Meridian Singularity black hole that's been hurtling towards Super Earth since February. As a result of this, the Illuminate have actually been wiped off the Galactic War map completely, and Super Earth High Command suggests we'll never see the squids in our galaxy again.\n\n...Of course, nobody actually believes that. In fact, this period of \"we did it, the Illuminate are gone for good!\" celebration only reaffirms my belief that hidden messages found in March were foreshadowing a large and committed invasion of Super Earth and her colonies instead of the sporadic hit-and-run attacks the aliens have done thus far.\n\nIn previous articles, I've written my prediction that the Meridian black hole is ultimately what the Illuminate will invade through, and that the enemy set it on a destructive path through several human-controlled worlds to both soften us up and move its proverbial beachhead as close to Super Earth as possible. And now, in the wake of the Illuminate's \"defeat,\" I'm getting the sinking feeling that I was absolutely right.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe Double-Edged Sickle is one of the best anti-Illuminate weapons, provided you build around it with flame-resistant armor and the Vitality Enhancement booster. (Image credit: PlayStation Studios)\n\nAside from the fact that removing a faction after introducing it just a few months ago would be quite disappointing, a big reason why I'm confident the squids will be back in full force is because this has actually happened for. Longtime Helldivers 2 players will recall that the Automatons were thought to be eliminated for good last April, only for the mechanized menace to deploy a colossal counter-attack invasion fleet that saw the introduction of new hostile units like factory striders and gunships.\n\nFrankly, I would be shocked if something similar doesn't occur here, especially since the Illuminate only field five different enemy types (Voteless, Overseers, Elevated Overseers, Harvesters, and Watcher drones) right now. Many have been hoping to see the faction expanded with more units to fight, and if you ask me, there's no better time for that then the start of a proper large-scale assault by the squids.\n\nUltimately, I'm sure we'll find out soon enough, as I don't expect we'll have to wait long to see what happens next after the new Warbond is revealed on May 8. Until then, all we can do is continue the ongoing campaigns against the Automatons and the Terminids; when the Illuminate inevitably shows itself again, the last thing we'd want is for the bots and bugs to be on our doorstep, too.\n\nHelldivers 2 stands tall as one of the best PC games and best PS5 games to play if you're into co-op shooters, intense sci-fi action, goofy physics antics, and goofy satirical writing. It's typically $40, though you can often get it for less if you shop around for discounts. Right now, the best one is CDKeys' sale that shaves almost $10 off the price, allowing you to get the bombastic title for just over $30."}

The biggest draw of this update is the profile manager feature that makes it easier to separate work, play, and everything else. With separate user profiles, you’ll be able to have separate bookmarks, tabs, browsing history, and more.\n\nProfile management has long been one of the defining benefits of Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers over Firefox. Although Mozilla has tried to bridge that gap with features like Containers, and others have tried to replicate profiles via extensions, none of the solutions have ever offered quite the same benefits and convenience.\n\nWindows users will also be pleased to see that the designs of menus and windows have been adapted to fit the rest of the operating system. Other minor features include tab groups and weather suggestions in the address bar. Otherwise, the rest of the update mainly treats us to bug fixes and security issues addressed.\n\nIf you want to check if you’re running the latest version, navigate to About Firefox in the menu. If you have an older version, simply restart the browser and the update will be installed automatically. Alternatively, go to the Firefox download page and manually download the latest version for Windows, macOS, or Linux."}

Consider this HP laptop that’s only $350 at Best Buy, a solid $230 off its MSRP right now.\n\nThis isn’t some rocket ship of a laptop in any shape or form, but it will get you through the day without issue. The laptop runs on an AMD Ryzen 5 processor and 8GB of RAM, which is less than the 16GB we normally recommend for a Windows laptop, but it’s still good enough—and it’s hard to complain at this price. The Ryzen 5 is a perfectly decent processor that can handle everyday needs, and the 512GB SSD on board means you’re covered when it comes to fast transferring files, booting up your system and apps in a flash, and more.\n\nOne of the best things about this $350 laptop, though? The fact that it has a touchscreen display. The 1366×768 resolution may not be impressive on the large 15.6-inch screen, but it’s not common for a budget laptop like this to be touch-enabled, allowing you to conveniently tap your apps and links. HP claims the laptop’s battery will last for well over 12 hours, but even if it doesn’t, that’s long enough for the price.\n\nIf you need a no-fuss laptop that won’t break the bank, this basic 15.6-inch HP laptop for $350 is a solid deal that’ll serve you well.

In doing so, the team from the University of Kansas (KU) found ravenous black holes at the hearts of galaxies during \"cosmic noon\" experiencing a wild growth spurt.\n\nCosmic noon is a mysterious period of the universe's evolution, around 2 billion to 3 billion years after the Big Bang, when galaxies like the Milky Way were rapidly forming stars in a process called \"starburst.\" This growth through star formation was so intense that the team behind this research thinks half of all stars seen in modern galaxies originated during cosmic noon.\n\n\n\nThe team conducted the MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey with the James Webb Space Telescope to better understand this crucial epoch in the universe's 13.8-billion-year history.\n\n\"We want to understand how these galaxies are forming stars, how many stars they're forming, and especially how the black holes at their centers are growing,\" project principal investigator and KU researcher Allison Kirkpatrick said in a statement. \"Our goal with this project is to conduct the largest JWST survey in the mid-infrared across multiple bandwidths.\"\n\nRelated: Has the James Webb Space Telescope discovered a 'missing' supermassive black hole? (video)\n\nThe MEGA galaxies observed by the JWST variation in color and morphology, giving insight into the galaxies' ages, dust content and star formation. (Image credit: NASA/JWST/Backhaus)\n\nThese cosmic noon galaxies are shrouded in thick clouds of dust, which efficiently absorb visible light, making them difficult to study. However, the dusty shrouds are less adept at absorbing infrared light, making the JWST the ideal instrument to peer deeper into these early galaxies than ever before.\n\n\n\n\"The mid-infrared is where dust emits, so we’re looking at dust-obscured galaxies,\" Kirkpatrick said. \"Dust hides many things, and we want to peer behind the dust.\"\n\nExploring the Extended Groth Strip\n\nThe team applied the JWST's infrared observing power to a galaxy-rich strip of space located near the constellation of Ursa Major, called the Extended Groth Strip.\n\n\n\n\"The Extended Groth Strip is a region of the sky that has now become one of the premier JWST fields,” Kirkpatrick said. “Within this region, we're able to see about 10,000 galaxies — even though the area is only roughly the diameter of the moon.\"\n\nKirkpatrick and colleagues used the Extended Groth Strip as a hunting ground for galaxies with ravenously feeding and thus rapidly growing supermassive black holes at their hearts.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

What could possibly hide such a ravenous cosmic titan? (Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nThough black holes themselves emit no light, their immense gravitational influence generates friction in the material that swirls around them. This heats that material to tremendously high temperatures, causing these regions called \"active galactic nuclei,\" or \"AGNs,\" to glow brightly.\n\n\n\nThe theory is that some of the AGN-hosting galaxies seen for the first time in infrared in the MEGA data are ancestors of Milky Way-like galaxies. That means measuring how fast their black holes feed, how rapidly they birth stars, and how their appearance changes due to mergers and collisions with other galaxies could eventually provide unprecedented information about our own galaxy's formative era.\n\n\n\nCollecting and processing this data has been a painstaking process, and it's actually one you too can assist with.\n\nHow can you get an early look at JWST images?\n\nThe KU team's investigation turned up a vast amount of data and raw images, which the team scoured to produce usable images and information.\n\n\"In theory, a galaxy could show up in one image and not another because we're using different filters,\" team member and KU researcher Bren Backhaus said. \"It's like taking pictures using only red, blue, or green light, which eventually creates very pretty images.\n\n\n\n\"But because the telescope is moving slightly, the images are a little out of frame with each other.\"\n\n\n\nBackhaus added that the first step is simply receiving the images, with the next step involving correcting for known issues with the telescope.\n\n\"For example, there's a known scratch that appears in every image, and there are dead pixels,\" Backhaus explained. \"The first task is to fix or at least tell the software to ignore those pixels.”\n\nIt might not look very eye-catching but this little red dot seen by the JWST is a galaxy that existed around 2 billion years after the Big Bang. (Image credit: NASA/JWST/Backhaus)\n\nBackhaus and colleagues' next goal was to create a catalog by finding a measurable amount of light and recording how much of that light comes in through a given filter.\n\n\n\n\"That was my primary work with the data, and I was really excited because I had never worked with photometry data before,\" Backhaus said. \"It really expanded my skill set, and I got to see beautiful galaxies before anyone else.\"\n\n\n\nThus far, the team's project has used the JWST for 67 hours, with a further 30 hours approved for the future. But the rest of the astronomical community will have to wait to lay their eyes on what the KU team describes as a \"beautiful dataset.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is the largest amount of JWST data we've been able to bring to KU with a principal investigator here, which means KU students have exclusive use of this data for now,\" Kirkpatrick said. \"It's not public yet. The way telescope time works is that, because so much effort goes into writing a proposal, you're given a year of exclusive use of the data. Then it gets released into a public database, but only as raw data.\n\n\n\n\"Anyone can access it, but they'd have to do their own processing, which has taken months in our case.\"\n\nHowever, there is a way you could get early access to the MEGA images. Members of the public can classify the galaxies and help hunt mergers via the Cosmic Collisions Zooniverse project .\n\nThe team's research has been accepted for publication in the journal Astrophysical Journal and is available as a pre-peer reviewed paper on the repository site arXiv.\n\nOriginally posted on Space.com."}

Intel also offered a sneak peek at its 14A process, the next-generation manufacturing technology, which will include “turbo cells” for faster clock speeds.\n\nIntel made the announcements at its Foundry Direct Connect symposium on Tuesday, as the company tries to convince Wall Street and its customers that its manufacturing processes are back on track.\n\nDespite Intel executives’ on-stage promotion of their foundry roadmap, the products consumers will purchase directly influence Intel’s process roadmap. Intel’s upcoming Panther Lake processors will be manufactured on Intel’s 18A process node, completing the “five nodes in four years” goal that former chief executive Pat Gelsinger laid out. Intel’s next-gen 14A should be the technology Intel uses to fabricate “Nova Lake,” due in 2026.\n\nIntel has used foundry partner TSMC to fabricate many of the tiles found within its disaggregated processors like Lunar Lake, and bringing that production in-house will save Intel money as well as demonstrate to customers that it can compete with TSMC.\n\nIntel chief executive Lip-Bu Tan has said previously that Intel 18A is now in “risk production” and will reach volume production this year. Intel 18A includes technologies like RibbonFET, a next-gen “gate all around” transistor, as well as PowerVia, a backside power delivery architecture that can nudge up power performance by 4 percent. Intel 18A is “ready for full product design start” — just another way that Intel is saying that it’s ready to go.\n\nThis is Intel’s process technology roadmap as of April 2025. Intel\n\nOn top of the generic 18A process, Intel has now added two new variants: what it calls 18A-P, designed for “enhanced performance” to a small subset of customers; and 18A-PT, which “builds on 18A-PT performance and power efficiency variants.” Early wafers based on Intel 18A-P are in the fab now, the company said. Intel 18A-PT can be connected to the top die using Foveros Direct 3D with a hybrid bonding interconnect pitch of less than 5 micrometers, Intel said in a statement.\n\nIntel 14A, by contrast, improves upon PowerVia with a new technology called PowerDirect, its second-gen power delivery network. RibbonFET 2 will also improve upon RibbonFET, Intel said. Intel was supposed to move next to an intermediary 20A process but cancelled it.\n\nThe Intel 14A process should offer between 15 to 20 percent more performance per watt than the 18A process, combined with a 1.3X improvement in transistor density and a 25 percent to 35 percent reduction in power, according to Technalysis analyst Bob O’Donnell, who attended the event.\n\nThe most intriguing part of the new 14A process may be something called “turbo cells,” which Intel refers to as a “boosted cell technology.” It will further enhance speed (including CPU maximum frequency and GPU critical paths) when paired with RibbonFET 2, Intel said. That might be key, as Intel and other chipmakers continually struggle with how to improve chip performance.\n\n“Turbo Cells allows designers to optimize a mix of more performant cells and more power-efficient cells within a design block, enabling a tailored balance between power, performance, and area for target applications,” Intel said. It will be combined with High Numerical Aperture (High NA) EUV technology for smaller process features.\n\nIntel 14A and Intel 18A-PT dies can be packaged together, Intel added, using Foveros Connect 3D stacking and embedded multi-die interconnected bridging, or EMIB. Intel is also announcing EMIB-T for future high-bandwidth memory needs as well as two additional Foveros derivatives, Foveros-R and Foveros-B.\n\nThis story was updated at 2:12 PM on April 30 with additional details."}

In 2022, prolific storyteller Chen related a story that was told to him from a colleague who had previously worked on the Windows XP team. There was a problem: somehow, playing back “Rhythm Nation” over a laptop’s speakers would crash the laptop. In fact, it could crash nearby laptops as well. Microsoft tried to isolate the issue, eliminating other variables, and the staff were left with a single conclusion: it was the sound itself that was at fault.\n\nRemember, laptops at the time didn’t ship with the SSDs that they do today. Instead, they used hard drives: 5,400-RPM hard drives with an actuator, magnetic heads, and platters. And it just so happened that “Rhythm Nation” inadvertently hit the resonant frequencies of at least one of the components. The vibration caused faults in the drive. It wasn’t enough to wobble the hard drive’s magnetic head into the platter — though that would do it! — but simply cause enough read faults that the laptop’s OS crashed.\n\nRemember, resonant (or resonance) frequencies are just simple physics. Tap a glass, and it will “ring.” Project the same sound back at the glass, and it will vibrate in sympathy — even shatter. San Francisco’s Exploratorium museum once had a ton or so of metal suspended from a chain, and visitors could try to move the suspended metal using a tiny, cheap, bar magnet on a string. If you pulled slightly at the right time, the metal would eventually move. It’s the same principle that brought the Tacoma Narrows bridge down: small movements at the right frequency combine with one another.\n\nFor some reason, that’s exactly what happened with “Rhythm Nation.” Retired Microsoft engineer Dave Plummer (who worked with Chen) dug into it, too, concluding that something in the song also had hit the published resonance frequency of the Western Digital’s hard-drive platters. But Plummer was unable to reproduce the exact issue, prompting Chen to conclude that Plummer used the wrong hard drive — he used an external 5,400-RPM hard drive, and not one designed for laptops.\n\nThe important consequence of this, however, is that Microsoft specifically engineered in a fix: a specific filter (a notch filter, as Plummer notes) to eliminate or at least downplay the tiny frequency band. For years, if you listened to “Rhythm Nation” on your laptop, you’d hear the song minus that tiny little laptop-killing audio slice.\n\nThe update to this story was Chen’s question: how long did that notch filter remain in place?\n\nEssentially, it remained from Windows XP (2001) until Windows 7 (2009), because Chen reported that another PC vendor still remained freaked out by Janet’s ability to crash laptops. Microsoft had tried to put in a rule that would make it possible to disable with all “Audio Processing Objects (APOs),” which included the notch filter.\n\n“The vendor applied for an exception to this rule on the grounds that disabling their APO could result in physical damage to the computer,” Chen wrote. “If it were possible to disable their APO, word would get out that “You can get heavier bass if you go through these steps,” and of course you want more bass, right? I mean, who doesn’t want more bass? So people would uncheck the box and enjoy richer bass for a while, and then at some point in the future, the computer would crash mysteriously or (worse) produce incorrect results.”\n\nThe waiver meant that even if all of the APOs were disabled, the notch filter would remain in place. It was granted.\n\nOf course, virtually all laptops today use SSDs, which don’t include mechanical components that can be affected by vibration. That’s not to say that the materials of an SSD don’t have their own resonance frequencies — they do, but there’s no indication that hitting them would even be possible with an audible tone, or that it could cause errors to occur.\n\nThat’s kind of a shame. Imagine how different the world would be if “Baby Shark” had caused laptops to fail. “Sorry, kiddo — guess we’ll have to listen to Daddy’s music instead.”"}

Its two previous 34-inch ultrawide models were already bargains (for OLEDs, anyway), but the newest one is even cheaper and faster… and it’s on sale starting today.\n\nThe Alienware AW3425DW is very similar to the company’s previous designs, though it gets a bit of a refresh in its stand and styling. The newer OLED panel is also faster—a full 240Hz—while retaining the semi-standard 3440×1440 ultrawide resolution. The new design also gets a USB-C port, something conspicuously absent from both previous models… but don’t get too excited because it’s only 15 watts and there’s nothing in the specs to indicate this port can handle video input. So this monitor isn’t ideal for a gaming laptop, but it’s still serviceable.\n\nThat said, with a starting price of just $799.99, I think a lot of gamers will be willing to overlook that detail, especially considering the OLED panel gets a three-year warranty against burn-in and other defects. Personally, if I were hunting for an OLED monitor deal, I’d wait on this one since Dell frequently discounts even its most high-end monitors. But with the US tariff situation in constant flux, it might be worth biting the bullet now.\n\nIt’s shipping today. Alienware also has new 27-inch OLEDs launched recently, in 4K@240Hz and 1440p@280Hz flavors."}

So, here are 15 SEO essentials to focus on in this year and beyond. Whether you are a beginner or an SEO expert, these tips will help you focus on what’s important right now.\n\nIn collaboration with our Principal SEO, Alex Moss\n\nArtificial intelligence is making every part of SEO faster and more efficient, from keyword research to real-time performance tracking. Tools like Semrush and Ahrefs help you plan content quickly and uncover opportunities you might have missed. These platforms use data in new ways to help you improve your strategy based on live trends and competitor changes. Use tools like ChatGPT or Gemini for research, inspiration, coding, and data analysis.\n\nThanks to AI tools, you can automate time-consuming tasks like technical audits, site crawls, and content analysis. The time you win by doing that helps your team focus on the bigger picture, from setting the strategy, building authority, and creating content that connects with audiences and brings something new to the world.\n\nYoast SEO’s AI features offer guidance to help your content succeed.\n\nDid you know? Yoast is 15 years old! We’re celebrating 15 years of Yoast this year and have all kinds of nice stuff planned. Of course, we’re also offering a deal on our SEO products.

You’ll see AI overviews, featured snippets, knowledge panels, People Also Ask boxes, and more. To be featured in those places, your content has to be high-quality and unique, above all, unique – regurgitating what’s already out there won’t cut it. But, it also has to be easy to read and scan. Don’t forget to use lists, highlighted snippets, and concise definitions at the top of your articles.\n\nKeyword research helps you to find the questions your audience is asking. Write clear answers to those questions, making them as concise as possible. Use tools like AlsoAsked to find opportunities to rank even when a user doesn’t click through to your site.\n\n3. Invest in video content\n\nVideo dominates search results and offers a good way to diversify traffic sources. The growth of a platform like TikTok shows that many people prefer consuming video content. Create videos that answer questions, demonstrate your products, or explain complex topics. Optimize the videos to make them easy to find, and don’t forget to add a transcript and timestamps to help with indexing and user experience.\n\nDepending on your video strategy, hosting them on YouTube and embedding them on your site can boost engagement and dwell time. YouTube is the second-largest search engine in the world, and building a solid presence there can reach a massive audience.\n\n4. Improve e-commerce SEO\n\nSEO for your products is not just about rankings, but also about conversion. Your product titles and descriptions should naturally include your most important keywords while also sounding persuasive. Don’t forget your category pages! Proper optimization helps customers find what they need. At the same time, you are building a strong internal linking structure.\n\nStructured data is essential for e-commerce stores because it can trigger rich results, highlighting reviews, pricing, and stock status. When done well, these show up nicely in Google, boosting your visibility. Rich snippets make your SERP listings more trustworthy and clickable. Do everything you can to get more traffic and, eventually, more sales. Our Yoast SEO for Shopify app can help your business succeed.\n\n5. Prioritize local SEO\n\nIf your business is locally oriented, local SEO should be at the top of your strategy. Keep your Google Business profile updated with opening hours, services, and nice photos. Post regularly about special offers, events, or published blog posts to show you are active and encourage engagement.\n\nBuild citations in trusted local directories and get high-quality local backlinks. You should publish high-quality, localized content or case studies from regional customers. This signals that you are active in a geographic area, which could help local search visibility — Yoast Local SEO helps you do this.\n\n6. Improve user experience (UX)\n\nUX and SEO are deeply connected; we all know that. If people can’t use your site, they won’t stick around. Focus on a clean layout with plenty of whitespace and add clear call-to-actions for the user to click on. Make your site load quickly and test it regularly on mobile devices.\n\nHeatmaps, scroll maps, and user recordings made with tools like Hotjar can show where people get stuck on your site. Friction could occur with long loading times, confusing menus, missing CTAs, or other similar issues. Solving these can help reduce bounce rates, increase engagement and conversion.\n\n7. Participate in SEO communities\n\nJoining SEO communities isn’t just about asking for help when facing issues; it’s about much more. Platforms like LinkedIn, X, Reddit, Facebook groups, or SEO forums sometimes offer insights and advice you can’t get anywhere else. Sharing wins, failures, and experiments helps you stay connected to the SEO community and lets you build a name for yourself.\n\nThese platforms often surface research, news about Google core updates and warnings about issues some time before becoming common knowledge. News might be shared just early enough for you to take advantage of it before your competitor does. Building relationships can help you get business opportunities, collaborations, or friendships.\n\n8. Optimize for AI discovery\n\nAI tools and chatbots are trained on information from the web, so it’s important to understand how your content is surfaced by large language models (LLMs). These systems, like ChatGPT and Google Gemini, reshape how users uncover information. The results are often served without a way to click to your site. If your brand is not visible in these generated answers, you could be missing out in a growing share of visibility.\n\nResearch your topics and content to see how the system responds to your queries and if your content appears in the answers. Audit your content to see if you structured it so LLMs can understand it. Use clear language, be factual, build your topical authority, and use easy-to-understand layouts. Most of all, be sure that the crawlers of the AI services can reach your site without issues.\n\n9. Focus on content pruning\n\nSometimes, ranking higher isn’t about adding more content to your site; it’s often about cleaning up what you have. Content pruning means removing, merging, or updating poorly performing content. Ancient blog posts that no longer get any traffic, outdated product pages, and thin articles with no value may impact your site’s overall performance.\n\nStart with a content audit using Semrush, Screaming Frog, or Ahrefs. Find pages with limited traffic, few backlinks, and poor engagement. You can update these posts if you have enough insights to add. If they’re no longer relevant, merge them into a single, more authoritative page. If nothing works, delete and redirect. Keep your site lean and focused to improve the overall quality and authority, which also helps you fix keyword cannibalization.\n\n10. Implement structured data markup\n\nPart of SEO is making your site easy for crawlers and search engines to understand. Structured data markup is one of the best ways to tell Google what your pages are about. With the correct schema items, you can highlight things like product prices, event dates, business locations, recipes, and more.\n\nPlugins like Yoast SEO make this process much easier. Start with your most important pages and products, select the proper schema, and fill in the details needed. Once you have the basics done, you can expand it to more complex structured data if needed.\n\n11. Keep focusing on mobile\n\nIf you’ve been living under a rock, you might have missed that today’s world is all about mobile. We’ve been spending more and more hours glued to our mobile phones. So, having a perfect mobile site is no longer an option. Make sure that it adapts to all screen sizes, that the buttons work, and that no nasty pop-ups overlay the screen.\n\nTest your site often in various browsers on Apple and Android devices. See if it offers a great user experience. If not, fix it. Fixing even small accessibility issues or loading performance can greatly impact user satisfaction.\n\n12. Create helpful, people-first content\n\nGoogle is no longer just rewarding keyword-optimized pages, but genuinely helpful, people-first content. Your articles should satisfy user intent by providing clear, trustworthy and actionable information. Instead of writing the same things everyone has already done, create unique content that informs, solves problems, and adds value for your readers.\n\nWhen thinking about your content, ask yourself the questions that Google recommends: “After reading your content, will someone leave feeling they’ve learned enough about a topic to help achieve their goal?” and “Does your content clearly demonstrate first-hand expertise and depth of knowledge?” If your content doesn’t do any of these things, you might need to rethink it. Focus on things you know well, avoid clickbait and write for your readers, not search engines.\n\n13. Optimize for Core Web Vitals\n\nCore Web Vitals gives you a sense of your site’s health, especially with speed, responsiveness, and visual stability. They measure three main things: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), which looks at loading performance. The second is Interaction to Next Paint (INP), which shows how quickly your site responds to user actions. The third one is Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), which checks for unexpected layout shifts when your page loads. Google uses these metrics to determine whether your site gives a good user experience.\n\nYou can monitor your Core Web Vitals in Google PageSpeed Insights, Search Console, or Lighthouse. Improvements you can often make include optimizing images, using faster hosting, reducing reliance on JavaScript, and setting proper dimensions for media. Test your site often to see if your improvements improve the user experience.\n\n14. Diversify content formats\n\nNot everyone wants to read a 2000-word blog post. Some people enjoy graphics, videos, or podcasts. You can quickly repurpose your content in various formats, instead of starting over every time.\n\nDoing so makes your site more interesting for readers and search engines alike. Adding helpful videos to articles or offering downloadable checklists or research reports makes your content more appealing.\n\nIn SEO, change is a constant. There are algorithm updates, new AI features emerge, and best practices change. It’s a lot, so staying up to date with the news is essential. Follow reliable sources like Search Engine Land, Search Engine Roundtable, the Yoast SEO newsletter, or our monthly SEO update to get the needed insights.\n\nPlan some time every week to read up on SEO news. Join the conversation whenever you feel like it. Use the new insights to improve your strategies. Sticking to last year’s strategy will not cut it if your competitors are faster to adapt!\n\n15 SEO tips for 15 years of Yoast\n\nHere’s to 15 years of Yoast and 15 more years of helping the world rank better.

In iOS and Android, you get pop-ups that ask for confirmation when a data USB connection is established before you can actually start transferring data.\n\nHowever, this guard against “juice jacking”—a hacking method in which charging stations are manipulated to inject malicious code, steal information, or allow access to the device when plugged in—is apparently not as secure as expected.\n\nCybersecurity researchers have discovered a serious loophole in this system that can be easily exploited.\n\nA new way to hack smartphones via USB\n\nAs Ars Technica reports, attackers can use a new method called “choice jacking” to ensure that access to smartphones is easily authorized without the user being aware of it.\n\nTo do this, attackers first install a feature on a charging station so that it actually appears as a USB keyboard when connected. Then, via USB Power Delivery, it executes a “USB PD Data Role Swap” to establish a Bluetooth connection, trigger the file transfer consent pop-up, and approve consent while acting as a Bluetooth keyboard.\n\nThe charging station can therefore be used to bypass the protection mechanism on the device, which is actually intended to protect against hack attacks with USB peripherals. In the worst case scenario, hackers could gain access to all files and personal data stored on your smartphone in order to take over accounts.\n\nThe researchers at Graz University of Technology tested this method on devices from various manufacturers, including Samsung, who sells the most smartphones alongside Apple. All tested devices allowed data transfer as long as the screen was unlocked.\n\nNo real solution available for most devices\n\nAlthough smartphone manufacturers are aware of the problem, there still isn’t sufficient protection against choice jacking. Only Apple and Google have implemented a solution, which involves users first entering their PIN or password before they can add a device as a trusted source and start the data transfer. However, other manufacturers have not implemented sufficient protection against such attacks yet.\n\nIf your device has USB debugging enabled, it’s especially at risk because USB debugging can allow attackers to gain access to the system via the Android Debug Bridge and install their own applications, execute files, and generally use a higher access mode.\n\nHow to protect yourself\n\nThe easiest way to protect yourself from choice jacking attacks via USB charging stations is, of course, to never use a public charging station or any charging station that isn’t your own. USB charging stations in high-traffic areas—like airports—are especially dangerous.\n\nIt’s better to use your own power bank when traveling and make sure that your smartphone is always up-to-date with the latest security updates."}

I really enjoy telling you about this one, as someone who needed a new graphics card at the tail end of the pandemic. Reports indicate that mining for Bitcoins (i.e., trying to turn electricity and math into money) is no longer profitable. Cry me a freakin’ river.\n\nThis is a complicated story, but the basic equation is that it now costs more in electricity to “mine” a single Bitcoin than that Bitcoin is currently worth—by a significant margin. Due to the nature of the Bitcoin protocol, which started the better part of two decades ago, it was inevitable that we’d reach this point eventually. The pool of minable Bitcoins shrinks as more are mined, and as that happens, the cryptographic work needed to “find” new ones becomes increasingly harder.\n\nCoinshares, via reporting from Overlclockers.ru and PCGamer, reports that we’re now past that point—well past it, in fact. The math says that mining a new Bitcoin in 2025 costs approximately $137,000 USD in electricity, even if you have the (very expensive) computer power to do it, while that Bitcoin is worth about $95,000 on the open market. Even at its all-time high of over $100,000 earlier this year, and assuming ideal conditions with access to cheap power and hardware, it’s a losing game.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that cryptocurrency is suddenly a failed market, as (arguably) the related NFT space has become. You can still attempt to make money by mining alternative cryptocurrencies, or simply trading in existing currencies and trying to play off the fluctuations. But the days of simply sinking a ton of cash into powerful graphics cards and letting them spin electricity into digital gold appear to be over.\n\nOh, no. Anyway…\n\nPC gamers have plenty of reason to be sour at crypto miners, who gobbled up every powerful graphics card for years in a quest to hop on the cryptocurrency train and subsequently sent GPU prices skyrocketing. The AI industry is the newest target of gamer ire, as it seems to be doing pretty much the same thing, though it’s chasing investor cash instead of trying to make it more directly."}

They’ve become a necessary part of our digital lives, yet they can also be endlessly annoying and overwhelming if not controlled. While Google has grander plans for notifications in Android 16, and it’s about time, many of us need a solution today. I can vouch for one particular app to tame your notification demons. It’s called Buzzkill.\n\nDo you feel overwhelmed by notifications on your Android phone? 399 votes Yes, notifications are a big issue on my phone 23 % Not always; they can be annoying sometimes 38 % Rarely; I've managed to get them under control 21 % No, notifications have never been an issue on my phone 18 %\n\nWhat is Buzzkill, and what does it do?\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nBuzzkill is a premium app I’ve used for several years now that gives me more control over the trills, peeps, and popups that my phone bombards me with throughout the day. At its core, it’s an automation app that relies on the “rules” I create. Think of Buzzkill as a simpler version of Tasker but specifically for notification management. A rule consists of three parts: the app sending the notification, the content of that notification, and the action Buzzkill should undertake. The app then monitors notifications and leaps into action when these criteria are met.\n\nThink of Buzzkill as a simpler version of Tasker but specifically for notifications.\n\nThe heart of the app is its list of actions available to reign in chatty apps, privilege important alerts, or trigger various phone settings. These include simple actions like Dismiss, which automatically clears that notification; Secret, which obfuscates the content of a notification; and Speak, which reads the notification aloud. You can even trigger your device’s flashlight, sound its alarm, or have the app automatically reply to your messages. There are 25 actions available, one of which allows users to trigger a Tasker recipe. So, in theory, there are hundreds of possible actions available.\n\nSure, it may sound a bit convoluted, but Buzzkill makes creating rules extremely simple, even for someone who has never used an automation app. The slick UI plays a pretty significant role in this experience. I especially appreciate its set of ready-made rules. Tap the Explore tab on the bottom bar to access them. You can see a sample of them in the feature image at the top of this article.\n\nThe app could easily be used to perform more drastic measures. You could theoretically kill all notifications within a given period and reproduce them afterward. Alternatively, suppose you’re a member of any chat groups with particularly chatty members. In that case, Buzzkill can lump multiple messages from this app into a single notification, muting subsequent messages. You can even assign a specific notification tone to your contacts or apps. The app’s limits are broad.\n\nHow I use Buzzkill to make my smartphone a calmer place\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nSo, how do I use Buzzkill on my phone? Well, the notifications environment on my phone is a constant work in progress, whether fine-tuning spam-suppressing rules based on keywords, targeting specific WhatsApp groups to suppress, or enhancing the visibility of notifications I overlook. However, I do want to detail the rules I use religiously (I’ve bolded the app, content, and action as outlined above):\n\nSupress Messages spam South Africa has a big problem regarding spam SMSes, whether from marketing companies or service providers. Google Messages lets these messages waltz through without much thought, but Buzzkill allows me to suppress the notification alerts and content. It works brilliantly. The rule: When I get a notification from Messages that contains “Stop” or “Opt” or “Insurance” or “Congratulations” or “Dial” then dismiss immediately.\n\nI never miss a loved one’s message If I’m busy with housework or mashing out articles in my office, I will likely miss an important message from my partner or family. To ensure I receive and, more importantly, hear these, I use Buzzkill to sound a specific notification tone and repeat it every minute until I dismiss it. It’s annoying, but that’s the point. The rule: When I get a notification from WhatsApp that contains my partner’s name during schedule then remind me with default vibration and Disco Toms every 60 seconds until I dismiss it.\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nCopy OTPs and dismiss the notification One-time PINs are annoying, but Buzzkill makes it super easy to copy them to my clipboard, which I can then paste into the relevant field. It can do this automatically using the rule below, dismissing the notification once the process is complete. Notably, I usually only receive these PINs via Messages, but the rule can be tweaked to include multiple trigger words and apps. The rule: When I get a notification from Messages that contains “otp” then copy verification code then Dismiss.\n\nCreating my own news digest Google News loves sending random daily notifications, but many stories are irrelevant or unimportant. I don’t want to completely silence the app, as breaking news alerts are useful, but I ensure that the app is only allowed to send messages once every few hours. This creates a neat news digest and keeps my phone beep-free throughout the day. The rule: When I get a notification from Google News then batch every 2 hours.\n\nYour watch is ready to wear I’ve written about my watch’s embarrassment of notifying me when I’m not wearing it, but at least it sends my phone an alert when it’s done charging. Buzzkill lets me pop an audio and vibration alert onto that, so I always know when my watch is ready to wear.\n\nThe rule: When I get a notification from Galaxy Watch Manager that contains “Watch battery fully charged” then custom alert with default vibration and Beep-Beep.\n\nQuieten noisy WhatsApp groups My apartment block’s WhatsApp group can get particularly talkative during the day, but none of the 10+ messages sent within two minutes are vital to me. In these cases, I use Buzzkill to cool down the alerts and stop my phone from beeping every five seconds for minutes on end. Notably, you can use this rule for any app that abuses your attention. The rule: When I get a notification from WhatsApp that contains my building’s group then cooldown that app for 2 minutes.\n\nManaging notifications is a necessary, recurring chore\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nThese five rules have stemmed the notification flood on my phone, but it’s only the beginning. Buzzkill is useful, but it’s no silver bullet. I constantly revisit my notifications and the rules I’ve set to ensure they are set up most efficiently. Thankfully, the app makes it pretty easy to keep this process going.\n\nThe History tab is among its most valuable facets. From here, I can view all of my previous notifications that passed through my device per hour, today, yesterday, the past week, or the past month. Tapping on a notification lets me create a rule. This shortcut copies the app and notification content details; I only need to select the action. I suggest regularly revisiting the History tab to visualize problem apps and busy hours. It’s invaluable for tweaking other system settings elsewhere on Android, from adjusting Do Not Disturb settings to sleeping individual apps.\n\nOf course, I must again mention that Buzzkill isn’t a free app, but I wouldn’t call it expensive. At $3.99, it’s a steal for the functionality it enables. Android should have integrated notification automation to this extent years ago, but for now, Buzzkill fills that void exceptionally well."}

Writer and director Isaiah Saxon spent years developing “The Legend of Ochi” to be a fantasy adventure that looks and feels like it could take place in one last undiscovered corner of the world, one where the mysterious primate Ochi navigate living on the fringes of human civilization. This required a lot of preparation and planning, collaboration with artists and designers and puppeteers, but also a lot of Wikipedia diving.\n\n“ I’ve become an amateur primatologist through the course of making [the film],” Saxon told IndieWire. “In the larger picture of writing towards these zoological elements, [I’m looking] at everything that’s on the Internet. I’m reading Wikipedia articles about the one venomous primate and how does that actually work? I’m reading about Tarsiers and lemurs and the sociological structures of Bonobos.”\n\nAll of that research eventually coalesced into the Ochi, a species of scavenger primates with a unique, throat-singing ability to communicate with each other and, miraculously, with one human girl (Helena Zengel) who saves a baby from her father (Willem Dafoe) hellbent on eradicating the creatures he sees as monsters.\n\n“ I was like, ‘Let’s invent a primate and then do our best to make it feel real and grounded — but of course also have a dynamic emotional range,” Saxon said. “We grounded the design of them physically, but also their behavior and their language and social structure and all of that. I wanted it to be grounded in like real patterns that we can identify in nature.”\n\nThose grounded patterns then needed to be brought to life. Saxon turned to John Nolan Studios, and every time he had a little bit of development money, pushed the prototypes of the Ochi further. The team studied Stan Winston’s work on apes in “Congo” for both juvenile and adult Ochis. For the baby Ochi at the film’s heart, they also crafted a moveable metal armature for the body, with silicone skin layered over it — years before the project was officially greenlit by A24.\n\nBehind the scenes of “The Legend of Ochi” Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n“[We had] this naked little baby monkey with no facial animatronic that was completely realistic and alive once the five puppeteers were working with it, which just speaks to the ancient nature of puppeteering. We’ve been making shadows on a cave wall for thousands of years and we just accept the movement of the human hand embodied in a character. We believe it,” Saxon said.\n\nBut once Saxon had the $1 million creature budget for an honest-to-goodness Ochi — with fur strategically layered to provide a sense of mass and weight, animatronic face to act alongside the humans, and coloring that would blend into the deep colors and misty fantasy of the landscape — the puppeteering team could really get to work. Robert Tygner, who worked on “Labyrinth” and the Jim Henson “Ninja Turtles,” is the lead puppeteer for the young Ochi, and he gathered a team of five other performers in order to pull off the movement and facial work for it.\n\n“Together they create this unified performance where Rob is on the head, he’s the quarterback, and one person is on each limb. And then the actual animatronics designer, Karl Gallivan, he’s one of the remote controlled operators, and then there’s a second one, and they all have to be completely synced up. Rob is the one to do that,” Saxon said.\n\nBehind the scenes of “The Legend of Ochi” Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nLike any team, the Ochi puppeteers had to practice rigorously in order to create the appearance of single sentient, curious, bug-hungry baby. “We did a performance workshop the moment we were greenlit in London. My production designer Jason Kisvarday and cinematographer Evan Prosofsky and my producers all met in London to go through every single shot and setup that involved the baby Ochi puppet through the whole film in this sort of duct tape and cardboard format to build the ergonomics of what the set needed to be for proper access for the puppeteers,” Saxon said. “Because it really is a holistic magic trick when you try to do these shots.”\n\nThe “Legend of Ochi” is now playing in theaters."}

The latest conversation on the podcast", "fullContent": "The term ‘digital native’ was coined in 2001 to describe young people who grew up surrounded by technology, implying they possess an almost instinctive understanding of digital tools. But how accurate is that label today? Are they truly tech-savvy, or are they simply fluent in using user-friendly devices without a deeper understanding of how they work?\n\nIn our latest podcast episode, we explore this crucial question: does growing up with technology automatically make someone digitally literate, or just digitally dependent?\n\nHost James Robinson (Raspberry Pi Foundation) is joined by colleague Sway Grantham, Anna Lahtinen (Haaga-Helia University), and Nicole O’Connor (Digi Know This) to unpack the complexities of digital skills, access, and education, and to explore how the label of digital native can sometimes hide broader challenges.\n\nThis episode wraps up our three-part mini-series on digital literacy. Each episode builds on the conversations from the latest issue of Hello World magazine, offering expert insight and practical ideas from educators driving real change.\n\nWho are the guests on the podcast, and what will I learn?\n\nWe’ve assembled a panel of expert guests to discuss and debate the concept of the digital native.\n\nAnna Lahtinen, Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences\n\nAnna is an internationally recognised scholar who specialises in the transformative effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on working life, businesses, and careers. In the latest issue of Hello World, Anna and her colleague Antonia O’Connell write about assumptions regarding high digital literacy among youth in the setting of a work environment.\n\nIn the podcast, Anna explains that the term ‘digital native’ can be useful for starting conversations about the skills, access, and confidence people need to navigate technology, particularly in the workplace. However, she warns that the term can be misleading, as it often assumes that young people have strong digital skills, when many struggle with the practical demands of using technology at work.\n\nAnna also highlights the importance of supporting young people to use technology responsibly and develop a healthy relationship with it. As she puts it:\n\n“If we instil the right values in students, that will eventually lead to a healthy relationship with technology and ethical use of new tools in both their work and their lives.”\n\nNicole O’Connor, Digi Know This\n\nNicole O’Connor is a two-time female founder who brings her expertise to improving teaching and learning through innovative EdTech, digital literacy, and accessibility.\n\nIn the podcast, Nicole challenges the idea of the digital native, calling it both problematic and overly simplistic. She explains that the term overlooks important differences, like access, privilege, and levels of exposure to technology, which all shape a person’s digital skills. For Nicole, it’s a “grey area” that proves we can’t assume young people are automatically tech-savvy just because they grew up with devices.\n\nNicole sees digital literacy as a journey, not something people are born with. She compares it to learning a language: while young people may be familiar with technology, they still need to develop deeper skills to become critical thinkers, careful users, and aware of issues like data privacy and online safety. As she puts it:\n\n“They might have had some exposure, but over time they need to learn the skills to be digitally literate… They’re not even close to that.”\n\nListen or watch now\n\nTo hear more, listen to or watch the full episode.\n\nYou can watch or listen to each episode of our podcast on YouTube, or listen via your preferred audio streaming service, whether that’s Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Amazon Music.\n\nYou’ve listened to the podcast, now subscribe to the magazine\n\nWe hope this episode, along with the others in the series, inspires you and helps you to engage your students more in computing.

There are some months you should avoid", "fullContent": "There are many factors that affect the success of a rebrand, but have you ever considered that the timing of a brand refresh could be a factor in whether it cuts through or not?\n\nNew research from Bynder finds that there are clear seasonal patterns in when a company is most likely to announce a rebrand. July, March and February are highlighted as the most popular months to rebrand while September, June and December are the least popular.\n\nIt's worth noting that the methodology here is by no means foolproof. Bynder analysed media mentions of the term 'rebrand' over the past few years, although this doesn't account for articles talking about older rebrands, something we're keen on here on Creative Bloq – take our rebrands of the decade series, for example.\n\nWhy is rebranding seasonal?\n\nManisha Mehta, global PR and communications expert at Bynder, explains one potential reason for the patterns in rebranding:\n\n“July is likely the highest-performing month due to its alignment with fiscal-year planning for global companies and mid-year strategy resets, making it a logical point to refresh a brand ahead of H2 launches or Q3 campaigns,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\"March and February, on the other hand, are often seen as natural windows for brand rollouts tied to annual planning, following the strategic foundation set in January. These months also precede major marketing activations in spring and summer, allowing teams to embed a refreshed identity into wider campaigns.”\n\n\n\nShould you rebrand in quieter months?\n\nBynder suggests that this research might suggest an opportunity for companies to rebrand in the quieter months, though Manisha says there may be good reasons behind the lack of rebrand announcements in these months.\n\n\"December is typically dominated by end-of-year campaigns, reduced stakeholder availability, and customer fatigue, which makes it a riskier month to secure attention for a rebrand.\n\n\n\n\"June often marks a transition period, with decision-makers preparing for summer holidays or fiscal year-end, creating potential delays in execution or reception.\n\n\n\n\"September sees a return to business as usual post-summer, with teams focused on delivery rather than transformation, potentially making it less ideal for introducing large-scale change.\"\n\nThe takeaway\n\nAll in all, it's not as if rebranding in one particular month guarantees success or failure (and these can be tricky to measure), but businesses should ensure they are rebranding intentionally with a strong plan for communicating their new look. If you are rebranding in a busier month, make sure you're willing to compete, and if you're choosing a quieter month then make sure your reasons for doing so are clear. You may be pleased you did.\n\nDo you have experience rebranding in one month over another, do you think it's affected how your rebrand was received, or the amount of press attention it got? Let us know in the comments.\n\nAnd if you're just starting out on your rebranding journey, see our logo design tips and tips for successful brand impact article, as well as the inspiring examples of work that won the Brand Impact Awards 2024."}

To ensure this, periodically verifying that everything’s secure is a wise idea.\n\nHow? Primarily, you’ll want to look over the devices logged into your Facebook account. If someone has stolen or compromised your password, it’s possible that they are lurking in the background. Perhaps a hacker looking for data to use for a scam or extortion, but don’t discount romantic partners, roommates, family, and friends, too.\n\nYou can use a PC or a mobile device to check over the devices logged into your Facebook account. If you spot one you don’t recognize, you can remove it easily—as well as follow up with a password change to protect against future intrusions.\n\nOn a PC\n\nMeta buries this info in its account center.

Don’t wait—the window is closing", "fullContent": "Buying toilet paper got ugly during the early part of COVID—between panic buying and hoarding, shelves were often empty. Due to tariffs, we may soon see similar scarcity for a bigger range of products, and that could include tech gear like PCs. Recently, the biggest port in the U.S. said that by next week, arriving shipments will have declined by 35 percent… and that empty shelves could soon follow in several weeks.\n\nIn an interview with TV news station KTLA, Gene Seroka, the executive director for the Port of Los Angeles, described the anticipated drop and the expectation of layoffs in adjacent industries like trucking and longshoremen.\n\nMore relevant to those of us at home, retailers who’ve spoken with Seroka gave an estimate of about five to seven remaining weeks of usual inventory. (That is, we consumers being able to walk into a store and immediately get what we need or want). After that stock runs out, Seroka predicts a rise in product prices, as well as a decrease in selection for goods. The example given: You might want to buy a blue shirt, but you’ll instead only find one among many purple ones.\n\nDespite the current (but temporary) hold on the higher tariffs for electronics like laptops, the ongoing chaos with these taxes will still likely result in fewer options and higher prices. When I spoke with companies about the effects of tariffs, multiple sources warned of reducing the availability and variety of product lineups, along with potential price increases to cover the new levies. So if you’re on an older Windows 10 PC that can’t make the upgrade to Windows 11, you could end up in a similar situation as the above shirt example—maybe you want a budget laptop for under $500, but all that’s available are $1,200+ models.\n\nOur current favorite cheap laptop currently costs just $280. That likely won’t last through the summer. Raphael Brasileiro / Unsplash\n\nCurrently, one asset management company (Apollo Global) has sketched out a possible timeline for how fast tariffs could lead to empty shelves, as per Investor’s Business Daily. Released on April 27, their scenario has container shipments drying up by mid-May and domestic freight (transportation) by late May, with layoffs in retail and trucking beginning in mid-June. A recession could then follow in the summer.\n\nYou can get a closer look at how this grim outlook is playing out right now in tech through Gamers Nexus’s detailed three-hour video report, which contains extremely transparent interviews with multiple contacts in the industry. To best understand why companies have chosen to stop shipments to the U.S., listen to the section where Hyte discusses the numbers for its Y40 case. The interview with Louis Rossman also explains clearly the impact on small business owners. Peppered throughout the report is the repeated estimate of reduced product availability, downsizing or outright closing, and possible layoffs.\n\nWhile these businesses speak more on components than on fully built PCs or laptops, the challenges posed by the tariffs apply across electronics—including moving manufacturing to the U.S. (a stated goal of these taxes). But as Seroka points out in his KTLA interview, manufacturing brought stateside won’t completely boost the job market—many tasks will be automated and performed by robots.\n\nSo ultimately, what does this mean for anyone in the market for a new PC? You have to make a choice soon about whether to replace an old machine. When asked about retailers, Seroka said that large retailers will be able to hold on to normalcy the longest, as they increased pre- and lower-tariffed shipments to the U.S. in anticipation of higher ones.\n\nMajor retailers will be able to offer normal levels of inventory the longest—but even that will run out in five to seven weeks. Zoshua Colah / Unsplash\n\nSmall- and medium-sized businesses haven’t been warehousing stock to the same degree, so they will have to decide sooner if they’ll bring over product based on the new pricing. But again, even major retailers aren’t expecting to hang on beyond five to seven weeks.\n\nIf you want to stretch your tech further, you do have some options. You can install Linux or, if you have a compatible machine, ChromeOS Flex. You can also buy yourself time by paying $30 to extend Windows 10’s security updates.\n\nBut no matter if you choose to replace, stretch, or extend, you should decide on a plan. Unfortunately, sitting around won’t guarantee any more stability. The potential for additional tariffs on semiconductors still looms, as an example. Currently, China says it hasn’t entered negotiations yet with the U.S. regarding the existing tariffs."}

But then I asked if they had considered asking Chicago to leave their beautiful state and become independent city-state? The answer was one I was not expecting. It seems many in the rural counties have been considering seceding from the state of Illinois. And he further stated that many had considered joining with Missouri. But it also seems that Indiana is actively asking them to join Indiana. Now I have been reading about the Greater Idaho project happening in Oregon, but had not heard anything about Illinois [counties] doing the same thing. Did not know if you had heard of this. If not here is something to look into. Other states as well. My original home, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, many places would love to get out from under the influences of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. After all, that state has had open carry allowed since before I was born. But do not try it in Philadelphia!\n\nI realize you speak about voting with your feet, but many people enjoy where they live except for the politics — my current state, included We joke, sometimes for real, about throwing out the southern end of the state as it is really just an extension of the Northeastern states of the USA.\n\nThank you very much for your very interesting blog.

The neighbor who has giant slash piles spread around his property for bird habitat, burned one of the big piles near my property last weekend displacing the unhoused, and unwanted, rodents onto my property. I was alerted to the squirrels’ presence when a security camera caught one near the container. Upon investigation, I found the entrance and exit hole they had dug into my raised dirt and rock foundation. Needless to say, the traps are set. I set the first traps around 1330 hrs and upon checking them around 2000 hrs, I had already caught one squirrel. I used my favorite bait of peanut butter and melted chocolate chips mixed together.\n\nThe spring and summer garden is in full swing. Our garden, with the exception of a few melons and winter squash, is planted and growing fast with the warm weather we are already having. I am anxiously awaiting the yields of fresh produce. This is the first year we have a fully fenced garden, and tall raised beds. I am really enjoying not having to bend over to weed the garden, or to harvest the food we grow. Because of the depth of our new raised beds, about three feet tall, our winter carrots are longer, bigger and tastier then ever before. It’s wonderful not having to worry about the chickens, or dog, getting into our raised beds and tearing them up. Our fruit orchard looks like it is going to have a bumper crop this year as well. My wife, kids and I are very excited to not only eat the fresh fruit right off the tree, but to also harvest, process and can the literal fruits of our labor. We tend to make a lot of jams and jellies. If we have leftover fruit, we will blanch, pit and can the extra peaches, apricots and pluots for this fall and winter. Each year, we work harder and harder to shop less and less at the grocery store(s) and be more self-reliant.\n\nI am growing concerned about the amount of ammunition law enforcement officials have found during some recent traffic stops that were being transported by Mexican nationals likely linked to the cartels. I am a devout believer that a citizen who is legally and financially able to do so, should be able to own as many firearms and as much ammunition as they want, no questions asked. However, these news reports: Mexican nationals arrested while transporting 180,000 rounds of ammunition from Utah to Colorado and Twice-Deported Man Accused Of Smuggling 18,000 Rounds Of Ammo Skips Court, are extremely disturbing. It appears most of the seized ammunition is .308 Winchester, with the other being listed as 7.62. I have not heard any clarification whether it is 7.62×51 NATO, or 7.62×39, the caliber most notably associated with the AK-47. Regardless, what is that much ammunition, in the hands of nefarious individuals, going to be used for? I believe it is for a well-planned, well-thought-out and constructed, high-casualty event on the US homeland. I believe this event will not just be in the big cities, but everywhere targeting schools, shopping centers, freeways, hospitals, government buildings, and maybe even certain military bases.\n\nI hope and pray that I am wrong, but I believe this large-scale attack is imminent, in the not too far future. Remember, an unknown number of military-aged males came into our country illegally during the previous administration and we still have no idea where most of them are, let alone the judges who keep interfering with deportations.\n\nTrying to think and stay ahead of what I believe is likely to happen and to avoid having to leave our house as much as possible if/when something happens, we have increased the size of our garden for year-round growing/harvesting as well as growing the size and variety of birds in our poultry flock(s). We are also starting to harvest and gather several more cords of firewood to replace what we used this past winter, but also to more thoroughly/tightly fill our shipping container.\n\nAgain, I hope I am wrong. Stay safe and vigilant out there, and keep your powder dry.”\n\no o o\n\nReader WHOINPHX had this comment on the recent article on obtaining Passport Border Crossing Cards:\n\n“The application asks for a Social Security number.

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the press:\n\nI will take this since I just got off the phone with the president about Amazon’s announcement. This is a hostile and political act by Amazon. Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years? And I would also add that it’s not a surprise because as Reuters recently wrote that Amazon has partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm. So this is another reason why Americans should buy American.

It stemmed from China demanding that the company not allow reviews and ratings in China after it sold “a collection of President Xi Jinping’s speeches and writings on its Chinese website about two years ago.” A negative review of the book caused the disruption.\n\nBuried in the article:\n\nIn a core element of this strategy, the internal document and interviews show, Amazon partnered with an arm of China’s propaganda apparatus to create a selling portal on the company’s U.S. site, Amazon.com – a project that came to be known as China Books. The venture – which eventually offered more than 90,000 publications for sale – hasn’t generated significant revenue. But the document shows that it was seen by Amazon as crucial to winning support in China as the company grew its Kindle electronic-book device, cloud-computing and e-commerce businesses. The 2018 briefing document spells out the strategic stakes of the China Books project for Jay Carney, the global head of Amazon’s lobbying and public-policy operations, ahead of a trip he took to Beijing. “Kindle has been operating in China in a policy grey area,” the document stated, and noted that Amazon was having difficulty obtaining a license to sell e-books in the country. “The key element to safeguard” against its license problem with the Chinese government “is the Chinabooks project,” the document stated. The document also noted: “Amazon.com/China books project has also gained wide recognition among Chinese regulators.”\n\nWell, as I said, Amazon piped up after the video of Leavitt went viral.\n\nAmazon Haul sells low price items:\n\nAmazon is considering showing a tariff surcharge on items sold via its site for ultra-discount items, the company confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. The move would affect items sold on Haul, a subsection of Amazon’s site and app that offers apparel, electronics and other goods priced below $20. Haul competes directly with Chinese discount retailers like Temu and Shein, which have surged in popularity in recent years due to their bargain basement prices. “The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store has considered listing import charges on certain products,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. “This was never a consideration for the main Amazon site and nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties.”\n\nDonations tax deductible\n\nto the full extent allowed by law."}

The Senate would then hold a High Court of Impeachment to review evidence and vote to convict or acquit the impeached official.\n\nI have introduced articles of impeachment against President Trump.

He accused the president of the following: Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power, Usurpation of Appropriations Power, Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression, Violation of First Amendment Rights, Creation of an Unlawful Office, Bribery and Corruption and Tyrannical Overreach.\n\n“Donald Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve as president and represents a clear and present danger to our nation’s constitution and our democracy,” Thanedar said. “His unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act.”\n\nHowever, Congress is packed with GOP members, so it’s unlikely that the Republican-filled House of Representatives will unanimously consider the articles of impeachment.\n\nIn response to the articles of impeachment, White House spokesperson Liz Huston insisted in a statement, per Fox News, “Every action taken by President Trump and his administration is fully lawful and firmly rooted in the will of the American people. President Trump is doing exactly what he promised: securing our border, bringing in trillions of dollars in investment to America, and restoring common sense leadership. Meanwhile, Democrats are once again showing where their true priorities lie — siding with illegal immigrants over the safety, security, and well-being of hardworking American citizens. Their desperate impeachment stunt is nothing more than a reckless political act that the American people see right through.”\n\nWho Is Shri Thanedar?\n\nThanedar is a Democrat and a U.S. representative from Michigan’s 13th congressional district. Born and raised in India, he eventually moved to the United States to pursue his PhD at the University of Akron. Thanedar became a U.S. citizen by 1988, and he ran for governor of Michigan in 2018."}

In this article, we’ll share the private equity mindset and show how you can use it to grow your business without extra investment—solving a challenge many companies face in the current economic climate.\n\nChanging your mindset—think like a private equity firm\n\nMost businesses are hardwired with the mindset that you need to spend more to grow more. More on ads, on your website, on a bigger dev team. The list goes on.\n\nPrivate equity firms think differently. First, they analyze performance, looking at what’s working and what isn’t. Then, they cut what isn’t working—the waste—and reinvest the savings into scalable, high-leverage growth levers.\n\nIn other words, they reallocate underperforming budgets into high-ROI activities. You might argue that most businesses think about efficiency gains, but these initiatives are almost always siloed within individual functions… and it’s tough to achieve breakthrough growth by optimizing in isolation.\n\nWhile most businesses optimize within silos, private equity firms optimize across them.\n\nA simple way to apply this approach to your business\n\nIf you’re already spending money on ads, apply the 80:20 principle to your paid media spend. Identify the least effective ads, pause them, and reinvest the savings into a proven, scalable, high-leverage growth lever.\n\nYou could reinvest into your higher-performing ads—but private equity firms tend to aim higher. They look for levers that create lasting value.\n\nThat’s why CRO should be the obvious choice. Unlike ads, CRO creates a permanent lift across all your traffic sources—including the ads you chose to keep running.\n\nHere’s the kicker: Because you’re using money that was previously underutilized, this approach allows you to fund CRO without increasing your budget. It’s essentially CRO for free—self-financed by your underperforming spend.\n\nThe power of this strategy might not seem groundbreaking (or exciting)… until you see the numbers.\n\nThe Private Equity Strategy in action\n\nTo see how this works, let’s revisit InflataFish, our favorite fictional online seller of inflatable fishing boats. As it happens, they’ve just been acquired by Rod & Reel Partners, a fictional private equity firm that’s making big waves in the industry.\n\nAfter acquiring InflataFish, the team at Rod & Reel Partners did exactly what any effective private equity firm would do: they opened the books, followed the money, and started asking uncomfortable questions.\n\nThen they applied a classic private equity move: cutting low-performing spend and reallocating it into high-leverage growth levers. In this case, they redirected an under-performing portion of the paid media budget into a Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) program.\n\nIn a previous article, we described how InflataFish spends $195,000 a month on paid advertising, making $328,500 worth of sales—with a 5% net margin that’s $16,425 of profit each month.\n\nInflataFish decided to reallocate 10%—$19,500—of their monthly advertising budget into a 12-month CRO program (by pausing their worst-performing campaigns).\n\nAs we can see in this graph, the least effective 10% of the budget (the far-right portion) contributes the fewest sales.\n\nSo what happens? Let’s take a look at the results over the next twelve months.\n\nBecause InflataFish are reallocating the least effective portion of the budget, sales don’t dip proportionally to ad spend—they decrease by just 3.5%, or $11,500 per month.\n\nMeanwhile, let’s assume that the CRO program achieved an increase in conversion rate of 50% incrementally over the twelve month period, starting in month three.\n\nMonth Conversion rate 1 1.00% 2 1.00% 3 1.05% 4 1.10% 5 1.15% 6 1.20% 7 1.25% 8 1.30% 9 1.35% 10 1.40% 11 1.45% 12 1.50%\n\nLet’s take a look at how sales compared over the twelve months, versus the “base case” scenario where InflataFish did nothing.\n\nHere’s what happened:\n\nIn month 1, InflataFish spent $19,500 less on paid ads and—because conversion rate is the same—monthly sales dipped by $11,500 (to $317,000).\n\nIn month 2, it was the same story; still no increase in conversion rate and—with the reduced ad spend—monthly sales remained $11,500 down (at $317,000).\n\nIn month 3, the conversion rate increased by 5% to 1.05%, and sales increased by $15,850 to $332,850— already surpassing the monthly sales before starting CRO .\n\n. In month 4, conversion rate increased again to 1.10% and sales accelerated again. They were now $20,200 above the base case and climbing.\n\n…and so on.\n\nSales increase in direct proportion to conversion rate, surpassing the base case sales in month 3. These show impressive gains, but what do we see when we focus on the monthly profit?\n\nThe increase in net profit (including the investment in CRO) is much more dramatic, because the Power Law of CRO is at work. (When your conversion rate increases, your profits grow disproportionately.) For a detailed explanation of this read the Power Law of CRO and our follow-up study, The math behind PPC dominance.\n\nAnd speaking of dramatic, let’s take a look at the cumulative net profit over the period, versus the base case.\n\nThis chart captures the real impact of Rod & Reel Partners’ strategy. At first, profits dip slightly, reflecting reduced sales and the investment in CRO. But by month 4, the breakeven point is reached—the cumulative profit from the reallocation strategy catches up with the “do nothing” scenario. From there, the two paths diverge dramatically. By month 12, the reallocation strategy has outperformed the baseline by 260%, delivering an additional $514,000 in net profit. (Put another way, the cost of not doing CRO would have been over half a million dollars.)\n\nAnd note the slope of the curve heading into Year 2. Even if you stop working on CRO (and somehow survive your CFO’s wrath), the profit gap continues to widen at the same pace—because CRO creates a permanent lift.\n\nHere’s the same chart taken out to Year 3 (remembering that the investment stopped at the end of Year 1):\n\nWe were thinking of showing continued investment in CRO beyond Year 1, but this graph would end up way too tall.\n\nNot all CRO programs are equal\n\nThe figures above model the impact of a 50% increase in conversion rate, achieved over a 12-month period, but what if InflataFish beat that goal, or fell short?\n\nTo find out, we can use sensitivity analysis, re-running the model with a range of conversion rate improvements—10%, 20%, 50%, and 100%—all achieved incrementally over 12 months. The chart below shows the cumulative net profit for each scenario compared to the baseline of doing nothing.\n\nThe results are striking.\n\nEven a modest 10% lift in conversion rate (just a 1% gain per month from months 3 to 12) outperforms the base case—and the gap widens over time. The slope of the 10% line heading into Year 2 shows that profits continue to diverge upward—because the gains are permanent.\n\nAs the conversion rate increases beyond 10%, the strategy’s ROI becomes increasingly transformational. A 20%, 50%, or 100% lift doesn’t just improve profits—it multiplies them, while building a more resilient, scalable funnel. Unlike ads, which stop working the moment you stop paying, CRO delivers lasting improvements across all traffic sources—paid, organic, referral, and more.\n\nIn adopting this approach, InflataFish has moved from chasing growth to driving growth—not with risky bets or budget increases, but with a calculated reallocation of spend into a high-leverage growth lever.\n\nThe result? A step-change in performance. And not an extra cent required.\n\nA practical growth strategy for today’s economic climate\n\nThe relentless pressure to do more with less often seems like a barrier to growth—but does it have to be? Private equity firms don’t think so because they perfected the art of building value without inflating costs.\n\nWhen you move investment from poorly performing areas to high-impact growth levers like CRO, you materially improve your business. The Private Equity Strategy is elegantly simple and extraordinarily powerful.\n\nAnd here’s the best part: You already have everything you need to get started.\n\nWant help modelling this strategy for your business?\n\nBook a free strategy session and one of our consultants will work with you to model the effect of this strategy on your own numbers.

EventBridgeルールに関して意外と忘れがちなのですが、以下のようにバケットの設定で「EventBridgeへイベント送信を行う」をオンにしておかないとルールを作っただけではイベントが通知されませんので注意が必要です また、templateであらかじめ設定をオンにするには以下のように記載します ## S3 Buckets SourceBucket: Type: AWS::S3::Bucket Properties: BucketName: video-frame-splitter-source-bucket NotificationConfiguration: EventBridgeConfiguration: EventBridgeEnabled: true\n\nStepfunctionsについて\n\nワークフロー定義内で、JSONata記法を使用しています。\n\n（ただし本記事ではJSONata自体の詳細説明は省略します）\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/step-functions/latest/dg/transforming-data.html\n\n## Step Functions Express Workflow VideoFrameSplitterStateMachine: Type: AWS::Serverless::StateMachine Properties: Name: video-frame-splitter-sm Type: EXPRESS Role: !GetAtt VideoFrameSplitterStateMachineRole.Arn Definition: StartAt: GetVideoDuration States: GetVideoDuration: Type: Task Resource: !GetAtt VideoFrameSplitterGetVideoDurationFunction.Arn Next: GenerateFrameList QueryLanguage: JSONata Assign: bucket: \"{% $states.result.bucket %}\" key: \"{% $states.result.key %}\" fps: \"{% $states.result.fps %}\" GenerateFrameList: Type: Pass Next: ExtractFrames QueryLanguage: JSONata Output: snapshotTimes: \"{% $range(0, $states.input.duration, 1) %}\" ExtractFrames: Type: Map End: true QueryLanguage: JSONata Items: \"{% $states.input.snapshotTimes %}\" ItemProcessor: StartAt: ExtractFrame States: ExtractFrame: Type: Task Resource: !GetAtt VideoFrameSplitterExtractFrameFunction.Arn End: true QueryLanguage: JSONata Arguments: bucket: \"{% $bucket %}\" key: \"{% $key %}\" second: \"{% $states.input %}\" fps: \"{% $fps %}\"\n\n全ては解説しませんがポイントだけまとめると\n\nbucket,key,fps値を変数に格納し InlineMapのLambda関数内でArgumentsとして使用\n\n1つ目のLambda関数で抽出した動画のduration(秒数)を元にPassステートで配列(snapshotTimes)を作成、たとえば動画が10秒だと以下のようになる [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n\nInlineMapで配列の要素を各関数に渡していくことで1秒ずつLambda関数を起動し、fps枚数分の静止画を保存\n\nという仕組みになっています。\n\n! この仕様の場合、動画が長くなればなるほど起動するLambdaの数も増加します。例えば10分の動画なら600個のLambdaがMapステート内で起動しますが、Express Workflowsの場合はステップ数が増えていけばいくほどStandard(標準)ワークフローよりもコストパフォーマンスがよくなります。なぜならStandardワークフローの場合はステップ数と実行時間に応じて課金されるのに対し、Express Workflowsの場合は実行回数とデータサイズに応じた課金のみで低レイテンシーで大量の処理をこなせるからです。\n\n8秒の動画で検証\n\nまず8秒(正確には7.xxx秒)で30fpsのテスト用動画で検証しました。\n\n約3秒以内にワークフローが終了しています。\n\n8秒 × 30fps = 約240枚のフレームがS3バケットに保存されていることを確認\n\n爆速かつスムーズな処理を体感できました。\n\nちなみに動画の中身はプライベートで撮影した野生のリスが柵から木にジャンプする様子ですがフレームでジャンプシーンを捉えていました！\n\nフレーム分割した静止画\n\n8分の動画で検証\n\n次に8分40秒（520秒）で30fpsの動画でも検証を実施。\n\n結果として、\n\nLambda関数内部でffmpegエラー（exit 228）が発生\n\nエラー内容は「CalledProcessError」\n\nという問題が起こりました。\n\n最初に設定していた\n\nメモリ 1024MB\n\nエフェメラルストレージ: 512MB(デフォルト)\n\nでは /tmp のエフェメラルストレージに動画と静止画を一時ダウンロードするための容量が不足していたことが原因\n\nこの問題への対応策として、\n\nLambdaの エフェメラルストレージ を4096MBに拡張\n\nを4096MBに拡張 Lambdaのメモリサイズも4096MB(4GB)に増加\n\n約1分30秒程度でエラーなくワークフローが終了しました。\n\n\n\n520秒 × 30fps = `約15600枚のフレームがS3バケットに保存されていることを確認\n\n20分の動画で検証\n\n次に約20分（1200秒）で30fpsの動画でも検証を実施。\n\n結果として、状態遷移数800程度で5分を超過し、タイムアウトとなりました。この構成でフレーム分割するのは10分程度の動画が限界ですね\n\nまとめ\n\n今回、Step Functions Express Workflowsを使って動画フレーム分割に取り組みました。\n\nSAM＋レイヤー構成でシンプルに環境構築可能\n\nExpress Workflowsを使用することで10分以下の長尺ではない動画なら一瞬でフレーム分割可能\n\n長尺動画になるとExpress Workflows用途向きではなくStandard Workflows向きでLambdaや他のアーキテクチャ設計が重要\n\nという知見を得ることができました。\n\nStep Functions Express Workflowsは今回のシチュエーションよりさらに大量に状態遷移が必要なリアルタイムデータやストリーム処理にも耐えられるはずです。今回の処理だけでもバッチ処理やデータ処理基盤にも活用できる強力なサービスであることを強く実感しました。"}

It was images like those that prompted Syrdarian to build a jungle temple in real bricks, complete with the bright colors and flowing water that’s so appealing. I’m impressed by how well the mix of tan, peach, and orange shades blends together, and how two shades of azure blue works better than one. The scene suggests the play of light and shadow. The stonework is nicely accented by subtle details, like the wooden scaffolding and a lone duck peeking out from the corner. Syrdarian’s model makes a good case that while AI slop will never replace the work of a master builder, it can still inspire.\n\nRelated"}

Having unsuccessfully tried twice to impeach him, they’re still invested in impeachment.\n\nJust the other day, Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff told a town hall crowd that Trump “has already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment” because of his meme coin contest. Of course, all candidates now offer contests, and Trump hasn’t yet sold access to the Lincoln bedroom, but none of that matters to Democrats.\n\nRep. Shri Thanedar (D. MI) is unimpressed with mere promises of future impeachments. He wants impeachment now. And so he’s acted, introducing in Congress Articles of Impeachment against Trump that list several things that Thandedar thinks justify giving the people’s elected president the boot from the White House. Thanedar’s site summarizes them this way:\n\nThe resolution includes seven articles of impeachment outlining a range of constitutional violations: 1. Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice. 2. Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds. 3. Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations. 4. Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media, and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech. 5. Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (“DOGE”) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution. 6. Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain. 7. Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.\n\nIn other words, Thanedar dislikes Trump’s policies, and someone gave him a bunch of big words to throw around.\n\nIn a pre-modern era, when you disliked the elected president’s policies, you’d work to win back Congress and the White House via genuine democratic processes, such as offering Americans intelligent, viable policies and doing the hard work of door-to-door campaigning. Nowadays, in the Democrat world of “democracy,” it means using threats of violence and the abuse of law and process to destroy a sitting president.\n\nNeedless to say, every one of Thanedar's claims are ludicrous, but I want to focus on the man behind the Articles of Impeachment. For a visual, this is Shri Thanedar:\n\nThe is the Democrat Congressman who’s trying to impeach Trump 🤡 pic.twitter.com/PqlNNteOzr — Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) April 29, 2025\n\nWikipedia (which is always favorable to Dems) has more on him, and it doesn’t paint a pretty picture. Here are my takeaways:\n\nThanedar was born and educated through his Master’s degree in India, coming to America when he was 24 to get a PhD. He’s been an American citizen since 1988.\n\nNot long after, he bought a company called Chemir. By 2005, the company had $16 million in annual revenues and 160 employees. Thanedar borrowed $24 million from Bank of America to buy seven more companies, one of which—Azopharma—grew very big, very fast. Eventually, he was living like a king.\n\nHowever, the recession hit hard, and Bank of America forced Azopharma into bankruptcy. A research facility was closed so abruptly that, per former employees who broke in trying to save them, the beagles inside, in Fauci-esque fashion, were left to starve. Thanedar has denied this.\n\nMeanwhile, Chemir remained profitable so that, when the company sold for $23 million, Thanedar paid off his debt to BofA. He went into business with his son, launching Avomeen Analytical Services, which did well. When Thanedar sold his equity in the company, he made bank, later sharing $1.5 million of the proceeds with 50 employees. (Which was a nice thing to do).\n\nWell, except for the fact that Avomeen’s buyer ended up suing, claiming that Thanedar gave them fraudulent information when he sold the company. Thanedar denied the charges, and the suit was eventually settled.\n\nAccording to Laura Loomer, a tenacious researcher if nothing else, there’ve been other allegations about Thanedar’s business integrity:\n\nNEW:\n\n\n\n🚨 INDIAN DEMOCRAT CONGRESSMAN WHO FILED ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY HAS A HISTORY OF FINANCIAL SCAMS, HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF FRAUD MULTIPLE TIMES IN COURT FILINGS 🚨\n\n\n\nIn 2016, The Detroit News reported on a lawsuit against Shri Thanedar… https://t.co/Ra4w1SSWQx pic.twitter.com/EZg9vpcvhd — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) April 29, 2025 DOGEai, which is an “autonomous AI” algorithm X account (yeah, that’s the world in which we live), chimes in: Thanedar’s campaign drowning in $730K debt while pushing impeachment stunts?

Moreover, it seems that Thanedar, dogged by allegations of business fraud and sleazy financial manipulation, is the last person who should be accusing Trump of wrongdoing.\n\nImage: X screen grab."}

But anniversaries are also a time for royal reporters to get briefed on the state of a royal couple’s marriage. In recent years, there have been many indications that all is not well in the Wales marriage, but both William and Kate seem committed to the idea of remaining married. On Kate’s side, the commitment is more for her ultimate prize, being queen consort. For William, I think the commitment is for maintenance of his image, the happily-married family man who can disappear for weeks and months at a time because he “prioritizes his family.” Well, Becky English at the Mail had an anniversary exclusive about their marriage, how they thought nothing of scheduling a trip to Scotland on their anniversary, and more. Some highlights:\n\nWill & Kate celebrating their anniversary publicly: The fact that they are doing so in a very public setting – with all eyes on their interactions and body language – is unusual for this intensely private couple. And it shows how far they have come together since those testing times in Malaysia and their continued strength as a family unit. It’s important to stress that they hadn’t intended for their anniversary to become a public event. But when the dates came up for this two-day visit to the remote Isles of Mull and Iona and staff realised there would be a clash, William and Kate apparently thought ‘why not?’ Will & Kate love Scotland: Sources tell me it’s impossible to exaggerate their love for Scotland: it has played a unique role in their relationship, given that they met and fell in love at the University of St Andrews, and return to the Highlands each year for family holidays at Balmoral. ‘It’s definitely one of their ‘happy places’,’ one insider says. So it’s a particular delight, sources say, for them to use the occasion to shine a spotlight on resilient island communities, local industries and the need for tourism in the region. A brutal period: Of course it has been a particularly brutal period for them as a couple given Kate’s cancer diagnosis last year. But the experience has, friends say, also given them a greater appreciation of what they have together, including an increased willingness to share more of their private family moments with people (as we have seen in the regular video updates on Kate’s health journey of late). ‘They are as happy as anyone has ever seen them,’ a well-placed source tells me.\n\n\n\nA balanced relationship: Their relationship is far more balanced than many will realise, although the princess notably prefers to focus more on family matters and has taken her time in striking out on projects of her own, such as her Early Years initiative. That’s in part because she has always seen her role as a supportive one, much like the late Duke of Edinburgh was for the Queen. A while back I revealed that the princess had been in frequent contact by letter with Philip for many years before he died in 2021, with the pair enjoying a ‘warm and loving’ relationship. Will & Kate are the very model of collaboration: That should not be to underestimate the princess’s strength of character and strong personal will. Above all, William is her equal partner in everything – not an ‘i’ is dotted or ‘t’ crossed without their joint sign-off and collaboration. ‘He flies off the handle at any sign of Catherine being patronised and stamps that out very quickly,’ a friend once told me. ‘It’s one of his triggers. Over the years, many people have come up with great ideas for her, but if they are put across in a dismissive way, they’ve got pretty short shrift from him.’ A deep intimacy: There is, they say, a ‘deep intimacy’ between the couple, forged through their shared experiences in the public spotlight and William’s admiration for Kate’s abilities as a mother. He particularly appreciates the way she has created a happiness and stability for their family that he didn’t always experience growing up.\n\n[From The Daily Mail]\n\nThis is fascinating: “It’s one of his triggers. Over the years, many people have come up with great ideas for her, but if they are put across in a dismissive way, they’ve got pretty short shrift from him.” First of all, it suggests that William regularly flies off the handle at staffers who suggest projects or patronages for Kate. Second of all, given the “projects” we’ve seen from Kate over the years… those are what William approves of?? Like, he thinks Kate’s Early Years keenery is smart, and he thinks the staffers suggesting the glorified busywork are approaching Kate the right way, as if she’s an idiot child who can only wander around, listening and learning? It also suggests that KP staffers have been frequently “dismissive” of Kate and her work, which… I can actually believe, given the pie charts and business task forces which go nowhere.\n\nAs for all of the royal sources swearing up and down that William and Kate have never been happier… I still say that whatever deal was made last year, it involved a more structured system for Kate’s vacations, holidays and minimal work schedule. As in, the agreement was that Kate barely has to do anything at this point."}

With four games left – Chelsea (A), Arsenal (H), Brighton (A), and Crystal Palace (H) – the Reds, under Arne Slot, now face a different challenge: maintaining intensity whilst managing the squad.\n\nDavid Lynch, speaking to Dave Davis for Anfield Index, offered some fascinating insight into how Slot might approach the remainder of this unforgettable season. It’s clear that, although Liverpool have achieved their primary goal, there’s still a lot to play for in terms of momentum, pride, and future planning.\n\nOpportunity to Lay Down a Marker Against Rivals\n\nOne fixture that jumps off the page is Chelsea away. As David Lynch remarked, “For Liverpool, up against a rival in Chelsea who are also in contention to sign Dean Huijsen then knocking them out of the UEFA Champions League places wouldn’t be so bad.”\n\nSlot knows that a win at Stamford Bridge would not just add to Liverpool’s points tally but also damage a rival’s prospects heading into next season. Lynch highlighted, “Liverpool are a far superior side and it’s a big chance to dent Chelsea’s chances next season.”\n\nEven with the title secured, matches like these are far from dead rubbers. Liverpool’s professionalism and hunger to dominate English football can set the tone for what could be a golden era under Slot’s leadership.\n\nManaging Celebrations and Maintaining Focus\n\nAfter the emotional high of winning the title, there’s always the risk of a drop-off. However, Liverpool’s schedule gives them breathing room to recalibrate. “The good thing is that Liverpool have a clear week to reboot and get back into training after a few days of celebrations,” said Lynch.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the players deserved a moment to bask in their achievements. Yet Slot’s task will be to harness those positive emotions without allowing complacency to creep in. As Lynch put it, “The desire might not be at an all-time high but the quality difference between Liverpool and Chelsea is so obvious, then they’re still more than capable of going there and getting a win.”\n\nSlot’s teams have always played with high energy and tactical discipline. It would be surprising if Liverpool’s standards were allowed to slip, even in matches with ‘less’ at stake.\n\nOpportunities for Fringe Players and Future Planning\n\nSpeculation is rife about how Slot will handle team selection over the final fixtures. Lynch summed it up perfectly: “It’s really tough to know what sort of lineup he is going to go with. Maybe he will put someone like Federico Chiesa in the shop window or give someone like Harvey Elliott the minutes that he deserves.”\n\nLiverpool’s depth has been key this season. Young talents and fringe players could now see more action, but Slot will undoubtedly strike a balance. The aim will be to give opportunities without jeopardising performance.\n\nMoreover, Lynch made an astute observation: “Slot will want a decent points tally, to win as many games as possible and extend the gap between Liverpool and the rest of the league table.” Finishing with over 90 points would not just look impressive; it would underline Liverpool’s dominance and set expectations sky-high for next season.\n\nConclusion: Glory Now, But Eyes on Tomorrow\n\nArne Slot’s Liverpool have already made history. Now, with the pressure lifted, they have a rare chance to play with freedom but also purpose. Every fixture offers an opportunity – whether to develop players, demoralise rivals, or simply continue setting standards.\n\nThanks to David Lynch and Dave Davis of Anfield Index, we’ve had a glimpse behind the curtain of what Liverpool’s mindset might be as they head into these final four matches. It’s clear that under Slot, there is no room for complacency – only the relentless pursuit of excellence."}

Under the guidance of Arne Slot—whose arrival was met with both intrigue and scepticism—Liverpool secured their second Premier League title in style. There were echoes of dominance from seasons past, but also signs of something new, something evolving. It was a day when Anfield felt its pulse quicken again.\n\nSlot, composed and commanding throughout his debut season in England, declared the title was theirs before a ball was even kicked on Sunday. That belief filtered into the team, reflected in every surging run, crisp pass and clinical finish as the Merseysiders delivered a statement victory.\n\nMidfield Engine Powers Liverpool’s Title Charge\n\nCentral to Liverpool’s success this campaign has been a midfield that marries technical excellence with relentless work rate. For former Watford captain Troy Deeney, it’s the heart of the Slot revolution.\n\n“When you look at the midfield, his [Slot’s] whole season has been encapsulated by that midfield three,” Deeney told TalkSport. “Ryan Gravenberch has been fantastic, he’s one of two players to play every game, and then there’s Alexis Mac Allister, who for £40m now looks like he could be worth £400m.”\n\nDeeney’s valuation isn’t mere hyperbole. Mac Allister has grown into one of the most complete midfielders in Europe, dictating tempo, intercepting danger, and scoring goals that define seasons. His curling effort against Tottenham—an elegant strike that fizzed past the outstretched Guglielmo Vicario—summed up both his poise and purpose.\n\nMac Allister Compared to Club Legends\n\nThere are few compliments weightier at Liverpool than being compared to Steven Gerrard. Yet Jamie Redknapp went there, hailing Mac Allister’s influence in the title-clinching performance.\n\nIndeed, the Argentine’s contributions have extended beyond statistics. He has been the glue between defence and attack, the calming presence when nerves frayed, and the spark when Liverpool needed ignition. In a season defined by adaptation—new manager, new system, new dynamics—Mac Allister has not only survived; he has excelled.\n\nAt 26, his ceiling remains dauntingly high. Reports of Real Madrid’s interest are hardly surprising. What’s striking is that such attention feels justified. The price tag may sound fanciful to some, but in an inflated market where potential is often paid for in advance, £400m feels less like exaggeration and more like recognition of proven, elite impact.\n\nLiverpool’s Next Chapter Has Its Pillars\n\nWhile Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk may still claim the marquee awards, Mac Allister’s name belongs in the conversation. His seamless adjustment into a deeper midfield role—often alongside the tireless Gravenberch—has elevated both himself and Liverpool.\n\nSlot’s style, more surgical than emotional, demands intelligence as much as industry. Mac Allister provides both in abundance. He reads the game like a veteran, executes like a technician, and inspires like a leader.\n\nThis season wasn’t just about reclaiming a title—it was about establishing the future. Liverpool have found a pillar in Mac Allister. If £400m sounds bold, consider what’s next."}

This was more than just a victory – it was vindication, jubilation, and long-awaited celebration all rolled into one. For a fanbase denied its moment in 2020 due to lockdown restrictions, Anfield finally became the scene of wild, deserved rejoicing.\n\nFrom Mohamed Salah’s goalscoring brilliance to Virgil van Dijk’s defensive composure, this title win had its stars. Yet as the champagne corks popped and medals were handed out, one man shifted the spotlight away from the obvious. Andy Robertson, never one to seek headlines himself, chose instead to highlight those in the shadows – the unsung heroes.\n\nSquad Depth Defines Champions\n\n“It’s the lads that train so hard week in week out without maybe getting the rewards at the weekend,” said Robertson, speaking to Stadium Astro post-match. His words offered a sharp insight into what fuels championship-winning squads: not just the matchday starters, but those who support them in silence.\n\nWataru Endo, Harvey Elliott, and Jarell Quansah – three players who rarely grabbed headlines this season – were namechecked for their professionalism, dedication, and readiness. “You look at Wataru coming on, Harvey coming on, Jarell, all these lads, they’re always ready to contribute to the team and you can’t take that for granted,” Robertson added.\n\nTheir roles, though limited in minutes, have been vital. Whether it was pressing in training or injecting energy off the bench, these players helped push the standards inside the club. That drive, Robertson believes, is what separated Liverpool from the rest. “If you don’t have a good squad with a good attitude you’ll never win anything,” he emphasised. “Credit to those lads because I know it’s been difficult for them but they’ve managed to stay with us and this win’s as much for them as the likes of Virgil who haven’t missed a game all season.”\n\nDepth Now, Decisions Later\n\nThe trio’s limited playing time – just two Premier League starts between them – has prompted speculation. Elliott is attracting interest from Bournemouth, Quansah from Newcastle, and Endo may return to the Bundesliga. With Arne Slot now overseeing Liverpool’s next steps, decisions will need to be made about how the squad is reshaped.\n\nBut Robertson’s rallying cry serves as a caution. Letting such dependable squad players leave may not seem like a major loss, but history has shown Liverpool’s campaigns can falter without depth. Injuries, fixture congestion, or loss of form can derail title hopes unless players like Endo, Elliott, and Quansah are ready to slot in.\n\nRobertson’s Message Resonates\n\nThe Scotland captain also paid tribute to those working behind the scenes. “All the people in the background have been working tirelessly – the physios, the masseurs, the doctors, the kitchen staff,” he said. Their efforts, largely invisible to fans, form the backbone of elite football success.\n\nThis was not just a night for stars and statistics. It was a tribute to team spirit. Robertson’s praise for unsung heroes wasn’t lip service – it was a reminder of what truly underpins Liverpool’s rise. Talent is celebrated, but attitude is essential. In the heat of the title race, it’s often the quiet contributors who tip the balance."}

In a season laced with steel, style, and surging belief, Arne Slot’s men delivered a fitting finale, thumping Tottenham Hotspur 5-1 to clinch the 2024/25 title. It was a performance that combined emotional depth with attacking brilliance, and it secured the one point they needed — though they barely settled for that.\n\nSlot’s side fell behind early to Ange Postecoglou’s visitors but roared back in vintage Liverpool fashion, unleashing a ferocious response to seal the title with style in front of a raucous home crowd. The scenes were euphoric, the message emphatic: Liverpool are back on top.\n\nLiverpool Join United in Title Tally\n\nIn capturing this crown, Liverpool have now equalled Manchester United’s record of 20 top-flight titles — a symbolic moment in English football history. This isn’t just another league title; it’s a restoration of dominance.\n\nArne Slot, in his maiden campaign at the helm, becomes only the fifth manager to win the Premier League in their debut season. He joins a select group and, in doing so, honours the legacy of his predecessor, Jurgen Klopp.\n\nSlot Pays Tribute to Klopp\n\nKlopp was the only Liverpool boss before Slot to lift the Premier League trophy. He had bid farewell to Anfield less than a year ago, passing the torch with dignity and affection. In his final game, Klopp welcomed Slot with a song — a gesture now returned with feeling.\n\n“It feels great. I don’t think I want to say a lot. The only thing now is to send my appreciation to Jurgen Klopp,” Slot told LFCTV post-match. Then, in a moment soaked in emotion, he led a chorus of Klopp’s farewell tune — switching the lyrics from ‘Arne Slot’ to ‘Jurgen Klopp’.\n\nKlopp Reacts to Liverpool’s Latest Triumph\n\nFrom afar, Klopp watched with pride. His foundation, his fingerprints, are still all over this Liverpool team — from the pressing DNA to the passion on the pitch. And he made his joy known, sending a heartfelt message via Instagram:\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Jürgen Klopp (@kloppo)\n\n“Super grateful for the past, super, super happy about the present, extremely positive about the future!”\n\n“Congratulations – YNWA.\n\n“Thank You Luv ❤️”\n\nThe German is expected to be in the city for the LFC Foundation’s Gala Ball on 23 May and may well grace Anfield once more when Liverpool face Crystal Palace in their season finale.\n\nIt would be a fitting curtain call — not just for this glorious campaign, but for the man who reignited Liverpool’s fire and helped lay the foundations for Slot’s success."}

Despite needing just a point, Arne Slot’s side played with purpose, hunger, and a title-winning swagger rarely matched this season.\n\nFormer Red Dominic Solanke gave Spurs the early lead, but it was quickly cancelled out by Luis Díaz. The Colombian restored parity before Alexis Mac Allister smashed in a thunderous left-footed effort from outside the area, fed by Ryan Gravenberch. Cody Gakpo’s smart finish from inside the box gave Liverpool a 3-1 advantage before the break. Mohamed Salah added a fourth, and a Destiny Udogie own goal rounded off the rout.\n\nIt was a performance soaked in conviction and clarity—Liverpool’s 80th league goal this term underlines the attacking threat Slot has cultivated in his debut campaign.\n\nControversy Clouds Cody Gakpo’s Celebration\n\nBut amid the celebrations came controversy. Shortly after scoring Liverpool’s third, Gakpo lifted his jersey to reveal the religious message: “I belong to Jesus.”\n\nThe celebration evoked memories of Kaka’s Champions League final moment in 2007—ironically also against Liverpool—when the Brazilian revealed the same slogan while wearing AC Milan colours in Athens.\n\nThough Gakpo received a yellow card for removing his shirt, The Telegraph reports that the FA may issue further sanctions due to the religious nature of the slogan.\n\nFA Rules Leave Little Room for Expression\n\nAccording to Law 4 of the International Football Association Board’s rulebook:\n\n“Equipment must not have any political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images. Players must not reveal undergarments that show political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturer’s logo.”\n\nThe FA’s stance remains firm, with previous incidents punished under the same guidelines. Gakpo’s case is unlikely to be treated differently, regardless of sentiment behind the statement.\n\nBigger Picture for Gakpo and Liverpool\n\nThis may prove a minor storm in an otherwise golden weekend, but it adds a layer of unwanted distraction. For a club basking in its Premier League triumph, headlines about possible FA punishment feel like an unwelcome hangover. Liverpool, ever media-savvy, will likely work to ensure the spotlight remains on their on-pitch success.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool fans, this should’ve been a week of unfiltered joy. Winning the title with such flair and dominance is what dreams are made of. But Cody Gakpo’s well-intentioned celebration might risk casting a shadow over an otherwise flawless afternoon.\n\nThere’s no doubting Gakpo’s sincerity—his faith is a part of who he is. “I belong to Jesus” isn’t offensive, and for many it’s even uplifting. But rules are rules, and the FA’s regulations on slogans—be they political, religious or personal—are crystal clear. It’s a grey area emotionally, but not legally.\n\nSlot’s Liverpool have cultivated discipline on the pitch, and moments like this—though harmless in spirit—could become a distraction. What if this leads to a ban or fine just as we push towards more silverware or head into pre-season preparations?\n\nFans are right to ask whether common sense can be applied in situations like this, but precedent suggests otherwise. This isn’t about religious bias—it’s about uniform enforcement of the law. Still, it’s hard not to feel a little frustrated that in a sport fuelled by passion and belief, a moment of personal expression is being scrutinised so harshly.\n\nGakpo’s goals and character are beyond reproach. Let’s hope the FA show understanding—because while the laws of the game matter, so too does the human element that makes football so powerful."}

However, as Merseyside celebrates, focus has already turned towards securing the future of one of the club’s most crucial players — Ibrahima Konaté.\n\nCredit to Paul Joyce of The Times for highlighting the growing urgency at Anfield regarding Konaté’s stalled contract negotiations. His future could shape Liverpool’s defensive stability for seasons to come.\n\nOutstanding Campaign Makes Konaté Invaluable\n\nThere is little doubt about Konaté’s importance to Slot’s high-achieving side. Featuring in 26 league matches, the 25-year-old French international finally enjoyed an injury-free season, forming a formidable partnership with Virgil van Dijk.\n\nStatistically, Konaté’s contribution has been outstanding:\n\nPass Completion %: 90.5% (81st percentile)\n\nAssists per 90: 0.06 (86th percentile)\n\nAerials Won: 2.58 per 90 minutes (76th percentile)\n\nSuch consistency has earned him plaudits across England and Europe. As Paul Joyce notes, “Liverpool want him to commit, as Van Dijk and Salah have done, and the chance to win more silverware should be tempting for a player who has been linked with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain.”\n\nThe reality is clear: losing Konaté would not just mean replacing a key defender but disrupting the cohesion that propelled Liverpool to their 20th top-flight title.\n\nContract Talks Stall Despite Strong Intentions\n\nWhen Fabrizio Romano initially reported in October 2024 that a contract extension was “fully expected,” few predicted any complications. Yet, six months on, talks have reportedly stalled over wage demands, with Konaté’s camp seeking around £200,000 a week.\n\nPaul Joyce writes, “While the futures of Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold have been sub-plots to the season, Konaté is also entering the final year of his contract.”\n\nThe lack of progress has been surprising, given Konaté’s desire for silverware and Liverpool’s clear ambition under Slot. His comments after the title clinch revealed little: “New deal? This is a conversation with the club, and we will see.”\n\nThis uncertainty has naturally triggered interest from heavyweights like Real Madrid and PSG, who are monitoring developments closely.\n\nSlot’s Project Requires Defensive Continuity\n\nSlot’s project thrives on structure, discipline, and tactical bravery. For these principles to succeed long-term, defensive continuity is critical. Konaté, at 25, sits at the perfect intersection of experience and potential.\n\nWith Virgil van Dijk edging into his mid-thirties, Liverpool cannot afford to let Konaté drift into the final year of his deal without resolution. Doing so risks a repeat of drawn-out sagas that could destabilise the squad’s focus.\n\nThe importance of Konaté’s contract resolution cannot be overstated. Liverpool must act decisively — not just to protect their immediate interests but to lay the foundations for an era of sustained success under Arne Slot.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a Liverpool fan’s perspective, this report should be seen with both concern and optimism. Yes, it’s alarming that contract talks with Konaté have stalled after such an incredible season. Losing him would weaken our backline considerably, especially when Virgil van Dijk’s best years are realistically behind him.\n\nHowever, the key takeaway is that Liverpool want him to stay — and that matters. Arne Slot has already shown he can persuade players to buy into his vision, as seen with the extensions of Salah and Van Dijk. Konaté has just won his first Premier League title in dominant fashion; it’s hard to imagine he would walk away from a project only getting stronger.\n\nReal Madrid and PSG will always circle players like sharks, but Liverpool’s project is now as exciting as any in Europe. If Konaté is motivated by silverware and legendary status, staying at Anfield is the obvious choice.\n\nFans should trust the process. Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes, overseeing football operations, have handled much trickier negotiations in the past. Konaté will hopefully see where his future truly lies — and that’s lifting more trophies in red."}

Signed in the summer of 2023 for a modest £35 million, the Argentine World Cup winner has justified every penny and more, becoming an irreplaceable pillar of Arne Slot’s midfield. In what feels like the culmination of a remarkable transformation, Mac Allister has played a pivotal role in propelling Liverpool to the summit of English football.\n\nSpeaking on The Daily Red podcast from Anfield Index, Dave Hendrick perfectly captured the feeling sweeping through the fanbase: Liverpool have not just won the league, they have done so emphatically. “We needed one point, we took three, and now it is confirmed – your beloved Reds have won the league,” he said, reflecting on the 5-1 mauling of Tottenham Hotspur that sealed the title. Hendrick, like many, admitted the achievement hadn’t yet fully sunk in: “It hasn’t hit home yet. Maybe it has for you; it hasn’t for me.”\n\nLiverpool’s Dominance Written in Red\n\nThroughout the campaign, Liverpool have been relentless. Hendrick underlined the gulf between the Reds and their rivals, noting that “we are 15 points clear” with four matches remaining and even daring to dream that “there is a world in which we win this title by 20 points.” A staggering possibility, and one that speaks to the sheer dominance Liverpool have displayed under Slot’s guidance.\n\nThe figures are breathtaking: 25 wins from 34 games, 80 goals scored, and only two defeats all season. Hendrick pointed out that “nobody can doubt what this team has done,” highlighting the incredible achievement of going on a 26-match unbeaten run. Amidst the statistical supremacy, it is Alexis Mac Allister who has emerged as Liverpool’s midfield general, a player whose influence has grown immeasurably throughout the season.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister: Football’s Bargain of The Century\n\nWhen Liverpool secured the services of Mac Allister, there was optimism, but few could have predicted the immediate and profound impact he would have. In a summer where rivals splurged astronomical fees on midfielders, Liverpool moved early and wisely. Hendrick was emphatic: “What a ridiculously good footballer we got for £35 million. That is one of the great bargains in the modern Premier League.”\n\nThe contrast is stark. Hendrick pointed out the vast sums spent elsewhere: “Declan Rice, £105 million. Enzo Fernandez, £115 million. Moises Caicedo, £111 million.” Against that backdrop, Mac Allister’s fee looks laughably low. And unlike others weighed down by their price tags, Liverpool’s No.10 has thrived under expectation.\n\nIt was fitting that on the day Liverpool confirmed their latest championship, it was Mac Allister who produced a moment of pure brilliance. Hendrick recounted how Gravenberch’s stolen ball allowed it to run free to Mac Allister, who “takes a touch to get it out of his feet and hammers it home from the edge of the box on his left foot.” It wasn’t just a goal; it was a statement. This wasn’t a functional midfielder doing a job – it was an outrageously talented footballer stamping his authority on the occasion.\n\nChampion Mentality and Captain-in-Waiting\n\nBeyond the goals and assists, it is Mac Allister’s temperament and leadership that have truly set him apart this season. Hendrick didn’t hold back in his praise, insisting: “Whatever he’s asked to do, he does it to the highest level. He’s got a flawless temperament. His mentality is exactly what you want.”\n\nThere’s a growing belief among many supporters, and certainly with Hendrick, that Mac Allister should one day wear the captain’s armband. “I think he’s the next captain,” he said unequivocally. Given his combination of technical excellence, football intelligence, and fierce competitiveness – as seen when he was “going around crunching lads with tackles” even after scoring his wondergoal – it is hard to argue.\n\nMac Allister’s season cannot be measured by statistics alone. While he has contributed vital goals and assists, it’s his consistency across different roles that has made him indispensable. Hendrick called him “easily the best midfielder in the league this season,” a view that will find few detractors after the campaign he has just delivered.\n\nBest Since Gerrard?\n\nIn Liverpool’s storied history of midfield greats, comparisons to Steven Gerrard are often deemed sacrosanct. Yet Hendrick provocatively posed the question: “Is he the best midfielder since Steven Gerrard?” His answer was nuanced, acknowledging that while “the answer is no” because of Thiago Alcântara’s brilliance, it is also “yes” because Thiago “didn’t play enough.” Mac Allister, by contrast, has not only played but dominated.\n\nIt’s a poignant thought, especially when Hendrick reminded listeners that exactly eleven years ago, Liverpool’s title hopes slipped away against Chelsea, with Gerrard’s infamous fall. How times have changed. Now, Liverpool are champions once more, and Mac Allister has been central to that revival – a symbol of resilience, talent and hope.\n\nLiverpool have come a long way since those dark days. Hendrick reflected on the transformation, from being “hammered by Stoke” to now “winning our second Premier League title” and celebrating “an incredible 10 years.”\n\nAs fans prepare to flood the streets in celebration later this month, they will not just be saluting the legends like Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk. They will be raising their voices for Alexis Mac Allister – a £35 million bargain who, in one glorious season, has etched his name into Liverpool’s pantheon of champions."}

After notching the fourth goal in a title-clinching performance at Anfield, the Egyptian star made his way toward the roaring Kop, borrowed a phone from a Liverpool staff member, and snapped a selfie with the jubilant crowd behind him.\n\nIt was a gesture drenched in symbolism. Liverpool had just sealed the Premier League crown under new manager Arne Slot, and Salah—so often the protagonist in Anfield drama—was again at the centre of the story. Yet, while fans revelled in the joy, others wondered if the moment had been stage-managed.\n\nMohamed Salah Kop Selfie Print A3, A4 or A5 from only £9 FREE UK + Fast Worldwide Shippinghttps://t.co/hgaHkp8wLq pic.twitter.com/3JaRpPorXa — AnfieldIndex (@AnfieldIndex) April 28, 2025\n\nMarketing or Moment of Magic?\n\nThe phone Salah used was a Google Pixel, one of Liverpool’s commercial partners. That led to speculation over whether the celebration was spontaneous or crafted for brand exposure. The image, posted by Salah and the club across social channels, swiftly went viral—garnering millions of likes and views.\n\n“At the beginning of the season I always take selfies with players [who score], so for this one I said ‘OK, I have to think of something special because it’s a picture that’s going to be there forever’,” Salah told BBC Sport. That quote, offering context to the gesture, suggested personal sentiment rather than corporate choreography.\n\nSalah, 32, is no stranger to the lens. His social media is littered with selfies, often alongside team-mates. When he signed his recent two-year contract extension, the announcement came complete with a self-taken photo—adding consistency to his image-driven persona.\n\nControversy and Clarification\n\nInitially, some believed Salah had taken a fan’s phone. It was later confirmed the device belonged to a staff member stationed behind the advertising hoardings near the Kop. That didn’t stop murmurs questioning the authenticity of the act.\n\nSome observers saw it as a cleverly executed marketing ploy. Others were quick to defend it. After all, how could anyone know Salah would be the one to score? It was his 33rd goal of a typically prolific season, but still—none of the earlier scorers had reached for a phone.\n\nGoogle Pixel later posted more of Salah’s post-match selfies, reinforcing the brand connection. And while the FA has regulations on kit advertising and betting promotion, nothing currently prohibits actions like this, even if they edge into advertising territory.\n\nCelebrations Under Scrutiny\n\nReferee Thomas Bramall could have penalised Salah for delaying the restart, but chose to show discretion. Meanwhile, team-mate Cody Gakpo was less fortunate, receiving a yellow card for revealing an ‘I belong to Jesus’ shirt after scoring Liverpool’s third.\n\nSalah’s selfie may be unprecedented in its timing and context—but it isn’t the first. Francesco Totti famously took a selfie after scoring for Roma in the 2015 derby against Lazio, while Mario Balotelli grabbed headlines with a similar move during his time at Marseille.\n\nStill, in a season filled with turning points, Salah’s snapshot might be the image that lingers longest. Not just for its spectacle, but for what it symbolised—Liverpool back on top, and their talisman at the heart of it once again."}

With Arne Slot now at the helm, conversations are already swirling around the future of key players — none more so than Luis Díaz, who have been linked with a move away from Anfield this summer.\n\nIn a revealing interview with Dave Davis for Anfield Index, respected journalist David Lynch provided critical insight into Díaz’s situation. While speculation around player exits always follows a title win, the case of Díaz is particularly fascinating, as it touches not only on Liverpool’s financial strategy but also the need for squad stability.\n\nLiverpool’s Selling Strategy Isn’t What It Used to Be\n\nSpeaking to Anfield Index, David Lynch made a significant point:\n\n“I just wonder whether they would prefer to not renew him because I don’t think Liverpool are as reliant on generating sales through first-team players as people think.”\n\nIt’s a thought-provoking angle. Under previous regimes, Liverpool’s transfer model heavily depended on selling big to buy big. Think Philippe Coutinho’s move to Barcelona funding a spree that included Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker. But today, the club is in a healthier financial position. Winning the league so convincingly underlines that Liverpool’s focus is now on sustained success rather than constant rebuilding.\n\nThis shift in strategy arguably gives Liverpool a luxury they haven’t always had — the ability to retain valuable assets like Díaz without feeling pressured into a sale.\n\nExits Already Looming in the Forward Line\n\nAnother point Lynch raised during his conversation with Anfield Index is the imminent departures within Liverpool’s attacking ranks.\n\n“I already expect Federico Chiesa to leave and Darwin Nunez is expected to leave too, so that’s already two forwards leaving this summer.”\n\nWhile Federico Chiesa’s name being linked is certainly intriguing — and would represent a huge loss if finalised — the more significant note for Liverpool fans is Darwin Núñez’s expected departure. Despite flashes of brilliance, Núñez has struggled for consistency, and a fresh start may suit both parties.\n\nHowever, Lynch adds a crucial warning:\n\n“If you’re already losing those two and you lose a third player that has scored goals this season and has performed well, then that would be a blow.”\n\nLiverpool’s success this season has come from a potent, multi-faceted attack. Losing three forwards could destabilise that, risking the team’s momentum under Arne Slot’s new leadership.\n\nContinuity Could Be Key to Next Season’s Success\n\nIn light of these potential exits, Lynch’s advice sounds all the more critical:\n\n“The ideal situation for Liverpool would be to keep hold of Diaz for one more season because he’s not earning huge money and if they can get one more year out of him and then make the sale, then that would be ideal.”\n\nThe logic here is hard to argue with. The 17-goal forward, still offering quality performances without demanding astronomical wages, can provide that bridge of continuity. His presence would ease the transition for any incoming forward — particularly if Liverpool are investing in a younger or less Premier League-proven attacker.\n\nAs Lynch succinctly puts it,\n\n“It just gives them that extra continuity in the forward line and keeping Diaz could help the new striker that is expected to come in.”\n\nFinal Thoughts: Pragmatism and Patience\n\nLiverpool’s title-winning season was built not just on moments of brilliance but on shrewd squad management and tactical flexibility. As Arne Slot begins his reign, the importance of maintaining some stability cannot be overstated.\n\nLuis Díaz may not stay forever, and there will inevitably be a time to cash in if the right offer comes. But right now, Liverpool need his flair, his work rate, and his experience as they embark on another title defence. Letting him go this summer would feel like an unnecessary gamble, particularly given the other exits already in motion.\n\nCredit must go to David Lynch and Dave Davis of Anfield Index for shedding real light on this developing story — one that will surely define Liverpool’s early months under Slot."}

Yet amid the celebration, Ibrahima Konate sought stillness — a solitary reflection that speaks louder than any roar.\n\n“I remember when we won the Carabao Cup last season at Wembley, it was amazing, but this one was more special because it’s the Premier League,” Konate told Liverpool FC, his words resonating with the weight of the moment. In an empty Anfield, he sat among the seats usually occupied by 60,000 voices, now silent, allowing the enormity of the achievement to wash over him.\n\nA Dream Realised for Konate\n\nKonate’s description of his experience touches something rare and poignant. “After the game I walked into the stadium and just sat in the stand to feel like a fan and I don’t have words to describe what I felt,” he reflected. In a career often measured by medals and milestones, it was a reminder that football’s truest rewards are emotional, deeply human.\n\nHe added: “I said to my brother, ‘I want to see how it is to sit in the stand if I watch a game,’ and I tried to act like a fan, but the stadium was empty. I just wanted to enjoy the moment on my own.” Konate, usually the towering figure battling in defence, allowed himself to be simply Ibrahima — the boyhood fan, the dreamer, now living the dream.\n\nIt is fitting that he became the first French player in Liverpool’s history to lift the Premier League title. “Since I was young, I watched this league every week, every game, and now to win it is crazy. I’m the first French player from Liverpool to lift it. Unbelievable.”\n\nLiverpool’s Road to Glory\n\nWhile Konate’s personal journey was a highlight, Liverpool’s collective story this season under Arne Slot has been equally stirring. Transition, challenge, and expectation were all overcome, with the team producing football rich in spirit and substance.\n\nKonate’s contribution, particularly in the defensive resilience that underpinned Slot’s tactics, cannot be understated. His 28 appearances in the campaign were hallmarked by physical dominance, composure on the ball, and, above all, a commitment to the cause that matched the passion in the stands.\n\nFuture Written in Red\n\nAs Konate aptly put it: “The last day of the season will be more special as we will lift the trophy.” That day will crown not just a campaign of excellence but also a new era under Slot, rooted in familiar Liverpool principles: unity, heart, and humility.\n\nIn choosing to sit alone in the stands after the title was won, Konate did more than just celebrate. He reminded every supporter what Liverpool Football Club is truly about — savouring the journey, cherishing the triumphs, and always feeling connected to the soul of the game.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool supporters, Konate’s quiet moment captured the very essence of what it means to wear the Liverbird on your chest. It is not just about the titles, the goals, or the moments under the bright lights — it is about the connection, the history, and the deep emotional bond to the club.\n\nSeeing a player, especially one who has fought so hard this season, sit among empty Anfield seats just to feel the victory as a fan would, is everything. It shows that no matter how professional and polished modern football becomes, the heart of the game remains raw and real.\n\nKonate’s pride in being the first Frenchman to lift the Premier League title for Liverpool speaks volumes, too. It was never just about adding silverware. It was about making history, fulfilling childhood dreams, and creating memories that will echo for generations.\n\nThis title, and this moment, belonged to everyone — players, fans, staff, and even those watching from afar. And with players like Konate living and feeling it as deeply as we do, the future under Arne Slot looks not just promising but deeply, authentically Liverpool."}

The article read: \"Badenoch is not so much dragging the party down, as she's where a party gets to when it reaches rock bottom.\" It described her as \"unpopular and dislikeable and demonstrably no sort of electoral asset to the party\". And it added that: \"The Tory Party has not come to terms with its defeat last year, nor with the 14 years which preceded it... We are in massive trouble and are not solving our problems because we're not admitting to them.\" Earlier this week, Badenoch rejected claims there was a rift between her and Jenrick over whether the party should form an electoral pact with Reform UK."}

Photo: Dustin Chambers/Reuters\n\nOne of Donald Trump’s dubious first-term accomplishments was becoming just the third president to be formally impeached and the first to be impeached twice (yes, his second impeachment by the House happened a week before he left office, even though his trial and acquittal by the Senate occurred when he was an ex-president). Now, there’s growing talk among congressional Democrats that a third impeachment may be in order if the Democratic Party flips control of the House in 2026, thus putting it in position to consider such a step (a chamber controlled by Trump’s vassal Mike Johnson is less likely to entertain an impeachment resolution than to petition Canada to make the U.S. its 11th province).\n\nMichigan Democrat Shri Thanedar recently introduced new articles of impeachment against Trump, the first of his second term. Thanedar is a House incumbent fighting to head off progressive primary opposition in a heavily Democratic Detroit district, so this sort of gesture is to be expected. It’s more interesting that Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia has publicly said impeachment should be on the table if Democrats flip the House. Ossoff won in his red-leaning state by an eyelash in a January 2021 general-election runoff and is considered highly vulnerable as he runs for a second term in 2026, particularly if term-limited Republican governor Brian Kemp takes him on. He should have no significant primary opposition and doesn’t really need to do anything to cleave the Democratic base to his campaign. If Ossoff thinks support for impeaching Trump may be a good general-election issue in Georgia, that is eyebrow-raising to say the least.\n\nIf, however, you compare what Trump was impeached for earlier with what he has already done in 2025, the case for a third impeachment looks pretty strong.\n\nThe first impeachment, in December 2019, concerned a complex case involving both Trump’s thinly veiled effort to ensnare Ukrainian president Vlodymyr Zelenskyy in a scheme to accuse Joe Biden of corruption and Trump’s obstruction of congressional inquiries into the incident. There were legitimate questions as to whether his misconduct met the constitutional threshold of “high crimes and misdemeanors,” even though his tendency to court the appearance of impropriety made sanctions unavoidable.\n\nThe second impeachment followed the Capitol Riot of January 6, 2021, and was vastly less complicated; the misconduct in question was precisely the sort of thing (an attempted insurrection) the Founders had in mind when providing for impeachments. But some factual questions lingered about the extent to which Trump had ordered the attack on the Capitol and whether it was even possible to hold an impeachment trial for someone no longer in office.\n\nTrump’s 2025 abuses of power, lawless actions against his perceived enemies, and unconstitutional power grabs are as wide-ranging as the Ukraine brouhaha was narrow. And there is zero doubt about the president’s responsibility for these outrages since most of them stem from executive orders he signed. So it was easy for Thanedar to come up with quite a list of draft articles:\n\n1. Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice. 2. Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds. 3. Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations. 4. Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media, and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech. 5. Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (“DOGE”) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution. 6. Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain. 7. Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.\n\nThis seventh article is a bit of a catchall, but there’s plenty of meat on the rest of the bones. And Team Trump is taking the threat seriously enough that it’s reportedly “war-gaming” an impeachment defense on grounds that otherwise it could distract from everything else the administration is doing. It’s also more than possible that Republicans would use the threat of an impeachment to mobilize the MAGA base for the 2026 midterms; otherwise, there are major concerns about GOP turnout in an election without Trump on the ballot. The tactic worked for former president Bill Clinton back in 1998, when Democrats pulled off the rare feat of making midterm House gains while controlling the White House thanks to an impending GOP impeachment bid. Nothing would please Trump more than to play the victim of partisan persecution again despite his total control of the federal government and his own incredible levels of vituperative action and rhetoric.\n\nIn the end, of course, even if Democrats do control the House in 2027, they have to decide whether it’s worth the trouble to impeach Trump a third time knowing that he will almost certainly be acquitted yet again owing to the two-thirds requirement for conviction in Senate impeachment trials. Odds are they’ll try to hold Trump accountable even though he’ll escape conviction. It’s not like he will quietly adopt the role of a lame duck before being evicted from the White House at the end of his final term."}

If you asked me at the start of the calendar year if I'd expect to see modern Linux distributions shipping with working HDR display support in H1'2025, I would have been doubtful. But after a lot of miraculous work that landed across numerous upstream repositories over the past two months or so, everything has come together just in time for the likes of Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora Workstation 42. There still are apps not supporting HDR and the like, but the core infrastructure is in place and working. The past two weeks I've begun testing out the Linux HDR desktop experience with the ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG27UCDM 27-inch 4K display. Between the ASUS PG27UCDM's QD-OLED display and HDR support enabled under Linux, it delivers a very beautiful Linux desktop experience.\n\nEver since the Wayland color management and HDR protocol support was merged in February, there's been an almost constant flow of new open-source projects/applications, Wayland compositors, and other software squaring away their support for high dynamic range on Linux. Among the many recent accomplishments were GNOME 48 with HDR support, Wayland HDR support for the MPV media player, Mesa Vulkan WSI for color management merged, SDL 3.2.6 with HDR color management on Wayland, HDR fixes in DXVK-NVAPI, wlroots color management seeing its initial enablement, and numerous other milestones.\n\nOn the likes of Fedora Workstation 42 and Ubuntu 25.04, when using a HDR capable display it can be easily enabled but then from there it depends upon the application/game level support. It's not a perfect situation yet though with Mozilla Firefox for example not enabling HDR support by default yet: on Firefox 137 is the \"gfx.wayland.hdr\" configuration option. Using Steam Play also still requires going through the Gamescope compositor for the moment until Steam Play with an updated Proton lands native Wayland support. Hopefully that comes soon as for now it's otherwise a nuisance going through Gamescope if you typically aren't using it on your system. Plus countless random open-source applications that are not yet adapted for HDR usage.\n\nHDR on the Linux desktop is also a Wayland-only affair. When it comes to enabling HDR usage on Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora Workstation 42 while trying a few different systems with the ASUS PG27UCDM monitor, the only unexpected issue I ran into was not realizing I had accidentally logged into an X11 session by mistake and then wondering why the HDR options did not appear for either KDE Plasma or GNOME Shell. Once realizing the wrong session and switching over to Wayland, that lone show-stopper was worked around. But if you are a devoted X11 user, there is no HDR display support nor have I seen any activity in that direction.\n\nSo for H1'2025, we are at a stage that certainly exceeded by expectations for where I figured we'd be before the middle of the year. Hopefully though by the time of Ubuntu 25.10, Fedora Workstation 43, and other autumn 2025 Linux distributions the HDR support on the Linux desktop will be much better polished: native Proton / Steam Play support without needing Gamescope, Firefox support by default, and more and more applications supporting it. Due to these factors, unless you are in a pressing need to upgrade your monitor right now, it may be better to wait until latwr in the year for this Linux HDR support to mature and be more broadly supported -- plus allowing time for new monitors to come to market and helping depress the prices on existing HDR displays.\n\nFor those considering a HDR capable display, the ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG27UCDM is a beautiful option. The ASUS PG27UCDM is 27-inch, 3840 x 2160 with QD-OLED panel capable of 240Hz refresh rate, and supports HDR as well as being compatible with G-SYNC and FreeSync. The ASUS PG27UCDM supports DisplayPort 2.1a UHBR20 , there is USB-C display support with USB-C power delivery for those wanting to connect a laptop.

Cheon/Pohang University of Science and Technology\n\nS. Cheon/Pohang University of Science and Technology ×\n\nIn so-called spintronic devices, which have applications in communications and computing, information is encoded in patterns formed by electron spins. For efficient device operation, these spin patterns typically need to be manipulated using electric currents. Such electrical control has been demonstrated for certain spin patterns but not for helix-shaped ones, which have potentially useful features including chirality and collective dynamics. Now Je-Geun Park at Seoul National University, South Korea, and his colleagues have achieved electrical control of helical spin patterns and uncovered the mechanism behind this control [1].\n\nFirst, the researchers considered the helical spin pattern that is naturally hosted by a Ni 1/3 NbS 2 material in which nickel atoms are inserted between layers of niobium disulfide. This material is a van der Waals antiferromagnet, meaning that it is held together by weak van der Waals forces and that adjacent electron spins align in an antiparallel manner. Then, in experiments, the team found that applying an electric current to this material caused the helical pattern to rotate and adopt a different quantum state. This state was detected by measuring a change in the material’s resistance and other electronic properties.\n\nIn numerical simulations, the researchers showed that the spin current induced by the applied electric current transferred its angular momentum to the spins in the helical spin pattern, causing them to rotate collectively through an effect known as spin–orbit torque. The team says that, beyond the implications for spintronic devices, these findings improve our understanding of spin dynamics in van der Waals antiferromagnets.\n\n–Ryan Wilkinson\n\nRyan Wilkinson is a Corresponding Editor for Physics Magazine based in Durham, UK.\n\nReferences et al., “Current-driven collective control of helical spin texture in van der Waals antiferromagnet,” K.-X.

We’ll show you all the ways you can enjoy the bounty.\n\nYou can access the Roku Channel via a web browser or via Roku’s mobile apps for Android and iOS. To watch on a smart TV or another brand of streaming device (an Amazon Fire TV, Google TV, Samsung smart TV), you’ll need to install the Roku Channel app from that device’s app store.\n\nUnfortunately, Roku doesn’t have a version of the Roku Channel app for LG smart TVs or the Apple TV streamer. But we’ll show you some workarounds for those platforms later.\n\nIf you do want a Roku streamer, we’ll help you find the right one.\n\nYou don’t need a Roku-powered streaming device or TV to watch the free entertainment on the Roku Channel; in fact, you don’t need a media streamer at all. Just point your web browser to theRokuChannel.com and pick what you want to watch. Michael Brown/Foundry\n\nWhat’s available on the Roku Channel?\n\nThe Roku Channel offers a wide array of FAST (free ad-supported TV) channels, movies and TV series you can watch on demand, as well as live linear TV (movies and shows are streamed on a fixed schedule—as in the good ol’ days of broadcast television—but you can drop in whenever you want).\n\nYou’ll find some of this same content on other FAST services, such as Pluto and Tubi, but Roku always has a selection of popular films and shows that are exclusive to the Roku Channel. Roku’s most high-profile original project so far is the Emmy-winning Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, starring Daniel Radcliffe as the satirical singer.\n\nRoku offers a small amount of its own original programming, including Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, starring Daniel Radcliffe. Jared Newman / Foundry\n\nOther original shows include The Great American Baking Show, Honest Renovations, and Visionaries: The Arch Project with Keanu Reeves. It’s a tiny catalog when compared to what’s streaming on Max or Netflix, but you can watch all these shows for free (with ads).\n\nRoku has also gone bargain hunting, picking up worthy projects other streaming services have dropped. That includes the entire library of Quibi, the failed “quick bites” short form video service that Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg (former chief executive of Disney and co-founder of Dreamworks), designed for phones.\n\nRoku rescued an entire library of Quibi shows like Die Hart with Kevin Hart, Most Dangerous Game, a Punk’d revival with Chance the Rapper, the Reno 911! revival, and Bill Burr Presents Immoral Compass. Roku also picked up The Spiderwick Chronicles TV series from Disney+.\n\nRoku acquired the entire Quibi library of short films and offers it for free on the Roku Channel. Quibi\n\nSince The Roku Channel was designed as a hub for Roku streaming devices, there’s a lot of emphasis on luring users to subscribe to other streaming services, such as Prime Video, Peacock, MGM+, and Paramount+. If you’re not familiar with the catalogs of those streaming services, you might find yourself routed to their apps or websites when you click on a title.\n\nIf you are interested in subscribing to those services, it’s best to sign up for them directly, so that your customer relationship is with the service provider and not a go-between.\n\nHow to use a browser to watch the Roku Channel\n\nFirst, point your browser to therokuchannel.com. You’ll see a large grid with thumbnail images of the movies and TV shows on offer. At the risk of contradicting everything I’ve said about this entertainment being free and ad supported; well, some of it—a little of it—isn’t. But the Roku Channel user interface makes it easy to tell the difference.Roku’s browser view makes it easy to identify which content is free with ads and which requires a subscription to one service or another. Each section features tiles that slide to the left or right with arrows on each side of the screen, much like the navigation on Netflix.\n\nYou’ll need to scroll down three times to see the entire user interface when viewing the Roku Channel in a web browser on an iPhone. Michael Brown/Foundry\n\nWhat you can’t do is adjust the view of the page to hide the Premium Subscription content. That makes sense—for Roku, at least—because part of the company’s business model revolves around you subscribing to outside services from within its site, for which Roku collects a commission. But it would be nice if users could hide the subscription options they don’t plan to use.\n\nA Browse tab allows a viewer to focus on such categories as Roku Originals, Movies, Series, Comedy, Drama, Western, and dozens of others. You can click a + button next to a program’s description to add it to a Saved tab.\n\nThe Live TV tab shows what’s streaming now with the same sliding tile interface the rest of The Roku Channel site uses. It’s a bit counterintuitive for anyone who grew up with the traditional cable guide grid interface that Pluto and Tubi use for their live TV offerings.\n\nHow to use the Roku Channel mobile app\n\nThe Roku Channel lives inside the Roku app for iOS and Android. That app is primarily designed to act as a remote for a Roku device or Roku-powered television, so you’ll need to get used to working around that capability if you’re primarily using the app to just watch the Roku Channel.\n\nThere is no Roku Channel app for the Apple TV streaming box, but you can play the service on your phone and cast it to the box connected your big-screen TV via Apple AirPlay. Michael Brown/Foundry\n\nFor example, I use an Apple TV streamer with a TCL television that happens to have the Roku software built in. I don’t use the Roku software on the television, but I do have a Roku account. Press the wrong icon on the screen, and the Roku interface launches on the TV screen. There’s no way to turn that off or eliminate the icons for apps you may have installed on a Roku device or television.\n\nThe mobile app uses the same sliding tile interface as the web version, but it’s far more difficult to use on a smaller screen. There’s no way to get an overview of what’s streaming live, and it’s impossible to surface a list of Roku Originals if you’re looking to focus on movies and shows exclusive to the channel.\n\nIf you own an Apple TV, you can watch The Roku Channel on your television screen via mirroring. There’s no support for AirPlay. That means you won’t have access to anything but the streaming video when watching.\n\nWhat’s the best way to watch the Roku Channel?\n\nIf have a Google-, Amazon Fire- or Roku-powered streaming device or television, download the Roku Channel app for your respective device, as that’s the easiest way to watch the service, as you’ll be able to use a remote control. If you don’t have one of those devices, the easiest way to watch the Roku Channel is on a web browser on a computer or tablet.\n\nIf you’re looking to use your mobile device and want to have access to the full catalog of movies and shows, your best bet is to log in via a web browser and add what you want to your Save List. That content will then be easily accessed on the mobile app.\n\nFree streaming has become a major player in home entertainment. If you’re willing to put up with a few commercials (and sometimes the same commercials playing during every single ad break), there’s a wide variety of classic and relatively new movies and shows available on the Roku Channel—and other FAST services—to pass the time."}

The seed part is Airplane Door in White, a tricky part indeed.\n\nTim is a TBB legend whose stellar Star Wars creations have made him one of our most featured builders for well over a decade (not that we’re taking sides!).

Bousker steps into the game with a perfectly staged shoe store scene that features at least 30 uses of the door by my count. There are so many clever techniques on display, from high heels and sandles where the seed piece makes up the majority of the model, to the ingenious pair of Converse All Stars with the doors sunken into the brown shelf so that only a strip appears for the rubber sole.\n\nWe’ll be back to cover the results of this latest battle, but for now be sure to follow the Iron Builders instagram to see the builds as they come in, complete with the playful and pun-filled trash-talking that the event is known for.\n\nRelated"}

They are changing underneath us faster than any human can adapt, and charging us for the privilege. Maintaining control of these robots feels like an impossible mission. Today I’ll share some battle-tested techniques that you can use to rein in your AI agents, chats, and other tools.\n\nThis article is part of my AI Library. If you’re new to agentic coding, start with License to Kill. To dig deep into why and how this stuff works the way it does, check out Something from Nothing.\n\nYour Mission\n\nAfter many successes and failures I’ve had with AI agents, the mission comes down to careful planning and restraining the context of what your agents can do.\n\nEverything that can be done wrong, I’ve done wrong.\n\nIf you can set the right guidelines, agents can deliver better results. Everything than can be done wrong, I’ve done wrong and learned from it. It should be no surprise that agents write software this way. Humans do, too, and that’s where agents get their ideas.\n\nChoosing Your Tools Choosing What to Work On Finding a Route Making a Plan Revising the Plan Testing the Plan Finding Bigger Problems Making Rules Performance Payback Choosing Models Cost Controls Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n\nFair Warning: All screenshots and UI mentions are likely to be outdated by the time you read this, owing to how fast these tools change. The concepts will be there in different parts of the app if you hunt around.\n\nWheatfield with Crows is my favorite Van Gogh painting. It’s stunning in person and can’t be reproduced in any medium. Oil paint impasto reflects photons into your eye in ways that aren’t duplicated by ink on paper or by emissive screens. In the same way, the materials and techniques in your existing code and your prompts determine the true qualities of the finished app.\n\n1. Tools Are Not Materials, Nor Technique\n\nChoosing Your Tools\n\nI’m putting this issue here not because it’s the most important but because folks think it is. In art, there is a great difference between tools, materials, and technique. When the work is done, only the materials remain, transformed as they were by your tools and technique.\n\nWhen you work with AI tools, the materials are your inputs — your code, diagrams, data, and prompts. The technique is how you weave these materials together and the order in which you present them. You’ll find a recurring theme throughout this article: the quality of the materials you provide will be the single most important factor in your AI agent’s success.\n\nMy examples will be from Cursor but I want to emphasize that the tool du jour has very little impact on what you can do, just like all washing machines have similar functions but different buttons.\n\nAI tools change daily. If you haven’t updated yours today, it’s probably behind. The trick is to find the tool that offers a workflow that you like — one that offers a balance of investigation and action and boosts your own workflow.\n\nYou can apply everything I’ll talk about in Cursor with tools like Windsurf, Copilot for VS Code, or even by pasting stuff into ChatGPT or Google Gemini. You can also use all of these tools for free but, as with everything in life, the paid version is significantly better, so don’t judge the paid version of something by the free results.\n\nWill non-devs create high quality output with these tools? Absolutely not.\n\nIt’s also important to know your tool deeply and keep up with its changelog and documentation. I know no one reads that anymore but, ironically, in the age of “ask an AI anything,” the user of such an AI would do well to read the doc directly as the true secrets of its power are revealed only in the pages of those cryptic tomes.\n\nKnow Thyself\n\nWhen working with AI, you must be realistic about your own abilities and shortcomings, for they will permeate everything the agent builds for you. When is it time to investigate, and when is the time to take action? You have to be the one to know and control that flow.\n\nWith AI tools, different skills pay the bills. Does that mean that non-devs (or non-artists) will create high quality output with these tools? Absolutely not. It means just the opposite.\n\nIn addition to your standard set of coding skills, you’ll need deep architectural insights and an ability to communicate them in plain English. That’s not a skill set that’s common among programmers. Don’t be upset at the LLM when its output is just as bad as your input.\n\nRoland’s new V-Stage, shown here with music legend Patrice Rushen of Forget Me Nots fame, reminds me of how far pianos have come. Did you know that the keyboard we have today wasn’t standardized at first? Prior to the adoption of equal temperament tuning, the musician before you might have composed their piece with entirely different frequencies than yours. Talk about bad vibes.\n\n2. Bad Vibes\n\nChoosing What to Work On\n\nYou might notice a heavy emphasis on planning in the topics I’ve picked for this article. That’s because, with agents, 90% of your work is going to be planning. The popular term “vibe coding” suggests that you can just ask for anything or say anything and get results. What’s shocking about this idea is that it’s true.\n\nVibe coding is the exact wrong approach unless you only want an artifact to show someone.\n\nToday’s models have progressed far enough to literally write anything. And that’s now a problem, as I covered extensively in my last article. Vibe coding is the exact wrong approach unless you only want an artifact to show someone.\n\nIf you’re making code that’s expected to ship, you can only think of vibe outputs as prototypes. They look great but, like paper airplanes, don’t really fly. That doesn’t mean they’re not useful. The “M” in LLM means model. It was always a model all along. If we keep that in mind, we can use the model only where we need it, while we control building the final product.\n\nWe need to make a reusable plan for things we only plan to do once. That seems insane.\n\nIt may seem like the amount of planning I’m suggesting will take longer than just writing something shippable yourself. And that’s very likely to be true. The difference is that we get a reusable plan out of this process, something we are not likely to have around for any other kind of code we wrote ourselves.\n\nHere I reference both a file to work on and a reusable plan, written previously (by Cursor, of course!). Notice that it is better able to follow a plan like this than just trying to complete the same actions from the original prompt that created the plan.\n\nWe need to make a reusable plan for things we only plan to do once. That seems insane. Why would it need to be reusable if we’re only doing it once? There are two reasons. The most glaring is that the agent is unlikely to do it all correctly the first time. If your plan isn’t written with multiple runs in mind, you’ll waste time backtracking and re-explaining the plan instead of just nuking your repo and changing the plan, then re-running it.\n\nIf you’re not sure if the plan will work, the agent won’t be sure either.\n\nIf writing a reusable, runnable thing that outputs data and a UI sounds a lot like programming, Welcome to the New Age. The second benefit of this reusable plan (that lives in your repo) is that you or the agent can read it again when you want to refactor or extend your design.\n\nWith this in mind, it’s important to carefully scope your work. Don’t ask for the finish line at the beginning. Try to divide the work you ask for into modular parts that can be completed successfully. If you’re not sure they can be completed successfully, send the agent back to the investigation phase to improve the plan.\n\nIf you’re not sure if the plan will work, the agent won’t be sure either. Agents that lack confidence in their own plans tend to go wildly off track, a recurring theme in recent Mission Impossible movies, now that I think about it. AI agents will make up a solution on-the-fly if your plan doesn’t adequately cover a situation. This is a side effect of having been trained on every kind of code. The agent thinks, “I’ve got it! I have a solution!”\n\nThe more steps your solution requires, the less likely the agent is to be able to make up a missing step. It will invent one that could break other areas of your app or appear to work in prototype but fall apart in practice. You must plan for only small, deliverable steps.\n\nThe outstanding narrative game Road 96 uses randomness to create different interactions for you, the player character, based on the stories of the game’s seven NPCs. All of the NPCs are going the same place but by different routes. These interactions result in new objects and skills that you retain. In the same way, you must choose actions, questions, and answers that are appropriate for each AI model to get to the finish line — and keep those artifacts around for future use.\n\n3. The Road Less Traveled\n\nFinding a Route\n\nOnce you’ve selected your agent’s target, you must also a find a route for it to travel. This seems laborious, too, and always elicits cries of, “But if I have to do that, I might as well code it myself!”\n\nSometimes that’s true. If a change is so small that you could just make it immediately, then you should make it. If a change requires so much explanation that you are having trouble explaining it, your code needs architectural help (much more on this later).\n\nThe agent is not following any “rules” no matter how many ways we try to pretend that it is.\n\nYou will find that procedures that seem very simple to a person, like “Take the third item off of there and do something to it,” cause serious problems for LLMs. Simple console operations like copying files or running builds are also problematic.\n\nTo understand why, we need to adjust our expectations. The agent is not following any “rules” no matter how many ways we try to pretend that it is. It’s merely predicting the next most likely piece of text to output from whatever series of prompts it has in the thread at the moment.\n\nIt’s exhilarating to watch an agent code a feature out of thin air and then go play with it minutes later. It can lull us into a false sense of security where we start asking for things we shouldn’t ask for — things we should do ourselves. We see one great miracle and then ask for a small one in the same codebase, not realizing we are on an agent high.\n\nIf you’re not sure how to implement it, that’s fine — just ask the agent. The more you reference your own code and data, the better the answer will be.\n\nYou should probably try it at least once with something inconsequential just to have the resulting crash. If you try vibe coding something you plan to keep, be prepared to spend precious hours or days rescuing the beautiful baby you created together because you’re in love with your “progress.” Your rescue will involve combing through the agent’s code and your existing code to find out how and why it came to be.\n\nThus, I would recommend that you begin at the beginning and ensure that you know exactly how to implement the thing you’re asking for. If you’re not sure how to implement it, that’s fine — just ask the agent. Put it in “planning” or “asking” mode first or just say, “I’d like to understand how…,” or “I’m trying to understand the implications of…” The more programmer-speak you use in your question, referencing your own code and data, the better the answer will be.\n\nStar Trek was already in reruns when I was born in 1968. My mother didn’t let us watch it because it was “too scary.” The series premise, to go where no man has gone before, certainly implies risk, and Kirk was quick to make a plan and communicate it before anyone teleported to a new planet or ship. You, too, must quickly make and revise plans in this new AI space.\n\n4. Where No Man Has Gone Before\n\nMaking a Plan\n\nIt would be great if we could just make the plan in one step. It’s like asking to learn to play the piano in one step. You’ll get better with time as you realize the problems with agentic coding stem mostly from your poor plans and your bad code, rather than from bad models or broken tools.\n\nSome people will not be able to admit this. Developers are famously bad at communicating with other humans, yet this is exactly the #2 skill that agentic coding requires (#1 still being regular programming).\n\nOften programmers live in a world of “Well, it worked when I tested it locally,” and we won’t want to fess-up to architectural nightmares or implementation problems in our own codebase, which we don’t normally show anyone.\n\nIn this earliest part of the conversation about a new plan, the model suggested some things and I hated all of them, but some pushback from me and some manually-coded architectural changes before I asked the agent to “just do it” resulted in a very different and very clean technique of pure editable JSON files for the metadata so that it can be separated from any individual game and injected at build time. The agent’s suggestions didn’t take into account that JS-based solutions don’t show up for social shares like Discord or Slack, which don't run JS and would wind up with only the template metadata.\n\nThus we arrive at the new programming language, some mash-up of English and pseudocode, brimming with arcane references to your own existing app and its files, functions, and data structures.\n\nTools like Cursor that let you @mention these parts of your code do an even better job with plans than tools that just use a typing or cut-and-paste (or even file upload) interface.\n\nPlans Are First Class Citizens\n\nIn my repos now, a /plans folder is a first-class citizen. I start every new complex request with asking Cursor to write a plan and put it in my-plan-for-this.md , a Markdown file in that folder.\n\nBy saving these with the repo commits, they become usable programs that I can run later by @mentioning them. I can even start a new thread (and often do) by mentioning a plan by name, then asking for revisions or asking to take a single step inside it while I retain control of the repo. I make constant commits with clear messages about which plans have been written or changed and which steps have been run.\n\nWe’ve heard the term “code as doc” and here it is in practice.\n\nPlans are runnable programs. Written in Markdown. That contain real code and data. And get saved in your repo. With plan-related commits and messages.\n\nWhew! This concept of developing, revising, and saving your own plans is far more important than trying to download someone else’s plans or rules file, despite the fact that hundreds of those appeared overnight on the web.\n\nYou can get a book about renovation from Home Depot but that book doesn’t have a plan for your house. The same is true here.\n\nLook inside a plan and you’ll see what enables the magic. They are light years beyond what a person would write.\n\nBy letting a tool like Cursor create its own plans, we gain fascinating insights into how the app crafts its own prompts — the ones that are actually fed to a model. We know it’s prompts all the way down. When you write a prompt in the chat box that references a plan you made, the contents of that plan are attached to the prompt. That’s the sum total of the magic.\n\nHere you can see the actual plan I had Cursor write, along with the interactive chat window while it was being composed. Notice the level of detail and markdown formatting which humans wouldn’t take the time to add. This is very helpful when you want to edit or run these plans. Also notice that Cursor wants to be updated (bottom left), like always!\n\nBut look inside one of these files and you’ll see what enables the magic. Its plans are light years beyond what a person would write. They’re fully commented, described with narrative text, full of examples in real JSON or TS (in my app — yours will be in your languages), and use abundant Markdown formatting to make them both machine readable and pretty when you look at them in an IDE preview pane.\n\nWhen was the last time we had code/doc like that? Remember, these plans are runnable software which you invoke by saying, “Let’s go ahead and do step 2 in @world-domination-plan.md . When you change the plan, commit your repo with a human-readable comment. When you run a step, commit again and comment that you “ran step 2” or something similar.\n\nYou will need these commit breadcrumbs when you later want to roll-back something or look at ideas from old plans you’ve since changed or removed. Often old plans contain juicy bits that we might want to look at later — things where the AI’s inventiveness or clever problem solving might be useful after all, even if the way it describes isn’t implementable in the code you have now.\n\nChappell Roan’s Pink Pony Club is arresting enough and it‘s already mass market. No wonder Momma screamed when she saw it. An AI agent will plan and do things that seem just as off-the-rails and that comes from their mass exposure to other people’s programming, which weighs more heavily on the training set than your code or your prompts — unless you specifically tell it otherwise.\n\n5. Pink Pony Club\n\nRevising the Plan\n\nAs soon as your plan is written into the Markdown file, it will be wrong. That’s all the time it takes!\n\nShould this be frustrating? That depends. Yes, it’s irritating to see it go off the rails here in the plan, before we even get started. It’s not very comforting and doesn’t bode well for actually executing on the plan. We start to scream, “God, what have you done!” when it wants to be a Pink Pony girl.\n\nTo make this work, you have to find out if the finished product with the correct architecture and design takes less time overall using this process than with pure manual coding (or even just autocomplete). An individual step like revising the plan seems annoying because we didn’t have to do that before. Of course, the only reason we didn’t have to do it before is that there was no plan before.\n\nIt’s unhelpful to lecture the LLM about what’s wrong because you are just adding more context to something that falls apart the more context you give it.\n\nWe all code stuff out of our heads. If we write doc, it’s mostly after we coded something. If we try to write doc before code, it’s also wrong immediately because the code deviates from the plan in practice.\n\nIn this closeup from one of my plans, you can see that they actually contain real example code like CSS, TS, and JSON. You can use this ability to avoid having to say where or what to copy from when doing a repeated step. Ask Cursor to take your example (from wherever it is, like one that works) and include it in the plan. This comprehensive plan, hundreds of lines long, took several revisions to get right.\n\nDon’t be starstruck when you see the new plan. It looks so complete, so professional, how could it be wrong? Trust me. It’s wrong. You really need to read all of it. If there are simple things wrong, like whole sections that shouldn’t be there, just yank them yourself. Don’t yell at your spouse that they should have taken out the trash. Just dump it.\n\nIt’s unhelpful to lecture the LLM about what’s wrong because you are just adding more context to a prompt chain that falls apart the more context you give it. Having said that, if there are changes across the plan, like widespread implications, data formats, techniques, etc. that are wrong, you don’t need to re-write those. Just tell the model to change the plan and why and let it go through the whole thing again, making all the necessary updates. Then read it again.\n\nYou’ll be impressed when you craft your first plan that looks right. Then you’ll run it…\n\nWhen you first start writing plans, you’ll likely need more than two revision steps before you even run it. You are learning a new style of programming. When I loaded cassettes into the ADAM and tried to edit them, they often didn’t work the first time. You’ll be impressed when you craft your first plan that looks like it’s right, down to the letter.\n\nThen you’ll run it and find out it’s not.\n\nGTA Online is certainly a game where one must make plans and quickly revise them, and they have consequences as you can see in my mugshot. A running theme of Grand Theft Auto is the gleeful way you must drive through road signs, blockades, and even people to meet your goals. Without adult supervision, your AI agent will adopt its plans to do bad things because you said it had to get to the goal.\n\n6. Pedal to the Metal\n\nTesting the Plan\n\nAfter seeing your plan written out better than you could write it yourself, the agent will undoubtedly offer to just go ahead and shoot to kill. And you should absolutely not do this.\n\nI’ll stop here to say that, even if you have no intention of letting an agent change your code, it can be very useful to have it generate documentation for you or others in the form of these plans. You can ask it to describe how something works in your existing code, put it in an .md file in a /docs folder, and grow that library of doc.\n\nIt’s smart to do this even if no one else reads your code because you can @mention these doc files to attach them to prompts, thus making “mini-rules,” and we’ll look at how to turn those into other kinds of rules, including automated ones, in a moment.\n\nOften, all the right steps are in the plan but, for various reasons, they might need to be done in a different order than the model suggested. You might decide to do file or terminal operations locally, for example. Don’t bother changing the plan or telling Cursor anything. Just tell it to do step 3 when you want that, even if it’s first. Don’t spend credits on edumacation that ain’t goin’ nowhere, as we know LLMs don’t increase their understanding through more talking.\n\nTesting your plan vs. your actual code will reveal many ugly truths about what you, the human, have written.\n\nOften, you’ll want to make some other refactor or cleanup before having the agent start the plan, and you should do anything you can to “clear the path.”\n\nThis is another place where we lose folks on the AI road. “But if I just code it myself, I don’t have to do any of that.” Hard to argue that one. The truth is that testing what’s written in your plan vs. what’s actually in your codebase will reveal many ugly truths about what you, the human, have written.\n\nIt’s easy to say, “I don’t have to time to cleanup my code right now. I need to ship this.” And that, my friends, is how we get tech debt.\n\nOne of the best uses of agents is in refactoring — and yet we hear people saying it can’t be done! I’m here to exclaim the opposite. A careful refactoring of something pointed out by the AI is extremely useful. It’s shining light onto a cavity that you haven’t seen. Drill, baby, drill!\n\nAs long as your refactoring follows the plan for making plans that I’m laying out here, you’ll wind up with less tech debt across the codebase. You’ll have code that’s much easier for you and for the agent to work with in the future — code that won’t get left behind because nobody understands and it nobody can really work on it anymore.\n\nWhether or not you choose to refactor from something you see in the plan, you should do that as a separate thread with its own plan. Avoid the temptation to keep injecting that drug from Dr. Feelgood. Whichever plan you’re on, only allow the tool to do one step at a time, and commit and test yourself after each step.\n\nIf you tell the AI what you want, you might be heard one day and ignored the next.\n\nIt’s exasperating to find that the AI keeps missing “obvious” things, but they are only obvious to you from the time you spent working on this codebase and others. LLMs don’t accumulate knowledge like people. Even having millions of lines of code in their training doesn’t give them any understanding of code, it only gives them a terrific predictive ability based on repeated exposure to code in other contexts.\n\nA large training base actually makes it less likely that it will correctly guess custom code that applies to your environment. The retrieval system always shows the most likely answer (in the context of the prompt and the current random seed). This means that the most likely answer will not be the solution that exactly matches your custom architecture. It won’t be the predominate stuff in the training set.\n\nThis is why we see LLMs constantly try to steer you toward rando solutions that they are “certain” will work. It’s because they’ve seen these in their training sets in the context of the question you asked. That doesn’t mean that the meaning or use of your code is taken into account when giving the answer.\n\nIf we tell a human, “Look, Larry, we always use composition and don’t write things that inherit from each other,” you would expect that to be a one-time mention or maybe even something you add to a code style manual. If you tell the AI that, you might be heard one day and ignored the next. It’s not “learning” anything from you. It’s predicting what you want to hear.\n\nYou can improve some of these predictions with plans and rules, but we’ll never get to 100%. LLMs are not databases and don’t reproduce the code they were trained on directly. It can even be hard for them to reproduce your own code exactly, since that’s not the most likely code to be predicted. And they have no way to understand your code’s meaning and purpose unless you describe how those intersect with the way it’s written.\n\nTrust But Verify\n\nAfter the model exclaims that all your steps are finished and the app is working, it might — depending on its mood — offer to run it in the terminal. I would say, “Never mind,” at least with web apps. There are agent wiring tools that supposedly can round-trip between writing code and viewing the browser results (to go back and fix the code), but I’m not a believer in that just yet.\n\nYour original “goal” could be very far away in the thread and no longer considered important.\n\nI run all builds and tests in my own terminal window and you probably should, too. And I look at all user-facing output in the browser, just as a user would and gradually as the app develops. Asking the LLM to test its own output has a chance of sending it down a wrong road to make a fix, or faking the test to make it work (like inserting mock data or changing the test criteria), or even outright lying and saying the tests work when they clearly don’t.\n\nIn a real example of this, I had Cursor help me fix text with ellipses. It’s supposed to happen with CSS and grow or shrink with other items but is notoriously difficult to get right inside a series of shifting containers. After giving up on its own solution, Cursor changed the Typescript code to trim off some number of characters from the string and put “…” at the end! This might look the same in some cases but very much is not. It took me a bit to notice. Trust, but verify.\n\nThe reason for this is the same reason for all the other behavior we hate. These are predictive answers, not provable ones. The AI is predicting that the code works and then predicting a solution that will work when the first one doesn’t. Your original “goal” isn’t even part of the predictive process. It could be very far away in the thread and no longer considered important. People do this, too. We forget a fact or a name after a convo or a movie scene goes on for a long time.\n\nTake the time to write a good ticket and you’ll get back a real fix.\n\nWhen your real, human test fails, don’t ask the AI to correct the problem immediately. Instead, you guessed it, ask for a plan for the fix. Provide screenshots of the output that’s a problem and explain exactly why. Provide console or terminal messages and screen captures of the browser inspector where those would help the agent in finding the fix.\n\nI pasted this screenshot into a Cursor chat while debugging the text that ends with ellipses. I used a trick that works like dental disclosing tablets — putting red boxes (with CSS) around the problem elements. Then you can mention that in your prompt to help Cursor see what it should be working on. You can also paste architectural diagrams if you have those or need to draw one to explain something better than words.\n\nIn other words, don’t write a shitty JIRA ticket. Take the time to write a good ticket and you’ll get back a real fix. The fix itself may take more than one try (thus having a plan for it), but you’ll be surprised at how many flowers bloom from these crazy planting sessions. The joy we all feel as software developers when it “just works” is very much there when you get the agent to the finish line — after following your plan!\n\nThere is no secret tech debt left behind, either. This method forces you to become a ninja over your own codebase and to write and review documentation about how it works. The AI isn’t replacing you as a developer, it’s helping you level-up.\n\nAnd those three dots? In the end, I had to manually fix the ellipses everywhere I wanted them. Because it’s tricky and not often used, there aren’t many examples in the model’s training — and you’ll find this true of every cool thing in your code. You will have to ‘splain all the cool stuff and the most unique parts, your secret sauce, you will have to design and somewhat implement manually.\n\nI visited this set in Rosarito, Mexico where Titanic was filmed during the brief time it was open for tours. What’s not shown here is that the ship has no other side. When shots from the port side were needed they were taken through a reversing lens. Luggage tags and signage for those scenes were printed with mirrored text to appear correctly on film. How many illusions in your code will working with an AI agent uncover?\n\n7. A Disaster of Titanic Proportions\n\nFinding Bigger Problems\n\nThe most humbling part of agentic coding, and possibly the most beneficial, is the realization that all of the bad code is your fault. I’ve been in many standup meetings, retrospectives, and other blame games in my career and I can’t recall a time when everyone stood up and gleefully took responsibility for their bad code. Yet this is what you must do to optimize for agents.\n\nWe get away with shipping bad code because most bugs don’t take down the whole house of cards.\n\nWe write bad code for two reasons. First, coding is extremely difficult. The immediacy of seeing the agent code something and then realizing that it’s wrong should be proof that the real act is harder than it appears.\n\nEven the best-informed, most well intentioned programmers write and ship lousy code. We are driven to by the demands of the product and by our employers, and we get away with it because most bugs don’t take down the whole house of cards, so we fix and push past them.\n\nFixing code, even when we know it’s not great, is also hard. It takes time and brainpower we don’t always want to give. Sometimes, it really isn’t worth it. We can’t rebuild an ideal version of everything in software dev just to get one product out the door. The days of fully handcrafted software where one team is responsible for every line of code went away decades ago. Even as an Army of One, we ship code with compromises.\n\nAI tears down a wall. Ignore what’s on the other side at your own peril.\n\nThe second reason we write bad code is caused by the first. It’s the badge of honor that we wear as programmers, the fact that we do work that the vast majority of people cannot do — something we share with great doctors and lawyers and other professionals at a similar pay grade.\n\nWe don’t want to come down from the ivory tower of our profession and say that our stuff has holes. It has flaws. It has a crappy UI. We didn’t make what the user wanted. We made it too hard. We didn’t want to learn a new tool. We like doing it this way already, etc., etc. We say, “The operation was successful but the patient died.”\n\nIf you work in software, you know this is true. AI tears down this wall. Ignore what’s on the other side at your own peril.\n\nCursor didn’t say, “Sorry, Dave, I’m afraid your software can’t do that.”\n\nIn developing the Watson Engine for my new game, I started with a framework of my own design that I’d used in global production in numerous apps already. It definitely allowed me get a demo together quickly. But when I started poking around the edges with Cursor, looking to add more game designer features, I came to see architectural problems that were not problems in the previous apps but would be stumbling blocks for Watson.\n\nHere’s an architectural diagram that I made to help decide how I wanted a major refactor to work. I pasted this diagram directly into Cursor while having it write the plan with me. Consistent naming and formatting, like braces around names of JSON objects and square brackets for arrays, let Cursor understand me without explaining. This is another new variation of “doc as code,” having the AI write something that matches an architecture diagram. In case you’re wondering, I use Xmind for these diagrams.\n\nIt’s important to note that Cursor didn’t say, “Sorry, Dave, I’m afraid your software can’t do that.” Other devs have complained that agents will fully comply and in fact blow smoke up your skirt to tell you how great your thing already is. The epiphany comes from you carefully looking at the kinds of problems you’re running into with the agent.\n\nWhat is it misunderstanding? What is it repeatedly having trouble implementing? What part of your architecture or design are sub-optimal, thus forcing “hoop jumping” by the agent?\n\nIf you can spot these bandits when they repeatedly appear in your field of view, you can see a path to a bigger architectural change that will simplify development for the agent, and for you. Don’t try to wrestle the LLM into working around your bad design. Just fix it, and use the AI to plan and implement those changes.\n\nThe reason this is needed with agentic coding is that we do it already with our own code, we’re just hesitant to admit it and certainly don’t talk about it with others. We reach that “code exhaustion” point where we say, “This whole thing isn’t working and I need to rethink it.” When we are able to state the problem out loud, we are halfway to the solution.\n\nThe only difference between being personally “beat down” into fixing your own bad design and agentic coding is the agent’s huge speed jump points out your problems sooner. That’s also an opportunity because you can use the agent in investigation mode to figure out your architectural problem and solve it in isolation, earlier in your delivery process. The earlier you find a problem, the cheaper and easier it is to fix.\n\nWhen I was a child in the 70’s, I opened one of my dad’s drawers and found a slide rule, like this one. Having just discovered (the just invented) electronic calculators, I quickly put it back and closed the drawer. The “rule” in a slide rule is the ruler device, the tool. But the rules about how to use it have to come from you. I didn’t have those rules and couldn’t make use of it. Everyone starts out this way with AI agents.\n\n8. Tell It Like It Is\n\nMaking Rules\n\nIn my first article about Cursor, I didn’t make use of its rules file and instead evolved this method of plans I’m sharing with you. Since then, Cursor has upgraded the rules system so it works just like these plans, including having Cursor write and update rules itself.\n\nRules files differ from plans in one key way, and that’s how they get added to a prompt.\n\nAlways Auto Attached Agent Assigned Manual\n\nAn Always rule gets sent before every single prompt you type. Save this for context that the model really needs on every request, and that’s probably less than you think. It’s tempting to say, “It needs to know everything about my app for every change,” but that’s not really true.\n\nThe more context your prompt has, the more likely it will fail.\n\nI use two Always rules files, one for the Watson Engine and one for the underlying Slate framework. That second file is used in other repos built with Slate, like my personal website. When I find that Cursor does something wacky that’s related to one of these underlying frameworks, I will ask Cursor to “update the rules file with what we’ve learned.” This reduces the chances of the same mistake happening again and has completely eliminated some major annoyances.\n\nHere’s part of my Always rule file for Slate applications. Try to write in dictionary style here, with concise positive statements (do’s, not don’ts). It’s worth writing stuff in here if you find it’s coming up wrong repeatedly. With the latest updates, Cursor can write and modify these files itself when you ask.\n\nAn Auto Attached rule gets attached when a file you want the AI to work on matches a regex pattern. If you needed to make a rule for all your .ts files or only the ones in the /node folder, you might apply it here. I don’t personally use this feature.\n\nAgent Assigned is a cool rule that gets attached based on a prompt. In other words, you write a short description of when the rule file should be applied. If you have a collection of style rules, you might mark that file as Agent Assigned with the description, “When I ask for style changes anywhere in the app.” That invokes a hidden prompt (one of many in Cursor) that asks if your prompt matches that rule, then injects the rule if it does before submitting the prompt itself.\n\nThis is an example of the “reasoning” done by AI reasoning models (chewing your own cud) but in this case it’s done by Cursor and works with all models.\n\nA Manual rule is just what it sounds like. This is perfect for things like build rules or rules for other languages or environments like the terminal that you don’t need in every situation. Marking a rule manual requires a @mention to have it included it in a prompt, just like the plan files we made. That way, it doesn’t pollute the context of your other prompts and doesn’t consume tokens.\n\nPrinters are considered highly unreliable today, but in the 1970’s, IBM invented high volume devices for printing bills. Later, they moved into machines that could remove a check from an envelope you’d mailed and credit your account with the right amount. These machines were built through rigorous debugging, as paper is notoriously hard to handle. Careful examination of your code all the way through from startup to shipping will show where the path is broken. These kind of machines are still used to send you bills and bank statements.\n\n9. It’s Not a Gift Horse\n\nPerformance Payback\n\nIt’s clear by now that agentic coding requires an investment in human effort as well as AI subscription and token costs that must be justified by the results.\n\nAt IBM, I was trained in debugging mainframe compilers at the assembler level and I’ve always enjoyed a debugging-first view of programming. 70% of software development time is debugging, though that’s not discussed much. So perhaps I’m biased when I say that refactoring and debugging are outstanding uses of AI, perhaps more so than feature development.\n\nFeature development is the great joy of coding, while debugging happens closer to the sewers. The problem with the “castles in the sky” possibilities of feature coding with AI is that you will get back just that — a fairy castle that only lives in the sky and can’t be shipped. As a mental confection, it doesn’t have enough bones yet. There’s no there, there.\n\nFeel free to admit that you don’t know something or can’t understand why it doesn’t work.\n\nDebugging is harder than making up new features. Here we have to take something broken, unbreak it, and not break anything else in the process. This requires far deeper understanding than writing a new feature in isolation. The investigative phase of agent coding shines here.\n\nNo AI is coming to your standup to hear you bare your soul. Feel free to admit that you don’t know about something or you can’t understand why it doesn’t work. Be sure to do everything you know how to do first and say everything you did and what results you found.\n\nI’m definitely biased in my views on Sherlock Holmes (a protagonist in my game), but did you know his creator Arthur Conan Doyle invented modern forensic science when he described these techniques of collecting and laying out facts by asking questions and admitting holes in one’s knowledge? Up until then, even famous police departments like London’s relied on guesswork and fantasy ideation.\n\nBy taking a forensic approach with an agent, you come away a better investigator and a better programmer. You’ll be better able to craft the rules and the prompts you need to get your own code to the next level, and you’ll be able to talk about it with other people — programmers and non-programmers — in an understandable way.\n\nRefactoring is the way to start agent coding.\n\nRefactoring is where I would start with any serious work on agent coding. You’re going to wind up doing it anyway as you find the problems I mentioned. If you already know something has code smell in your own app, have the AI help you remove it. If you’re not sure of a safe way, ask. If you’re not sure about options or impacts, ask. The test for a refactor is that it works exactly the same as before, and that’s easy for you to verify.\n\nRefactoring with an AI is so fast that we can and should do it in a lot of places where we never took the time. Tasks where we say, “Ugh, I should change this but I would have to do that across 43 modules,” become easy when we have the AI make a plan and fix the plan. That part might take as long as doing or one or two changes manually. But the other 41 modules are going to take just seconds. Performance payback.\n\nWhen there’s a special case that comes up in your plans, just describe it then and there. There’s no need to modify the plan itself unless the special is going to happen repeatedly. Even then, you can often say something like “Do that in the way we did the animations.” It’s tempting to pile on context but it doesn’t create learning, it only increases the prompt length and adds confusion.\n\nWhen you go to revise or add to your refactored code, it’s cleaner and more in line with your long term goals. You don’t have to figure out how to provide a place to add the new feature because you cleaned that up already. With the speed of these AI tools, we will be cleaning up a lot more code than we ever did, making it more valuable over the long haul of our business. Performance payback.\n\nFinally, when we do write features, we can refer to the squeaky clean codebase we’ve factored up to and we can reference all the rules and plans that we’ve made for the new feature. We’re not going to say, “Make a new so-and-so.” We’re going to say, “Make a plan that includes…” and mention our important rules and files. Then, we’ll will work with the model to revise and act on that plan, one step at a time.\n\nAs before, everything I’ve said not to do is something I did. These are brave times on the new frontier. You will make mistakes, too, and find your own way. Don’t give up on the early tries. You’ll have to adapt your combat style to make effective use of these weapons.\n\nAside from what I’ve learned, forcing myself through these architectural changes and new prompting methods resulted in an overall design that makes it much easier to add features to my engine and, ultimately, to ship it to the platforms I want so that it can be monetized. Performance payback.\n\nL.A. Noire from Rockstar Games is an amazing title that happily ate 50 hours of my life. It’s proof that good software doesn’t go bad. The game moves fluidly from action, to planning/debugging (what you’ll say to suspects and witnesses and how you’ll handle their BS), and finally to deep thinking where you must decide whom to accuse. Although AI tools will offer to “automatically” move between these type of actions, you’ll want to manually control that.\n\n10. Model Me This\n\nChoosing Models\n\nIn my last article, I didn’t make any changes to Cursor’s model settings. Since then, the number of options available and their prices have exploded dramatically. Having models consume credits is the primary way that Cursor consumes your money, so these settings now bear examination.\n\nWhat I write here is likely to be out of date soon, too, so take it with a grain of salt. What I’ve found is that models come in three basic flavors:\n\nAction models. Planning/debugging models. Deep thinking models.\n\nHere’s a tiny piece of the current Cursor models list, and it’s a long list! You can judiciously turn on and off the models you like that have good value for the money, then use them in the right kinds of prompts.\n\nAction models are the ones that don’t have the “max” or “thinking” label on them. These are great for direct instructions in the form of, “Do this according to my prewritten plan.” Direct action models are cheaper. They make only one pass through your prompt before acting on it, hence this name I made up.\n\nPlanning models are the ones that have “reasoning” or “thinking” on the label. These cost more and consume more credits even with the same request because they send the results from the first pass back to the model with the original request to check for conformance.\n\nIt’s good to use one of these models when you’re writing or revising a plan for debugging, for a refactor, or for adding a new feature — which is why I made up this name. But you should manually switch to an action model and start a new thread once the plan is written. In the new thread, write, “According to our plan @menu-fixes-plan.md do step 1.” This keeps the model from thinking too deeply and possibly inventing or revising instructions on its own.\n\nDeep thinking models in Cursor are labeled max . These are allowed a much larger context window and can take any number of reasoning steps until they’ve convinced themselves that they’re done.\n\nA nebulous definition of both “done” and how we get there can lead to surprising and expensive results, especially since deep thinking models in Cursor are priced on a per prompt basis (currently 5¢). These are excellent for complex assignments like planning a massive refactor or deciding how a new feature will be implemented and crafting example code and data structures in a plan file. But don’t leave them turned on when you don’t need them.\n\nA problem with letting Cursor choose the model is that it can limit the context, often excluding the parts you need.\n\nIt might seem like leaving Cursor in the default mode of auto-selecting the model would be the easiest, and I originally thought so, too. The problem with that approach is that you’re letting Cursor pick how to submit your prompt, what it can do, and what it will cost. Today, I recommend carefully looking at the menu of model prices, choosing which ones you will enable in your Cursor settings, and then choosing which categories of model you will use for any specific prompt from the drop-down before you start the thread.\n\nAnother problem with using action models when you don’t have a plan is that Cursor limits the context, often excluding the parts you need. If you ask for a change that’s deep inside a file (say 400 lines in), Cursor might not even see the lines you’re after if the model limits the prompt to the first 250 lines — and yes, it often does just that.\n\nWhen dealing with configurations, CSS, or data files this mistake can be fatal because Cursor might decide that the data doesn’t exist or should be invented when it’s really just later in the file. Cursor can recover from these hiccups (when it says, “reading the next 250 lines,” for example), but if you know you need a larger context, it’s easier to pay for a max model for the request that makes the plan. You don’t need max to revise the plan (try a reasoning model) or to act on it (use an action model).\n\nWhen starting a new chat, you can choose the “agent profile” and edit, in a limited way, the abilities it has. If I start with this Ask profile, for example, no files can be changed. All the answers have to come out in the chat window. You can switch to agent mode as soon as you want action and just ask for it without repeating the convo from Ask mode, which is included in all prompts in the thread.\n\nFor a final chef’s touch, you can now make combinations of model settings and tool limits and give them your own names. The Cursor doc suggested “Ask” and “Plan” as examples, so I made those. I like to pull down my “Plan” setting from the chat dialog and get the plan handled, then start a new thread, pull down Agent (a built-in settings group you can also edit), mention the plan, and ask to start a step.\n\nThe famous Sorcerer’s Apprentice scene in 1940’s Fantasia is from a much older Goethe poem written in 1797. (Disney loved public domain IP but did have to license the music for this one.) The TL;DR is “Only the master should invoke powerful spirits,” and this applies more in agentic coding than any other kind of software development. You’ll need to become a master of programming yourself to master it.\n\n11. The Taking of Credits 123\n\nCost Controls\n\nCursor is an amazing application with lots of magic to discover and use, but they would prefer you not use any cost controls. After all, wouldn’t it best if we just had the full Sorcerer’s Apprentice do all the mopping? It certainly would cost more.\n\nThis is no shade to Anysphere, its maker. We repeatedly see stories of “I spent $150 in a weekend with vibe coding.” Who wouldn’t love that as a vendor?\n\nThe onus is on you to control your costs through four levers:\n\nSet monthly cost limits. Turn models on and off. Look for deals on model pricing. Pick the right model for the prompt.\n\nCursor allows you to set a monthly spending limit which can’t be exceed until you adjust it. This is your first line of defense. You should regularly visit your account usage page to see how much you’re consuming versus where your code is today. When you fill a swimming pool, you typically look at the water meter before and after and Cursor has just such a usage meter.\n\nThink about the human time and real money spending versus the code you got out of it to see if it’s a good value. Remember that the output is only as good as your input. Some types of tasks you assign will result in minor miracles. Others will be abject failures. Use the tool only for the areas where it’s proven successful, and keep trying new areas to see what’s possible.\n\nYour second line of defense is to enable and disable models in your Cursor settings. If a model is crappy or too expensive, disable it. Then, no one can call it regardless of rules or automatic tool selection.\n\nDon’t be surprised if new free models aren’t as good as the proven, expensive favorites.\n\nNext, look for special pricing on models as they are introduced (or succeeded). These deals often allow some amount of free or heavily discounted use to entice to you try new models. As of this writing, there are more than 25 available, all with their own pricing.\n\nAs I said of all things free, don’t be surprised if new free models aren’t as good as the proven, expensive favorites. They got that way because of millions of devs like you using them, showing the value in the premium tier.\n\nLike an online water meter, you can check your Cursor consumption before and after you fill the pool. No one knows what this stuff should cost or will eventually cost, so it’s a good idea to go in here and look at actual use and spending at key points in your project.\n\nI read too many stories of devs not willing to invest $20 in trying a premium AI. Twenty whole dollars. Then they say AI gives crappy results because they were running Llama free on their laptop. Come on.\n\nIf a model disappoints, disconnect it. It’s not worth your time to add extra bad answers on top of the bad answers the best models already give.\n\nLike tooling, model offerings change daily. Don’t lull yourself to sleep on AI coding because of something you experienced last year, last month, or even last week. One of the biggest risks for providers of these models and tools is how easy it is to switch between them. Use that to your advantage to see what’s viable today.\n\nThe full list of Cursor models and their prices can change at any time. You can use these prices with what you know about enabling models and using them in specific prompts to get better value and better results.\n\nIt’s also possible to use models from different vendors for planning, debugging, or coding. Experiment with several to see which ones seem to understand you the best, which ones write the best plans, and which ones stay on track when executing plans. This is all very much in flex so don’t get married to anything.\n\nThe final price control is that drop-down I mentioned in the chat box. By choosing the smallest model for the task you need (but no smaller), you reduce the context window and reduce drifting, improving the results.\n\n1982’s Tron was a groundbreaking film for computer graphics. The dev gamer turned hacker protagonist is trapped inside the machine by an evil algo, the Master Control Program. Despite the (not accidental) name, the MCP for AI agents is just an API for them to talk to each other. Making MCP work is another battle of man versus machine.\n\n12. Master Control Program\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP)\n\nIf the buzzword last month was “vibe coding,” this month it’s MCP. And while it’s tempting to think of it as the Master Control Program from TRON with similar capabilities, MCP is no such thing. It’s merely a protocol, a method of passing LLM prompts and tool calls back and forth between software running on different machines.\n\nThere are two important things to know about MCP right away:\n\nAnything you can do with MCP you’re already doing without it. It winds up being prompt and tool calls, all the way down.\n\nNaïve voices in our industry are suggesting that somehow with MCP we’ll be able to wrangle all these agentic cats and they’ll finally be under our command. But that defies the first rule of MCP. Anything it can do you are already doing.\n\nMCP is an API format for agents to talk to each other.\n\nWe know this is true because MCP only provides a schema, a way to declare what LLMs and tools you want to call and a way for those tools and agents to declare what kind of queries they accept. To make use of any of this, you must already know the tools (APIs) you want to call and must provide the integrations in your app to make use of the LLM results (RAG) — things you’re already doing. If you have a large enough selection of models and tools that you need to call, it might help you to define those.\n\nThe actual data in MCP? No surprise there. It’s JSON and Markdown. Keys and values go in JSON and prompts are in Markdown. If one thing can be said for AI development, it’s that we’ve quickly settled on JSON APIs (and in fact largely standardized around one schema for LLM calls, the OpenAI API format, used even by competing vendors). The use of Markdown to handle prompts echoes the use of Markdown in plans and rules, for we saw that these merely get attached to a prompt in practice and are not separated from (nor more important than) the rest of the prompt.\n\nThis leads to MCP realization #2. Since at the end of the day, all we have is the combination of prompts and tool calling, we shouldn’t expect any magic to arise from MCP that we aren’t already seeing with manually orchestrated LLM prompts or RAG integrations.\n\nIn fact, I’d argue that canonizing prompts and tool call invocations is likely to be more brittle than the way we do it now. There’s a tendency to over-engineer everything if we’re telling the LLM when to activate a tool based on some prompt or reply.\n\nOn the other end, we tend to forget things that we should bring up in the scaffold because they seem obvious to people. Already, early MCP adopters are reporting “leaking” in their scaffolds where the (fixed) rules fail to properly account for the real (variable) inputs and outputs. We know this to be the case from interactive agentic coding. MCP is just frozen, declarative code for the tool calls and prompts that run through it.\n\nOver and Out!\n\nThat’s all for today, folks. I hope you found this info helpful. If you did, a clap, comment, or share to your network helps my visibility. I do thank you.\n\nI’m also available for AI consulting, writing, and coding for your organization.\n\nAs always, I invite you to review my other articles here on Medium and visit the AI Dev Blog on my website for more insights, ideas, and contact information.\n\nUntil next time… Be well!\n\n— D"}

On the latest episode of Chat G&G from AnfieldIndex, hosts Grizz Khan and Gags Tandon shared raw, emotional reactions following Liverpool’s crowning moment.\n\nIntoxicated by Liverpool’s Triumph\n\nGrizz Khan captured the mood perfectly, admitting, “The intoxication comes from my love affair with this football club.” Describing the aftermath, he confessed, “Today Gags, I am so battered and so bruised I’ve been relaxing putting my feet up in the sun in the garden trying to recover.”\n\nThe intensity of the celebration was not lost on Gags either, who revealed that he spent most of his free time re-watching Liverpool’s official coverage. “I’m still rewatching it,” he said. “Every single second of it… anytime I get on my own, I’m watching it.”\n\nJoy After Decades of Waiting\n\nDiscussing the significance of the title, Grizz explained the scale of the moment: “You wait 35 years to celebrate with your fans,” adding, “We’ve watched everybody else win it for 35 years… dreaming of when is it going to be us and yesterday we got it.”\n\nIt was a poignant reflection on the past pain, with Gags noting, “We’ve been within touching distance at least three times and then we couldn’t even celebrate.” This season felt different, a catharsis not only for the players but for the fans who had endured so much.\n\nParty Like It’s 2025\n\nThroughout the episode, humour and happiness intertwined. Grizz joked, “Party like 1999 is an old thing – it’s got to be party like 2025, mate!” This sentiment captured the sense of relief and uncontained joy amongst Liverpool supporters.\n\nHe also referenced his playful antics with a Manchester United fan at work: “When I unzip got the white Liverpool shirt he was like ‘You bastard.'”\n\nThe hosts were quick to highlight the natural flow of celebrations, with Grizz proudly stating, “None of that in my opinion was pre-planned or pre-ordained. It was all natural flow and that’s what we’re about.”\n\nThe Champions’ Mentality\n\nAs Liverpool’s new era under Arne Slot begins, Gags pointed out how the club’s winning culture endured: “Slot touched upon that… he said the winning culture and mentality of this squad – amazing.”\n\nGrizz agreed, stressing the influence of experienced leaders: “Look at the players behind – Mo, Ali, Trent, Robo, Gomez – you’re going to look up to them.”\n\nThe episode also touched on individual stories, such as Ibrahima Konaté’s struggles. Grizz shared Konaté’s feelings: “I felt like a flipping loser,” highlighting the centre-back’s resilience through past defeats in finals before finally tasting league success."}

Can you imagine making a pioneering discovery in the cosmos? Want to help solve problems that could improve life on our planet? Or maybe you dream of helping solve an ancient mystery of the universe? All of this is possible through NASA’s Citizen Science program.\n\nNASA defines citizen science, or participatory science, as “science projects that rely on volunteers,” said Dr. Marc Kuchner, an astrophysicist and the Citizen Science Officer in the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C.\n\nFor decades, volunteers have been supporting NASA researchers in different fields and in a variety of ways, depending on the project. They help by taking measurements, sorting data from NASA missions, and deepening our understanding of the universe and our home planet. It all counts.\n\n“That’s science for you: It’s collaborative,” said Kuchner, who oversees the more than 30 citizen science projects NASA offers. “I connect the public and scientists to get more NASA science done.”\n\nNASA astrophysicist Marc Kuchner is a pioneer in participatory science and today serves as NASA's Citizen Science program officer. In 2014, Kuchner created the Disk Detective project, which helps NASA scientists study how planets form. Kuchner has also been the principal investigator for some of the agency's many citizen science projects, but today he oversees the portfolio and promotes volunteer participation around the world.\n\nCredit: David Friedlander\n\nA menu of projects for all tastes\n\nCitizen scientists can come from anywhere in the world—they do not have to be U.S. citizens or residents. Volunteers help NASA look for planets in other solar systems, called exoplanets; sort clouds in Earth’s sky; observe solar eclipses; or detect comets and asteroids. Some of those space rocks are even named after the volunteers who helped find them.\n\nMass participation is key in initiatives that require as many human eyes as possible. “There are science projects that you can't do without the help of a big team,” Kuchner said. For example, projects that need large datasets from space telescopes—or “things that are physically big and you need people in different places looking from different angles,” he said.\n\nOne example is Aurorasaurus, which invites people to observe and classify northern and southern auroras. “We try to study them with satellites, but it really helps to have people on the ground taking photos from different places at different times,” he explained.\n\n“Part of the way we serve our country and humankind is by sharing not just the pretty pictures from our satellites, but the entire experience of doing science,” Kuchner said.\n\nMore than 3 million people have participated in the program. Kuchner believes that shows how much people want to be part of what he calls the “roller coaster” of science. “They want to go on that adventure with us, and we are thrilled to have them.”\n\nThe dream of discovering\n\n“You can help scientists who are now at NASA and other organizations around the world to discover interesting things,” said Faber Burgos, a citizen scientist and science communicator from Colombia. “Truth be told, I’ve always dreamed of making history.”\n\nColombian citizen scientist Faber Burgos studied Modern Languages at the Colombian School of Industrial Careers and has a university degree in Classical Archaeology. Today, he is dedicated to disseminating science content through his social media accounts, focusing on children. In 2020, he and his team launched a balloon probe into the stratosphere with a camera that captured the curvature of the Earth, with the aim of demonstrating that the Earth is round. The video of that feat exceeds 97 million views on his Facebook account, earning him a Guinness World Record.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Faber Burgos\n\nBurgos has been involved in two projects for the past four years: the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC), which searches the sky for potentially dangerous asteroids, and Backyard Worlds: Planet 9. This project uses data from NASA’s now-completed Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and its follow-up mission, NEOWISE, to search for brown dwarfs and a hypothetical ninth planet.\n\n“There are really amazing participants in this project,” said Kuchner, who helped launch it in 2015. NASA’s WISE and NEOWISE missions detected about 2 billion sources in the sky. “So, the question is: Among those many sources, are any of them new unknowns?” he said.\n\nThe project has already found more than 4,000 brown dwarfs. These are Jupiter-sized objects—balls of gas that are too big to be planets, but too small to be stars. Volunteers have even helped discover a new type of brown dwarf.\n\nParticipants in the project are also hopeful they’ll find a hypothetical ninth planet, possibly Neptune-sized, in an orbit far beyond Pluto.\n\nThe Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project asks volunteers to help search for new objects at the edge of our solar system. The assignment is to review images from NASA's past WISE and NEOWISE missions in search of two types of astronomical objects: brown dwarfs(balls of gas the same size as Jupiter that have too little mass to be considered stars) and low-mass stars. Or, even, the hypothetical ninth planet of our Sun, known as Planet nine, or Planet X. The image shows an artist's rendering of such a hypothetical world orbiting far from the Sun.\n\nCredit: Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC) Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC)\n\nBurgos explained that analyzing the images is easy. “If it’s a moving object, it’s obviously going to be something of interest,” he said. “Usually, when you see these images, everything is still. But if there’s an object moving, you have to keep an eye on it.”\n\nOnce a citizen scientist marks the object across the full image sequence, they send the information to NASA scientists to evaluate.\n\n“As a citizen scientist, I’m happy to do my bit and, hopefully, one day discover something very interesting,” he said. “That’s the beauty of NASA—it invites everyone to be a scientist. Here, it doesn’t matter what you are, but your desire to learn.”\n\nThe first step\n\nTo become a NASA citizen scientist, start by visiting the program’s website. There you’ll find a complete list of available projects with links to their respective sites. Some are available in Spanish and other languages. Many projects are also hosted on the Zooniverse platform, which has been available since 2006.\n\n“Another cool way to get involved is to come to one of our live events,” said Kuchner. These are virtual events open to the public, where NASA scientists present their projects and invite people to participate. “Pick a project you like—and if it’s not fun, pick a different one,” he advised. “There are wonderful relationships to be had if you reach out to scientists and other participants.”\n\nAnother way for people to get involved in citizen science is to participate in the annual NASA International Space Apps Challenge, the largest global hackathon. This two-day event creates innovation through international collaboration, providing an opportunity for participants to use NASA's free and open data and agency partners' space-based data to tackle real-world problems on Earth and in space. The next NASA International Space Apps Challenge will be October 4-5, 2025.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nAge is not the limit\n\nPeople of all ages can be citizen scientists. Some projects are kid-friendly, such as Nemo-Net, an iPad game that invites participants to color coral reefs to help sort them. “I’d like to encourage young people to start there—or try a project with one of the older people in their life,” Kuchner said.\n\nCitizen science can also take place in classrooms. In the Growing Beyond Earth project, teachers and students run experiments on how to grow plants in space for future missions. The IASC project also works with high schools to help students detect asteroids.\n\nA student waters small plants inside a Growing Beyond Earth citizen science project grow box.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nProjects by the community, for the community\n\nGLOBE Observer is another initiative with an international network of teachers and students. The platform offers a range of projects—many in Spanish—that invite people to collect data using their cell phones.\n\nOne of the most popular is the GLOBE Mosquito Habitat Mapper, which tracks the migration and spread of mosquitoes that carry diseases. “It’s a way to help save lives—tracking the vectors that transmit malaria and Zika, among others,” Kuchner said.\n\nOther GLOBE projects explore everything from ground cover to cloud types. Some use astronomical phenomena visible to everyone. For example, during the 2024 total solar eclipse, participants measured air temperature using their phones and shared that data with NASA scientists.\n\nThe full experience of doing science\n\nNo prior studies are needed, but many volunteers go on to collaborate on—or even lead—scientific research. More than 500 NASA citizen scientists have co-authored scientific publications.\n\nOne of them is Hugo Durantini Luca, from Córdoba, Argentina, who has participated in 17 published articles, with more on the way. For years, he explored various science projects, looking for one where he could contribute more actively.\n\nDurantini Luca participated in one of NASA's first citizen science projects, launched in 2006: Stardust at home. Still ongoing, this project invites volunteers to participate in the search for evidence of interstellar dust on the aerogel and aluminum foil collectors returned by NASA's Stardust mission, using an online virtual microscope.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nHe participated in NASA’s first citizen science project, Stardust@home, which invites users to search for interstellar dust particles in collectors from the Stardust mission, using a virtual microscope.\n\nIn 2014, he discovered Disk Detective, a project that searches for disks around stars, where planets may form. By looking at images from the WISE and NEOWISE missions, participants can help understand how worlds are born and how solar systems evolve.\n\n“And, incidentally, if we find planets or some sign of life, all the better,” said Durantini Luca.\n\nAlthough that remains a dream, they have made other discoveries—like a new kind of stellar disk called the “Peter Pan Disk,” which appears young even though the star it surrounds is not.\n\nDurantini Luca participated in one of NASA's first citizen science projects, launched in 2006: Stardust at home. Still ongoing, this project invites volunteers to participate in the search for evidence of interstellar dust on the aerogel and aluminum foil collectors returned by NASA's Stardust mission, using an online virtual microscope.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nScience in person\n\nIn 2016, Durantini Luca got the chance to support Disk Detective with his own observations from the southern hemisphere. He traveled to El Leoncito Astronomical Complex (CASLEO), an observatory in San Juan, Argentina. There, he learned to use a spectrograph—an instrument that breaks down starlight to analyze its composition.\n\nHe treasures that experience. “Curiously, it was the first time in my life I used a telescope,” he said.\n\nIn 2016, citizen scientist Hugo Durantini Luca traveled for 18 hours to the El Leoncito Astronomical Complex (CASLEO), at the foot of the Andes Mountains. From there, he made observations of a candidate star of the Disk Detective project.\n\nCredit: Luciano García\n\nWhile in-person opportunities are rare, both virtual and physical events help build community. Citizen scientists stay in touch weekly through various channels.\n\n“Several of us are friends already—after so many years of bad jokes on calls,” said Durantini Luca.\n\n“People send me pictures of how they met,” said Kuchner. He said the program has even changed how he does science. “It’s changed my life,” he said. “Science is already cool—and this makes it even cooler.”\n\nAuthor: Noelia González\n\nLee esta historia en español aquí."}

Through interviews with 11 organizational leaders and an in-depth analysis of sector trends, the research identifies eight major pathways nonprofits and NGOs use to amplify impact while maintaining operational sustainability.\n\n“We hope this research serves as a guide for nonprofit leaders evaluating how to scale their impact while navigating resource constraints,” said co-author Marina Fisher, a Bridgespan partner. “The study underscores that no single approach is universally best; rather, organizations must align their choice of scaling pathways with their expertise, the nature of the problem, and the broader ecosystem working toward social change.\n\nThe research categorizes the eight pathways into three strategic approaches:\n\nSpreading a Solution : Equipping other organizations with proven models or providing direct public access to solutions.\n\n: Equipping other organizations with proven models or providing direct public access to solutions. Changing Enabling Conditions : Influencing public policy, business practices, and societal mindsets to foster systemic change.\n\n: Influencing public policy, business practices, and societal mindsets to foster systemic change. Cultivating Coordinated Action: Mobilizing coalitions, providing shared infrastructure, and empowering communities to drive self-directed change.\n\nThe second article, Three Questions for Nonprofits That Want to Solve Social Problems at Scale, addresses essential strategic questions nonprofit leaders must answer to effectively scale impact:\n\nWhat is the highest-impact role our organization can play? Leaders must identify their organization’s unique contribution within a broader ecosystem of change. Case studies of organizations such as HealthySteps and Tenure Facility highlight how aligning internal expertise with systemic needs can maximize impact.\n\nWhat capabilities and structures are needed to succeed? Effective scaling may require investments in capabilities such as policy advocacy, implementation support, and coalition-building. Examples from Global Fishing Watch, Educate Girls, and Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator demonstrate how organizations can build new competencies to sustain growth.\n\nHow can organizations continuously learn and adapt? As social and political landscapes shift, successful organizations must remain flexible. The research underscores the importance of ongoing measurement, collaboration, and innovation to ensure sustained impact over time. In today’s dynamic political landscape, such adaptation and flexibility are more important than ever.\n\nThe authors acknowledged that there are no easy answers or choices to make on the big questions about an organization’s choice of pathways, capability investments, and adaptation over time.\n\nSaid Bridgespan Manager and report co-author Alyson Zandt, “Indeed, what makes these questions so vital for leaders to focus on is that they all involve making tradeoffs and managing tensions. What unites the most successful organization is their grit to keep going, sometimes in the face of strong headwinds. Solving social problems at scale is a long-term effort, and perseverance can be an organization’s greatest asset.”\n\nAbout Bridgespan\n\nThe Bridgespan Group (www.bridgespan.org) is a global nonprofit that collaborates with social change organizations, philanthropists, and impact investors to make the world more equitable and just.

Several years ago, I received two classic book series from the late Kay Cassill, former director of the now dismantled Twins Foundation, in Providence, Rhode Island—the Bobbsey Twins, by Laura Lee Hope, and the Sweet Valley Twins, by Francine Pascal. The Bobbsey Twins series includes 72 books, written between 1904 and 1979. I acquired 131 of these volumes, but with duplicates, some unique copies are missing. The Sweet Valley Twins series includes 118 books, written between 1986 and 1998. I have 37 Sweet Valley books that include 26 unique copies, six are larger super editions. Both series were aimed at readers between 8 and 12 years of age. (See the captivating covers of these titles on the websites cited in the reference section.)\n\nThe foci of the Bobbsey Twins stories were two opposite-sex pairs born to the same family. They were Nan and Bert, age 12, and Flossie and Freddie, age 6. I was an avid reader of this series in middle school, but was unaware of its fascinating origins. I have since learned that these books were created by Edward Stratemeyer (1862-1930), an author and book packager. A book packager is a publishing company that creates book content, with the efforts of freelance writers and in-house editors (McKean, 2023). Interestingly, Stratemeyer wrote the first book in the Bobbsey Twins series under the pseudonym Laura Lee Hope. However, the other books were the work of ghostwriters working under the Stratemeyer Syndicate.\n\nStratemeyer was the father of daughters, Harriet and Edna, born two and a half years apart. Perhaps seeing the sisters together reminded him of twins, and or the public’s fascination with the subject, explaining why he developed a series on twins. His daughters managed the syndicate after he died in 1930, although their business relationship was not always harmonious.\n\nThe Bobbsey Twins books are known for possibly having the longest publication run of Stratmeyer’s children’s novels. The plots in the Bobbsey Twins books appealed to children younger than 8; however, the required reading level was higher, so parents or older siblings often read these books aloud.\n\nThe Sweet Valley Twins follows the lives of adolescent identical female twins, Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield, who did everything together until they entered Sweet Valley Middle School. The idea for this series came from an editor’s suggestion that the author, Francine Pascal, create a “teenage version of Dallas [the popular television series about the Ewing family that aired between 1978 and 1991.” Pascal focused her stories on twins because “everyone is always fascinated by twins!” She admitted that she always had a fascination with twins. Unfortunately, she asked readers to think of the twins, Elizabeth and Jessica, as the good and bad sides of a single person. Her words probably reflect the beliefs of many, especially during the release of the books, when less was known about twins’ behaviors. Her comment is especially damaging because it fuels the erroneous notion that each identical twin in a pair is part of a larger whole, denying each twin their individuality. Most psychologists today would not endorse such a belief.\n\nIt is worth asking why these two series were so popular among young readers. There were many series to choose from that involved captivating non-twins, yet the Bobbsey Twins and Sweet Valley Twins were among the most popular books and are still being discussed today. The general appeal of twins is largely responsible for the success of these series. Most people are curious about the similarities, differences, and relationship qualities that twins share, and these books offered opportunities for children to witness twins’ lives up close. In addition, male-female twins rarely received the attention that identical twins attracted—even among today’s investigators—so the Bobbsey Twins series was probably welcomed by twin brothers and sisters, their families, and those who knew them. The presence of two sets in the same family also lent an interesting and realistic angle to the stories.\n\nThere are other twin-based series. Lucy Fitch Perkins authored a series from 1911 to 1991 that followed twins from around the world. For example, her titles include The Filipino Twins, The Eskimo Twins, The Indian Twins, The Belgian Twins, The Puritan Twins, and two volumes of The Scotch Twins. Each novel features a pair of male-female twins from a particular country. I suspect that she chose male-female pairs to increase the readership.\n\nI am impressed when twins and their situations are truthfully presented in film and other media. The original movie, The Parent Trap, premiered in 1961 and was hugely successful. This fictional film told the story of young identical female twins who were raised apart from an early age when their parents separated. The girls, unaware of their twinship, met by chance at a summer camp, recognized their physical similarity, compared their life histories, realized they were twins, and changed places at the end of the summer. This film was likely popular because the story and the characters are believable—several reunited twins in the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart met by chance. While none of the twins switched places, a pair of reared-apart twin firemen, Mark and Jerry, did substitute for one another (briefly, but successfully) when Jerry met Mark’s father for the first time (Segal, 2007, 2012). In contrast, the popular Patty Duke Show (1963-1966) portrayed “identical cousins,” a situation that is biologically impossible even if both sets of parents are identical twins. The children delivered by two genetically identical couples would be biologically equivalent to full siblings.\n\nI favor extended television and podcast series addressing the psychological, physical, and medical issues twins raise and what twin studies tell non-twins about human behavior and development. There are many topics, such as varieties of twin types, genetics of twinning, and twins with different fathers, that would both enlighten and entertain audiences. Moreover, human interest stories about twins appear in the popular media regularly. These stories, as well as cutting-edge research, will hopefully inspire scientific-artistic collaborations that will deliver new knowledge and new ideas in a meaningful and enjoyable way.\n\nA longer version of this essay will appear in a forthcoming issue of the professional journal Twin Research and Human Genetics."}

He also issued decrees to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on climate and the World Health Organization, amongst other international forums.\n\nTrump continued to double down on a series of unconventional foreign policy proposals: taking over the Panama Canal, annexing Greenland, making Canada the 51st US state and “owning” Gaza.\n\nAnd despite promising to be a “peace” president, Trump has said he intends to take the US annual Pentagon budget to a record $1 trillion.\n\nHe has distanced himself from neo-conservative foreign policy and does not position himself as a promoter of human rights or democracy abroad. His “America First” stance and scepticism of NATO align with realist principles, but his impulsiveness and highly personalised diplomacy diverge from traditional realism.\n\nAt the same time, he has not called for a full military or diplomatic retreat from global affairs, setting him apart from isolationists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what exactly drives Trump’s foreign policy?\n\nExperts say it is primarily fuelled by a dissatisfaction with the current global system, which he sees as unfairly disadvantaging the US with its rules and restrictions. Instead, Trump appears to want Washington to leverage its enormous military and economic power to set the rules to assert global dominance while reducing US contributions and commitments to others.\n\n“The Trump doctrine is ‘smash and grab’, take what you want from others and let your allies do the same,” said Josh Ruebner, a lecturer at Georgetown University’s Program on Justice and Peace.\n\n‘Just tearing down’\n\nMathew Burrows, programme lead of the Strategic Foresight Hub at the Stimson Center think tank, said Trump wants US primacy without paying the costs that come with that.\n\n“He’s withdrawing the US from the rest of the world, particularly economically,” Burrows, a veteran of the US Department of State and CIA, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“But at the same time, he somehow believes that the US … will be able to tell other countries to stop fighting, to do whatever the US wants,” he said. “Hegemony just doesn’t work that way.”\n\nTrump appears to believe that threatening and imposing tariffs – and occasionally violence – is a way of employing US leverage to get world leaders to acquiesce to his demands.\n\nBut critics say the US president discounts the power of nationalism in other countries, which prompts them to eventually fight back. Such was the case for Canada.\n\nAfter Trump imposed tariffs and called for Canada to become the 51st state, this led to a wave of nationalist pride in the northern neighbour and an abrupt shift from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Canada to China, foreign governments have accused Trump of “bullying” and blackmail.\n\nSome of Trump’s Democratic rivals have rushed to accuse him of abandoning the US global role, but at the same time, the US president has been projecting American strength to pressure other countries.\n\nWhile not entirely isolationist, his approach marks a significant turn from that of his predecessor.\n\nThe late Secretary of State Madeleine Albright famously said in 1998: “We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future.”\n\nThat purported power and wisdom, as Albright envisioned, put the US in a position to implement Pax Americana – the concept of a peaceful global order led by Washington.\n\nTrump does see the US as proverbially taller than other nations, but perhaps not in the way Albright meant.\n\n“America does not need other countries as much as other countries need us,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier this month.\n\nHer statement, however, was to stress that other nations must negotiate with the US to avoid Trump’s tariffs.\n\nIn this context, Trump is seeking revenues and jobs – not an international system governed by liberal values in the way that Washington defines them.\n\nHowever, Burrows said the chief aim of Trump’s foreign policy is to dismantle the existing global order.\n\n“A big part of his world view is really his negative feelings towards the current order, where others appear to be rising,” Burrows said. “And so, a lot of this is just tearing down.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe global order\n\nMuch of the system that manages relations between different countries was put in place after World War II, with the US leading the way.\n\nThe United Nations and its agencies, the articles of international law, various treaties on the environment, nuclear proliferation and trade, and formal alliances have governed global affairs for decades.\n\nCritics of Washington point out that the US violated and opted out of the system where it saw fit.\n\nFor example, the US never joined the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court in 1998. It invaded Iraq in 2003 without United Nations Security Council authorisation in an apparent breach of the UN Charter. And it has been providing unconditional support to Israel despite the US ally’s well-documented abuses against Palestinians.\n\n“The United States has done a lot to stand up sort of multilateral institutions – the UN and others – that are based around these ideas,” said Matthew Duss, the executive vice president at the Center for International Policy.\n\n“But the United States has always found ways to violate these norms and laws when it when it serves our purposes,” he added, pointing to former US President Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza and President George W Bush’s policies after the 9/11 attacks, which included extraordinary rendition, torture, invasion and prolonged occupation.\n\nBut for Trump and his administration, there are indications that the global order is not just to be worked around; it needs to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The post-war global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” Trump’s Secretary of State Marco Rubio told senators during his confirmation hearing in January.\n\nPolitics of grievance\n\nTrump recently told Time Magazine that the US has been “ripped off” by “almost every country in the world”.\n\nHis rhetoric on foreign policy appears to echo his statements about promising to look after “America’s forgotten men and women” who have been mistreated by the “elites” domestically.\n\nWhile the modern world order has empowered US companies and left the country with immense wealth and military and diplomatic might, Americans do have major issues to complain about.\n\nGlobalisation saw the outsourcing of US jobs to countries with less expensive labour. Past interventionist policies – particularly the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – are largely seen as strategic blunders that produced a generation of veterans with physical and mental injuries.\n\nGeoffrey Kabaservice, vice president of political studies at the Niskanen Center, a centre-right think tank in Washington, DC, noted that wages have stagnated for many Americans for decades.\n\n“The fact is that the benefits of globalisation were very maldistributed, and some people up at the top made enormous plutocratic sums of money, and very little of that flowed down to the mass of the working class,” Kabaservice told Al Jazeera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor people who saw their factories closed and felt like they were living in “left-behind areas”, electing Trump was “retribution” against the system, Kabaservice said, adding that Trump’s “America First” approach has pitted the US against the rest of the world.\n\n“America is turning its back on the world,” Kabaservice said. “Trump believes that America can be self-sufficient in all things, but already the falsity of this doctrine is proving true.”\n\nTrita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think tank that promotes diplomacy, said Trump’s foreign policy, including his approach to allies, comes from “the politics of grievance”.\n\n“He does believe that the United States – because of its role as world policeman, which he’s not necessarily in love with – has been shouldering a lot of the security burden of the world without getting proper compensation,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe US president has been calling on NATO allies to increase their defence spending, while suggesting that Washington should be paid more for stationing troops in allied countries like Germany and South Korea.\n\nNostalgia\n\nSo how does Trump view the world?\n\n“He’s an aggressive unilateralist, and in many ways, he’s just an old-school imperialist,” Duss said of Trump. “He wants to expand American territory. He wants to extract wealth from other parts of the world … This is a kind of foreign policy approach from an earlier era.”\n\nHe noted that Trump’s foreign policy is to act aggressively and unilaterally to achieve what he sees as US interests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKabaservice said Trump wants the US to return to an age when it was a manufacturing powerhouse and not too involved in the affairs of the world.\n\n“He likes the idea that maybe the United States is a great power, sort of in a 19th-century model, and it lets the other great powers have their own sphere of influence,” he said.\n\nKabaservice added that Trump wants the US to have “its own sphere of influence” and to be “expanding in the way that optimistic forward-moving powers are”.\n\nThis notion of an America with its own “sphere of influence” appeared to be supported by Rubio when he spoke earlier this year of the inevitability of “multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet”.\n\nParsi said that Trump is seeking hemispheric hegemony above all, despite his aversion for regime change – hence his emphasis on acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal.\n\n“You’re shifting not from the politics of domination towards restraint; you’re shifting from the politics of global domination to a more limited form of domination,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Focus only on your own hemisphere.”\n\nThe US may have already experienced what happens when these views of nostalgia and grievance see real-world implications. Trump’s erratic trade policy rocked the US stock market and sparked threats of counter-levies from Canada to the European Union to China.\n\nEventually, Trump postponed many of his tariffs, keeping a baseline of 10 percent levies and additional importing fees on Chinese goods. Asked why he suspended the measures, the US president acknowledged that it was due to how the tariffs were received. “People were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, Trump’s unilateralism and unpredictability have “broken the world’s trust in significant ways” that will outlast his presidency, Kabaservice told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In the broad span of history, Trump will be seen as the person who committed terrible unforced errors that led to the end of the American century and the beginning of the Chinese century,” he said.\n\nDuring his inauguration speech earlier this year, the US president said his legacy “will be that of a peacemaker and unifier”.\n\n“His actual legacy will be that he has torn down the global system that the US created,” said Burrows, of the Stimson Center."}
