I was surprised at how much I love it.", "fullContent": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nIt wasn't intentional, but it's been two years since I've worked a full-time job.\n\nWhen asked what I do, I stumble over my words. I write articles occasionally as a freelance journalist, but I can't sugarcoat it: I'm a stay-at-home mom. Even typing it, I cringe a little.\n\nBefore becoming a stay-at-home, I saw my friends who were well-off and stay-at-home moms. Their days seemed to be all about lunches and playing tennis.\n\nI was judgmental, for sure. I used to think, \"Must be nice.\"\n\nNow I know — yes, it is nice, but it's also a very challenging job.\n\nMy life took an unexpected turn after getting pregnant\n\nWhen I was 25, I moved to Los Angeles with big dreams of working in Hollywood as a sitcom writer. That didn't pan out, but I did meet my husband.\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, it was even harder to find a steady job in television so I took a position in podcasting. I was there a little over a year but left when things went south — the company declared bankruptcy a few months later. I was also newly pregnant.\n\nI didn't look for a new full-time job while pregnant. Becoming a sitcom writer had been an uphill battle and one I was ready to give up. I took a few short-term contract positions, and after giving birth to my son, I wasn't working at all.\n\nWhen I finally started to consider working again, there'd been a shift in the podcasting openings I found — many producer roles also required editing experience, which wasn't a skill I had or was interested in.\n\nSince becoming a mother, I can't seem to find a career path that excites me\n\nI'm a self-admitted lost soul when it comes to a career. I still look for jobs and often apply.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nHowever, when I really think about what it would mean to take any of the jobs I apply for, sadness washes over me at the thought of being away from my son.\n\nMaybe it's time to accept what I do feel passionate about: my son.\n\nAlso, if I returned to work I would need to find childcare since a day job would likely go to 5 p.m. and my son is out of preschool by 3 p.m. Plus, my son only goes to preschool three days a week.\n\nWhether it's day care or a nanny, the amount of money it would cost makes taking any job less appealing. It's just not worth it.\n\nIf I had a clear career trajectory, it might be a different story.\n\nI was surprised that I enjoy being a stay-at-home mom\n\nI was with my son every single day until he started preschool at 1 ½ years old. I was there for all the milestones: first word, steps, giggles.\n\nI was amazed at how this helpless being transformed into a chatty toddler, full of personality, right before my eyes. Though cliché, it was true: The days are long but the years are short.\n\nOf course, some days are just hard. His naps offer me a much-needed break but then sometimes they don't happen. Food gets thrown on the just-washed floor. If he doesn't have a cold, then he has a stomach bug. It feels like a week without an illness is a rarity.\n\nEven now that's he in school part time, my hours alone fly by, and I never accomplish all the to-dos I hope to. At 3 p.m. I switch back to mom duty and I must entertain him, keep him away from the remote (although sometimes you just have to put on the TV), and manage his multistep bedtime routine.\n\nEven with all the trying moments, I've realized I'm the happiest I've ever been. My son makes me laugh constantly, and I can't tell him enough how much I love him.\n\nI am privileged that my family can afford to live on my husband's salary alone. An additional salary would certainly be helpful, but the opportunity cost of me finding work — and not spending my days with my son — is too high.\n\nMy name may not be in the credits of your favorite comedy show, but I know people whose names are and I wouldn't trade places with any of them.\n\nAlthough my days may not be glamorous and are often monotonous, I love my life as a stay-at-home mom."}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nEntrepreneurs John Coogan and Jordi Hays appeared in a YouTube video last October in rumpled T-shirts. For an hour, they riffed on the week's tech news and launched their talk show, \"Technology Brothers,\" with an unapologetic swagger.\n\nCoogan, who cofounded the once-hyped meal replacement startup Soylent, and Hays, the cofounder of a fundraising startup, have since ditched the tech bro T-shirts for crisp suits, big personalities, and even bigger hair. Their daily show, now rebranded as \"TBPN,\" short for the \"Technology Business Programming Network,\" has evolved into a sports talk show-like livestream where tech founders and investors call in for 15-minute interview slots.\n\n\"The name 'tech bros' had been a slur, right?\" Hays told Business Insider. \"We wanted to reclaim that word in a fun way by saying, 'No, we're not tech bros — we're technology brothers.'\"\n\nSo far, the show's guest list has included star venture capitalists like Keith Rabois, Trae Stephens, and Garry Tan, as well as Plaid CEO Zach Perret and Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen. In just a few months, \"TBPN\" has amassed a few thousand YouTube subscribers while publishing daily on Spotify and Apple Podcasts. Its X account has nearly 40,000 followers.\n\nThe duo's calculated charisma has sparked a social storm because of its redux of the podcast, a played-out format in tech and venture capital. Many main character-coded investors and tech luminaries have podcasts of their own — from Harry Stebbings' \"The Twenty Minute VC\" to the \"All-In Podcast,\" where Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg hold court online.\n\nFans of the show are also driving \"TBPN\"'s fame: \"None of the men posting these have the courage to call @johncoogan and @jordihays hot outright,\" Erika Bricky, who works at a fintech startup, wrote on X. \"Which is actually what we've been missing in tech pod hosts.\"\n\nNot just another tech podcast\n\nCoogan has \"never really had a real full time job,\" he said, but has built a roster of companies. In 2013, Coogan cofounded Soylent, which quickly amassed a cult following. After Soylent, he cofounded Lucy, which makes nicotine gum and pouches. He's also an entrepreneur in residence at Peter Thiel's Founders Fund.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n\"TBPN\" isn't Coogan's first time running a tech media playbook. He skims The Wall Street Journal in print while lounging in his gym's sauna every morning and channeled that ritual into content during the pandemic with a news-driven YouTube channel that has nearly half a million subscribers.\n\nIn college, Hays built a YouTube ad network to help podcasts monetize. He then started fintech company Party Round, later renamed Capital, which helped startup founders raise money. Capital was acquired by the business banking platform Rho in 2023. Hays also angel invests in early-stage startups and advises others, like Coogan's Lucy.\n\nThe pair decided to take their idea for a founder-friendly talk show more seriously late last year. \"We were joking that technology needs a podcast,\" Coogan said. \"Because, obviously, there's a ton.\"\n\nTwo months after their first episode in October 2024, Coogan and Hays were uploading three episodes a week.\n\nIn January, they began featuring guests and moved to broadcasting every weekday. Episodes are shot live, and interviews with founders are unedited. On a good day, like last week's defense tech-focused show, \"TBPN\" interviews 10 people, though usually they average four to six guests. Coogan and Hays also react to articles of interest, like an Economist story on defense tech's rise in Silicon Valley.\n\n\"TBPN\" has not raised any money from venture investors and doesn't plan to, Coogan said. The company relies on advertising revenue from sponsors like fintech company Ramp and bed cooling system startup Eight Sleep.\n\nThe show currently runs lean, with a small crew of editors and three full-time staffers who handle production. Coogan said that, in a bid to level up its content, \"TBPN\" is close to signing a lease on a Hollywood soundstage.\n\n'Digitally-native news anchors'\n\nPerhaps \"TBPN\" has gained appeal because Coogan and Hays are both investors and operators, David Zagaynov, cofounder and CEO of Poseidon Aerospace, wrote to BI in an email. He appeared on \"TBPN\" on April 1, the day after his company launched out of stealth.\n\nAlthough \"TBPN\" is relatively new to the tech podcast scene, a guest appearance has become a signal to some in the startup ecosystem: \"I now only respond to VC cold emails/DMs if they've been on @tbpn,\" Cy Sack, head of business systems at Anduril, wrote on X. \"Serious alpha,\" Seven Seven Six investor Alexis Ohanian, who has been on the show, responded.\n\nCoogan and Hays don't pretend to be journalists. They think of themselves as \"digitally-native news anchors,\" Hays said.\n\nThey aren't venture capitalists either (though they do occasionally angel invest). While some of their tech brethren have raised funds off their podcast momentum (Stebbings, for example, started 20VC's fund in 2020 after his podcast took off), the pair has different intentions.\n\n\"We want to do what we're doing now for decades,\" Hays said. \"We're not doing this so that in a year we can raise a fund.\""}

But seeing as the last one dates back to September of last year, I’m well off that mark and figured it’s high time to put pen to paper. The fact is that a lot is happening around here at CSS-Tricks — and it’s all good stuff.\n\nThe Almanac is rolling\n\nIn the last post of 2024, I said that filling the Almanac was a top priority heading into this year. We had recently refreshed the whole dang thing, complete with completely new sections for documenting CSS selectors, at-rules, and functions on top of the sections we already had for properties and pseudo-selectors. The only problem is that those new sections were pretty bare.\n\nWell, not only has this team stepped up to produce a bunch of new content for those new sections, but so have you. Together, we’ve published 21 new Almanac entries since the start of 2025. Here they are in all their glory:\n\nWhat’s even better? There are currently fourteen more in the hopper that we’re actively working on. I certainly do not expect us to sustain this sort of pace all year. A lot of work goes into each and every entry. Plus, if all we ever did was write in Almanac, we would never get new articles and tutorials out to you, which is really what we’re all about around here.\n\nA lot of podcasts and events\n\nThose of you who know me know that I’m not the most social person in all the land. Yes, I like hanging out with folks and all that, but I tend to keep my activities to back-of-the-house stuff and prefer to stay out of view.\n\nSo, that’s why it’s weird for me to call out a few recent podcast and event appearances. It’s not like I do these things all that often, but they are fun and I like to note them, even if its only for posterity.\n\nI hosted Smashing Meets Accessibility, a mini online conference that featured three amazing speakers talking about the ins and outs of WCAG conformance, best practices, and incredible personal experiences shaped by disability.\n\nI hosted Smashing Meets CSS, another mini conference from the wonderful Smashing Magazine team. I got to hang out with Adam Argyle, Julia Micene, and Miriam Suzanne, all of whom blew my socks off with their presentations and panel discussion on what’s new and possible in modern CSS.\n\nI’m co-hosting a brand-new podcast with Brad Frost called Open Up! We recorded the first episode live in front of an audience that was allowed to speak up and participate in the conversation. The whole idea of the show is that we talk more about the things we tend to talk less about in our work as web designers and developers — the touchy-feely side of what we do. We covered so many heady topics, from desperation during layoffs to rediscovering purpose in your work.\n\nI was a guest on the Mental Health in Tech podcast, joining a panel of other front-enders to discuss angst in the face of recent technological developments. The speed and constant drive to market new technologies is dizzying and, to me at least, off-putting to the extent that I’ve questioned my entire place in it as a developer. What a blast getting to return to the podcast a second time and talk shop with a bunch of the most thoughtful, insightful people you’ll ever hear. I’ll share that when it’s published.\n\nA new guide on styling counters\n\nWe published it just the other week! I’ll be honest and say that a complete guide about styling counters in CSS was not the first thing that came to my mind when we started planning new ideas, but I’ll be darned if Juan didn’t demonstrate just how big a topic it is. There are so many considerations when it comes to styling counters — design! accessibility! semantics! — and the number of tools we have in CSS to style them is mind-boggling, including two functions that look very similar but have vastly different capabilities for creating custom counters — counter() and counters() (which are also freshly published in the Almanac).\n\nAt the end of last year, I said I hoped to publish 1-2 new guides, and here we are in the first quarter of 2025 with our first one out in the wild! That gives me hope that we’ll be able to get another comprehensive guide out before the end of the year.\n\nAuthors\n\nI think the most exciting update of all is getting to recognize the folks who have published new articles with us since the last update. Please help me extend a huge round of applause to all the faces who have rolled up their sleeves and shared their knowledge with us.\n\nAnd, of course, nothing on this site would be possible without ongoing help from Juan Diego Rodriguez and Ryan Trimble. Those two not only do a lot of heavy lifting to keep the content machine fed, but they are also just two wonderful people who make my job a lot more fun and enjoyable. Seriously, guys, you mean a lot to this site and me!"}

Firstly, the juvenile Mussolinis who monopolised the Blue Blur himself in the callously-defined \"single player\" mode, and secondly, the absolute saints and/or craven appeasers who consented to be Sonic's sidekick Tails, and had to spend the whole run struggling to keep pace with the Sonic player's camera.\n\nTails in Sonic 2 \"single player\" is a grieving immortal, his soul lashed to the wheel of Sonic's whirling footsteps, doomed to respawn indefinitely until his prickly tormentor finally exhausts their shared stock of lives. Yours was an existence doled out in offscreen \"du-dum\" noises, as poor Tails ran half-knowingly into any spikes or Robotnik creations eclipsed by the Sonic player's passage. Yes, I'm aware there was an actual splitscreen mode, but let's be honest with ourselves, 30 years on - it made your TV look like a mitotic error.\n\nSonic players will look at the just-announced multiplayer platform game SpeedRunners 2: King Of Speed and see only another checkerboard mountain of astroturf to conquer. Tails players will look at it and see an opportunity to put everything they've learned from those Mega Drive humiliations to the test. For SpeedRunners 2 is a game about a bunch of Tails players competing to be Sonic.\n\nI apologise if I'm making too big a fuss of the SpeedRunners concept. I missed the first one, which came out in the 2010s, and which we have covered in no less than five seperate feature articles. In any case, the apposite comparisons here are probably Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Trials and The Flash.\n\nIn SpeedRunners 2, up to eight superheroes sprint through 2D spy-fi levels, striving to be the last remaining character on screen. You've got base movement mechanics such as wall-kicking and a grapple hook, plus power-ups such as missiles, traps and freeze rays with which to Blue Shell the other players into screeching submission. The levels include terrain fixtures such as ceilings you can swing from and boost pads. It all looks slick, jolly and decently nail-biting.\n\n\"The original multiplayer gameplay formula of SpeedRunners is timeless, unofficially dubbed as the 'Mario Kart of 2D platformers',\" comments the Steam page. \"With the sequel, our goal is to carefully bring this unique 'SpeedRunners feel' into the new era without compromising on the depth and fluidity of the movement system while still keeping it easy to grasp. On top of that, King of Speed introduces vibrant high-definition graphics and improved netcode.\"\n\nThe game launches later this year. Speaking as a recovering Tails player, I am reasonably stoked. The only thing the trailer seems to be missing is that little intangible margin of error around the screen in Sonic 2 - that Last Chance Saloon from which the double-tufted fox might heroically scoot back into visibility."}

Witnessing a despicable human being carrying out acts that shall not be mentioned here.\n\n#1 Racist Karen Leaves A Message (Not Mine) Share icon\n\nRELATED:\n\n#2 I Had To Evacuate From The Wildfires In LA Share icon Had 30 minutes to leave my home. When my manager called me and asked if I remembered my work laptop. I said no I was fleeing for my life she sent this message to our group.\n\n\n\n#3 Artificially Obsolete Share icon\n\nSome of us manage our anger well. And some of us really don’t. It all comes down to emotional regulation. And sometimes, our current mood or the way our day is going, or not going, can play a part in whether we want to roll our eyes at something, or punch the wall in a fit of rage. Not advised. ADVERTISEMENT Anger is a completely normal, human emotion. We are meant to feel it, in healthy doses. Lest we bottle everything up and one day explode like a pressure cooker. It's how you manage the infuriating moments that matters. Not controlling your anger can cause destruction that'll have a negative impact on your daily life, personal relationships, work, mental health and general wellbeing.\n\n#4 280+ Year Old Tree In My Town Cut Down To Build Chick-Fil-A Share icon\n\n#5 Found On Mildlyinfuriating. Nothing Mild About This Share icon\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#6 This Cat Left In A Cage On The Side Of The Road Share icon\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere's a whole lot happening in our bodies when we get mildly annoyed or highly p*ssed off. According to the American Psychological Association, just like other emotions, anger is accompanied by physiological and biological changes. When your blood boils, so to speak, your heart rate and blood pressure go up, as do the levels of your energy hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline.\n\n#7 Are You Being Serious? Share icon\n\n#8 How Does This Even Happen???? Share icon\n\n#9 People Suck Share icon\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDr Jerry Deffenbacher is a psychologist who specializes in anger management. The expert says some people are more “hotheaded” than others are. Basically, they get angry more easily and more intensely than the average person does. Think about how different people react to someone cutting in front of them in traffic. One might shrug it off and turn the soothing music up. Another might fly into a fit of rage and jump out of their car wielding a baseball bat.\n\n#10 Got This Frantic Text Early In The Morning. Dad Has My Back.

Easily angered people don’t always curse and throw things, says Deffenbacher. Sometimes they withdraw socially, sulk, or even get physically ill. You tolerance to highly infuriating situations might be genetic. The APA notes that previous research has revealed that some babies are \"born irritable, touchy, and easily angered, and that these signs are present from a very early age.\"\n\n#16 This Is Beyond F**kedup Share icon\n\n#17 Moving Horror Share icon We moved from Nebraska to Maryland and hired a company to move us. They didn't have a big enough truck so we had to throw away some of our stuff and leave behind some things like my husband's big work bench. It took 3 weeks to get to us and we only got back 1/3 of our entire 2 bedroom apartment. I've spent days crying over this. I paid them $3,000. They told me to file a claim but without receipts to prove what we bought they would deny it immediately, that is exactly what the representative on the phone said.\n\n\n\nWe lost SO MUCH! That wooden chest was handmade by my husband's great grandpa and it's DESTROYED!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#18 How On Earth Are Disposable Vapes With Lithium Batteries Legal? Share icon\n\nThe way we are brought up, or who and what we are exposed to can also play a part. Some of us are taught that anger is is negative and we shouldn't express it. We therefore don't learn to channel our anger properly. Others learn that it's okay to show your emotions. Whether they be anger, sadness, or pure joy. And they also learn to regulate their emotions so that they don't have big outbursts. The APA's site reveals that people who are easily angered often come from families that are \"disruptive, chaotic, and not skilled at emotional communications.\"\n\n#19 I Beg Your Finest F*****g Pardon, That's Not How This Works Share icon\n\n#20 I Was In Mexico And I Saw This.

When you choose a language, you may get a different one.\n\nMicrosoft says that the Office Team has fixed the problem, but the fix won’t roll out until Monday, April 14, 2025.

In addition to Visual Suite 2.0, the company has added coding, spreadsheets, and graphs to its AI capabilities. It’s a rather sharp change for Canva—although if a social media company like Facebook can toss its brand identity aside for a failed run at the metaverse, then why can’t Canva try its own hand at its own pivot?\n\nCanva’s shift toward the spreadsheet actually makes sense, according to the company. “While data is a critical part of visual communication, whether it’s creating charts, forms, reports, dashboards, or infographics, it’s also complex and disconnected from the creative process,” Melanie Perkins, the chief executive of Canva, said in a blog post.\n\nThe snippet of video that shows off what’s being called “Canva Sheets” is impressive: not only are Canva’s Sheets visually bright and dynamic, but Canva has included so-called “Magic Insights” and “Magic Formulas.” Instead of simply fishing around to create a formula, you can enter it in natural language and Canva’s AI will come up with the formula and apply it for you. It’s a reminder that Microsoft Excel—for all of the power it offers and its installed base—just isn’t as visually appealing.\n\nCanva Sheets offers a sharp break from the staid Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Canva\n\nCanva, which can import files from Excel, is designed to tell visual stories. It’s free to use, though syncing with your brand logo or storing more than 5GB within Canva’s cloud will cost extra.\n\nCanva Sheets and the related Charts app are designed to tell visual stories, Canva says. Like Excel, you can highlight data and Canva Charts will recommend one or a series of charts. Again, though, they’re bright and dynamic—something that Excel really isn’t.\n\nCanva didn’t say when these features would arrive, but some of the graphics indicate that they’re “coming soon.”\n\nCanva’s Magic Charts, which tries to suggest visually interesting ways to present your data. Canva\n\nCanva says that both Sheets and Charts can be integrated with other features offered by Canva, such as the AI-powered Magic Write feature to fill in blanks or holes in existing copy.\n\nAnd then there’s Canva AI, which is what other companies might call an LLM or chatbot. Within Canva, it appears ready to be a design assistant. In one example, a user could upload a photo and have Canva AI turn it into an Instagram introduction post. A related “Design for me” option helps iterate designs, optionally based on a reference image.\n\nCanva AI tries to assist you with the design process. Canva\n\nIt might seem odd that Canva AI can also generate code, but Canva seems to think that someone like a web designer might use it to code an element or widget rather than duck out to use another program.\n\nCanva’s hope is that you’ll use Visual Suite 2.0 as a jumping-off point for this, moving back and forth between various design types to create what you need. There’s even a new photo editor, with a way to take an object and inject it into an AI-generated background while maintaining lighting.\n\nCanva’s new photo editor in action. Canva\n\n“Whether you’re brainstorming on a whiteboard, mapping out your strategy in a doc, or building a campaign across slides, spreadsheets, and socials, everything lives in one place,” Perkins wrote. “This is more than just convenience; it’s a whole new way to work.”"}

The AI-powered feature periodically “reads” your on-screen activity and saves each moment as a series of searchable screenshots. If you’re interested, the Recall feature is rolling out to the Windows Insider Release Preview channel now.\n\nYou’ve probably heard a lot about Recall since Microsoft revealed it last year, because, well, there’s a lot to say. Our Windows expert Mark Hachman gave it a thorough test when it hit the Insider Preview Dev channel in December (that’s roughly analogous to an alpha test for Windows 11, versus the Release Preview’s beta test). He found Recall’s performance to be slow and stuttery, though there are a few somewhat comforting nods to the privacy issues, like making you authenticate with Windows Hello whenever you open your own activity history. But the system was inconsistent at best and buggy at worst, and not anywhere near ready to replace, say, a manual screenshot or bookmark you take yourself for referring back to later.\n\nIs that worth the privacy risk of having a huge, visual history of your PC activity, even if you take Microsoft at its word on how secure and safe it is? Well, that’s for you to decide. I imagine enterprise users have expressed distaste, because Microsoft has already confirmed that it’ll be disabled by default on the enterprise version of Windows. If you’re not fond of the idea, Recall can be disabled and removed by regular users, too.\n\nI don’t have a Copilot+ PC handy to test out the new and improved version of Recall on the Insider Release Preview, but you can try it yourself if you’re so inclined. After a disappointing announcement, Microsoft will probably try to get it out to the general Windows 11 user base—again, with the feature only available to PCs and laptops with newer Copilot+ processors—sometime later in 2025."}

When we reviewed it, we gave it a 4.5-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, appreciating its super-thin form factor, IP55 dust and water resistance, and solid performance. “If you want top-flight real-world performance and can’t use, or don’t want to pay for Thunderbolt 3, then the Crucial X10 Pro is what you want.”\n\nThis is a durable, high-capacity, travel-friendly portable SSD that’s perfect for storing data, transferring files, and recording high-res video directly to the drive. And when I say this portable SSD is tiny, I absolutely mean it. It’s smaller than a credit card and it fits right in the palm of your hand. Afraid you’re going to lose it? No worries, because it has a little hole in the corner where you can loop in a lanyard.\n\nGo ahead and snag the Crucial X10 Pro for just $102 while this limited-time deal lasts.

According to Microsoft, the cumulative update fixes several security vulnerabilities in Windows 11 while also introducing some minor improvements.\n\nBut on top of all that, users have spotted a new and rather curious phenomenon: after installing KB5055523 and restarting Windows 11, a new folder called inetpub suddenly appears in the C: drive, which was created by the update. I was personally able to observe this on my own computer after installing update KB5055523.\n\nFoundry\n\nThe inetpub folder is normally created and used by Windows Internet Information Services (IIS), an optional web server by Microsoft that’s integrated into Windows and enables the hosting of websites, apps, and FTP servers directly on a Windows PC. The required web data is subsequently stored in the inetpub folder.\n\nEmphasis on “optional,” though, as IIS isn’t normally installed on Windows 11 Home or Windows 11 Pro and is usually only installed on demand by turning it on via the Windows Features panel:\n\nJoel Lee / Foundry\n\nDid update KB5055523 simply install and activate IIS without my knowledge? The good news is, no, IIS is still disabled. However, according to Microsoft, this is not a bug—it’s intentional. Even though the folder is empty and appears useless, it is there to improve Windows security. As such, you should NOT delete it.\n\n“After installing this update or a later Windows update, a new %systemdrive%\\inetpub folder will be created on your device. This folder should not be deleted regardless of whether Internet Information Services (IIS) is enabled on the target device. This behavior is part of changes that increase protection and does not require any action from IT admins and end users. For more information, see CVE-2025-21204.”\n\nBeyond the inetpub folder mystery, the April update KB5055523 is far from bug-free. Microsoft refers to several known issues on the official support page for the update, including some that affect Roblox as well as Citrix apps and Windows Hello.\n\nGamers using Arm devices are unable to download and play Roblox on Windows from the Microsoft Store, and devices with certain Citrix components installed may not be able to install the January 2025 Windows security update. Microsoft is also investigating issues that are preventing users from signing in with Windows Hello facial recognition or PIN, requiring them to re-register first.\n\nUpdated on April 11, 2025: In the original publishing of this story, we erroneously presumed that the inetpub folder was a bug and could be safely deleted. This turned out to be a mistake. We regret the error and apologize for any confusion."}

Today, that dream is realized, albeit with some limitations. There are plenty of ways to play the very same games, or stream them to the screen in your pocket—and now Razer is offering another one.\n\nRazer PC Remote Play is still marked as beta in the Razer Cortex omnibus application on my PC, and “beta” feels about right. It’s far from a tight, integrated package and feels more like a utilitarian remote access tool with some gaming features—most notably integration with Razer’s Kishi series of phone controller accessories—bolted on. The app can either stream your entire PC display (just one) or create a virtual window for a game (to optimize bandwidth), and it’ll automatically adjust to your phone’s resolution and refresh rate.\n\nWhile you’ll need to be on the same local network as the host PC to initiate the connection, once you’ve set up the connection via your Razer account, it should be possible to play over a mobile connection… but I couldn’t manage it. The PC Remote Play app on my phone identified my host PC at home (right in front of me, but routed through miles of cell towers) but couldn’t establish a connection, let alone attempt streaming.\n\nI get the feeling that most gamers who want to try this app will already have other ways of achieving the same thing, like Steam’s streaming system for going directly to a local PC or Nvidia’s GeForce Now for a more hands-off way of streaming the games you already own. I’m not overly enamored with Razer’s PC software to begin with—the fact that it’s probably the most reliable and stable of the dedicated “driver” programs for game accessories is an indictment on that entire software category, not exactly praise for Razer.\n\nUnless you need direct integration with Razer mobile controllers, notably the Kishi Ultra’s impressive haptic feedback system, I don’t think you need to trouble yourself with setting it up on both PC and Android."}

But if you want some serious polygon-pushing power in a laptop, you’re going to have to part with a few Benjamins. This weekend, you can get an Acer Predator gaming laptop for a few less: it’s up on eBay for $899.99, $600 off the retail price.\n\nA couple of things to know before you hit the buy button. One, this is a refurbished laptop, not new, but it’s being sold directly from Acer’s eBay store and it comes with a two-year warranty—that’s double the coverage you get with a new model. (That said, it comes through Allstate, not Acer itself, which might also have a 30-90 day refurb warranty.) I’ve never had any major issues with manufacturer refurbished electronics, but you have to make this judgment call for yourself.\n\nSecond, I’d say that even with the impressive power of a Core Ultra 7 155H processor and an RTX 4070 discrete graphics card, 16GB of RAM is a little on the paltry side for a gaming laptop this expensive. And unlike some similarly chunky gaming laptops, the memory can’t be upgraded by just popping off the bottom. (You can, however, swap out the 1TB M.2 SSD for something roomier.) That’s a shame, especially if you’re planning on using this as a work or school laptop and want to run tons of browser tabs, but not a deal-breaker if gaming is your only priority.\n\nOther highlights of the Acer Predator Helios Neo 14 (deep breath) include a 14-inch 2560×1600 screen running at 120Hz for competitive online gaming, plenty of ports including USB-C and USB-A on both sides, a microSD card slot, a full-sized HDMI port, and three lighting zones on the backlit keyboard. Note that the screen isn’t touch-enabled, if that’s important to you. The 74 watt-hour battery is beefy, but don’t expect it to last through marathon gaming sessions with those high-powered parts.\n\neBay has this laptop listed for $1,125, but discounted with a limited-time coupon code OUTLET20 for extra savings, bringing it down to $899.99. This code only works through April 14th—and Acer’s stock might run out before then—so get your order in fast if you’re interested.\n\nGet this RTX 4070 gaming laptop for just $900"}

It’s been a dizzying ten days for Americans and the entire world, and even after the Trump White House on Wednesday abruptly paused its plans for a global, “reciprocal” tariff regime, there remains plenty of volatility swirling through the markets (and, ahem, a 145% tariff rate on all Chinese imports). In the midst of the uncertainty, I enjoyed Ben’s article on “American Disruption” : it was a clear-eyed look at what sort of manufacturing should and should not be brought back to the U.S., why the Liberation Day tariffs would be disastrous and counter-productive policy, and what considerations must be accounted for by anyone who’s trying to reorder the system we’ve had for the past 40 years. — AS\n\n\n\nA Complicated Future for Apple. Multinationals all over the world are facing big questions, and Tuesday’s Daily Update was a good glimpse into the challenges ahead for the biggest multinational of them all. Tim Cook’s ability to optimize supply chains and straddle the relationships between the governments of United States and China has been by far his strongest attribute as CEO, and as Ben wrote, the weeks and months ahead will be “an opportunity to earn every dime of his paycheck.” Along these lines, and as context for every other global trade debate you encounter this week, I highly recommend the Sharp Tech deep dive into Cook’s history of building out Apple’s supply chain in China as a keystone to understanding tech manufacturing in Asia more generally. — Daman Rangoola\n\n\n\nThe Other Side of the Trade War. With regard to the tariffs not paused on Wednesday, this week’s episode of Sharp China focused on the Chinese posture in the wake of trade war escalations that were likely never modeled for by Xi Jinping and the PRC. Among the topics: state countermeasures being mooted on the Chinese internet, why CCP leadership may believe that their system can withstand more pain than that of their U.S. counterparts, and an unsettling lack of clarity as to what the PRC could offer to allay American concerns and deescalate tensions. I can’t promise this episode is the most relaxing weekend listening, but it’s great insight into the dynamics that could define the next few months and years of the US-China relationship.

Through this yearlong fellowship, he will cover U.S. military operations, national security issues, and foreign affairs.\n\n“As global power dynamics are being profoundly reshaped, Nick’s work has never been more essential. The Intercept has always questioned mainstream coverage about American military power, and there is no one better than Nick to provide the kind of nuanced, incisive coverage that our readers want and deserve right now,” said CEO Annie Chabel.\n\n“Nick is a thoughtful, thorough, and curious journalist with deep expertise reporting on U.S. military and national security,” said editor-in-chief Ben Muessig. “I look forward to working with him more closely in 2025.”\n\nTurse, who is also a fellow at Type Media Center, has written for The Intercept for a decade, publishing more than 150 articles. He was part of the award-winning team that produced “The Drone Papers,” a cache of secret documents detailing the inner workings of the U.S. military’s assassination program in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia. He received the 2022 Military Reporters & Editors Association Award for Best Overseas Coverage for “The AFRICOM Files,” which revealed how the Pentagon undercounts and ignores military sexual assault in Africa. In 2023, The Intercept published a searing four-article exposé about former U.S. diplomat Henry Kissinger’s direct role in U.S. attacks on Cambodian villages in the 1970s that were previously unknown to the outside world, based on decades of reporting by Turse, who was the first person to interview victims and survivors in 13 villages that suffered relentless attacks. He received the 2024 Deadline Club Award for Reporting by Independent Digital Media for “Kissinger’s Killing Fields.”\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, Turse reported that a 2018 U.S. drone strike in Somalia killed up to five civilians, including a mother and her 4-year-old daughter, and that the Pentagon found no one at fault. Following Turse’s investigation, two dozen human rights organizations and several members of Congress urged then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to compensate the family for the deaths. Turse is a finalist for the 2025 Fetisov Journalism Award for Outstanding Contribution to Peace for this article and several follow-up pieces published this year.\n\n“I am thrilled to be joining The Intercept in this expanded role. Watchdog journalism is more necessary than ever and I can’t think of an outlet more committed to holding power to account,” said Turse. “I’m excited to get started.”\n\nTurse has received a number of honors for his work including a Ridenhour Prize for Investigative Reporting, a James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism, and an I.F. Stone “Izzy” Award for Outstanding Achievement in Independent Journalism. He is a two-time finalist for the American Society of Magazine Editors’ National Magazine Award for Excellence in Reporting.​​ He has a Ph.D. in sociomedical sciences from Columbia University."}

Consumers and PC vendors alike are trying to figure out what it means and how everyone can avoid paying more than they have to.\n\nFortunately, some vendors are starting to come forward and explain how their costs are being affected and how they’re being passed along to you — or not.\n\nPC vendors are just like you, in that they’re buying processors, GPUs, and other components for their products. But while you can track an SSD price as it rises and falls on Amazon, you have no real way of knowing what the future holds. PC vendors do, because they talk to component vendors regularly. Normally, however, they keep these conversations secret.\n\nRecently, two PC vendors, Framework and Puget Systems, have not only begun talking about how tariffs will affect the price of the products that they sell to you, but also about the prices they’re paying for components and whether they’ll go up or down — and by how much. It’s all extremely valuable information, especially if you’re confused about what tariffs will affect which parts inside of a PC. Even better, they’re updating their insights as new info comes in, especially because the expected cost of the tariffs has been vague and changing.\n\nOf course, neither vendor can say for certain what will happen at any moment in time; President Trump has raised and lowered tariffs unexpectedly throughout the past few days. As of press time, tariffs on imported Chinese goods stand at 125 percent, while he has enacted a “pause” on other worldwide tariffs — but they’re still 10 percent, regardless, while the “cheap tariff loophole” has been eliminated, too. And remember, chip tariffs could begin on June 1.\n\nA year ago, no one cared where a PC or a component was made. Now, you absolutely should.\n\nTariff lessons you can learn from Framework\n\nFramework, a modular PC supplier, sources its components from a variety of companies and countries. As a small supplier, the tariffs have hit hard; Framework only recently began allowing customers to pre-order its latest Framework Laptop 12 in the U.S., and earlier “paused” some existing Laptop sales in response to the ongoing tariffs.\n\nNirav Patel, the chief executive and founder of Framework, explained that Framework was originally founded five years ago upon the principle that, eventually, U.S.-China relations would sour, and tariffs would be applied. Framework thus performs much of its assembly in Taiwan.\n\nThe Framework Desktop. Mark Hachman / Foundry\n\nAt Framework, here’s how it breaks down: Framework laptops, desktops, and its mainboards are assembled in Taiwan — subject then to a 32 percent tariff, which has now fallen to 10 percent. Some of its pluggable USB-C modules are made in Taiwan, but the majority are made in China, still subject to a 125 percent tariff. Framework buys Western Digital’s modules from Malaysia (then: 24 percent tariff, now: 10 percent).\n\nFramework’s Patel had some interesting advice for customers looking to buy their tariffed storage: “[We] recommend that you purchase it elsewhere for your DIY Edition if possible, like directly from the Western Digital website.”\n\nThe other lesson? Bye-bye, budget PCs. If low-priced PCs can’t be sold at a high enough profit, PC vendors will withdraw them.\n\n“For our lowest-priced base systems, where we’re unable to absorb the remaining 10 percent tariff, ordering is still paused for US customers,” Framework said. “Many of our modules are manufactured in China, which now face higher tariffs. On these items, we are keeping elevated pricing for now to cover the tariff cost. We’ll continue to monitor this situation and update pricing if needed.”\n\nWhat Puget predicts will happen with PC part pricing\n\nPuget Systems is a smaller boutique workstation vendor, which has published detailed updates on how the tariffs are affecting its own costs and end prices. Puget has also drawn a distinction between directly tariffed goods and indirect tariffs — for example, while DRAM might be manufactured in the United States, the printed circuit board on which it is mounted might ship from China.\n\nHow tariffs will affect Puget Systems, a boutique PC and workstation company. Puget Systems\n\nThe biggest impact, Puget says, will be felt on the most expensive components — with one exception. Processors, both from AMD and Intel, are exempt from the tariffs, apparently because they are officially shipped from the United States. Some video cards are, too.\n\nOn the other hand, demand and prices for Nvidia’s latest GeForce 5090 were already insane, and they’re probably going to get worse. “When a new product is released and in high demand, supply is typically constrained, causing prices to inflate significantly,” Puget president Jon Bach wrote. “The 5090 definitely falls into that camp! I can’t remember a product in recent history that has been in such short supply for so long after launch, and the future doesn’t look much better.”\n\nHere’s how Puget sees the tariff increases affecting the prices of the components it buys. While the actual percentage costs were tied to the earlier, per-country tariffs, you can basically take them as an indicator of how price-sensitive they are.\n\nMotherboards: Puget said on April 1 that it would absorb any price increases in motherboard costs, if only because they come from a variety of countries.\n\nPuget said on April 1 that it would absorb any price increases in motherboard costs, if only because they come from a variety of countries. CPUs: No impact!\n\nNo impact! SSDs: Puget expects prices to climb by 10 percent — but not from tariffs, but from supply constraints.\n\nPuget expects prices to climb by 10 percent — but not from tariffs, but from supply constraints. Memory: Prices were on a downward trend before the tariffs hit, so the price that Puget (or you) pays could remain flat or even slightly dip.\n\nPrices were on a downward trend before the tariffs hit, so the price that Puget (or you) pays could remain flat or even slightly dip. GPUs: An enormous question mark. GPUs were previously tariffed at 20 percent, and this may have already been partially priced in. “This is the worst news in this post because these components have a high cost to begin with, so even a smaller percent increase means a bigger dollar increase!” Bach wrote.\n\nAn enormous question mark. GPUs were previously tariffed at 20 percent, and this may have already been partially priced in. “This is the worst news in this post because these components have a high cost to begin with, so even a smaller percent increase means a bigger dollar increase!” Bach wrote. Network and storage controllers: Puget expects to pay about 20 percent more here, although these would probably be confined to its workstation/rack products.\n\nPuget expects to pay about 20 percent more here, although these would probably be confined to its workstation/rack products. Chassis and power supplies: Puget expects to pay 20 percent more, and it seems reasonable that enthusiasts would too. “Large-scale chassis production almost always comes from China, so our costs are directly impacted,” Bach wrote.\n\nPuget expects to pay 20 percent more, and it seems reasonable that enthusiasts would too. “Large-scale chassis production almost always comes from China, so our costs are directly impacted,” Bach wrote. CPU coolers and fans: Puget’s Bach said that prices of these components should rise by about 20 percent. Fortunately, they’re not that expensive, relatively.\n\nIt’s a hard sell, but you might want to buy now. Puget’s Bach said he expects the Trump chip tariff to kick in on June 1, with potential cost increases of between 20 and 45 percent. Fortunately, Puget is using the “pause” in tariffs to import as much inventory as the company can to stockpile parts in U.S. warehouses before any additional tariffs are implemented again.\n\nFramework gets nerdy about tariffs\n\nSince PC vendors do as much assembly as they do building, how does the government decide which products are tariffed and which aren’t? Framework drew back the curtain to explain how its products were affected. (This might be too much information!)\n\n“When goods are imported into the US, tariffs are assessed based on the country of origin and the HTS (Harmonized Tariff Schedule) code that the goods are classified as,” Framework’s Patel wrote.\n\n“We ship all of our products DDP (Delivered Duty Paid), meaning we pay tariffs as goods clear customs and include the cost inside of our product pricing,” Patel added. “The tariff is calculated against the value of the product at import, meaning our cost as the importer, rather than the final price we charge for the product. The country of origin is defined as the last location in which “substantial transformation” occurs. For computers, US Customs has specifically defined substantial transformation as the location at which the main circuit board is assembled.”\n\nUgh, right? Being a smart PC builder right now means that you might have to take an economics class in your spare time. Hopefully more PC vendors come forward to share what they know."}

Here’s an easy way to find out", "fullContent": "If you’re a smartphone owner—and chances are that’s everyone reading this—you’ve probably encountered an eerie, but all too common scenario: One day you’re talking about a random topic while your phone is next to you and the following day you notice ads start popping up related to that same topic. It’s unsettling. How do these ads know what you were talking about?\n\nYour smartphone may be the culprit. Every smartphone has its built-in microphone constantly turned on in order for the virtual assistant to hear your voice commands. So, could it be that these devices are also secretly eavesdropping on your conversations in order to serve you ads? Here’s everything you need to know, plus a simple test to find out.\n\nHow to find out if your phone is listening to you\n\nTo test if your phone is listening to your conversations, start by openly discussing a unique topic that you’ve never searched for or discussed previously while your phone is turned on next to you. It’s crucial that this be something that isn’t related to your usual interests or search queries.\n\nSpend a day or two discussing this topic out loud with your phone next to you the whole time. Make sure that you don’t search about this topic on any of your devices—not just your phone.\n\nYou can also try talking about specific things related to this topic. For example, if you’re discussing traveling to Spain, you can discuss learning Spanish or what the best restaurant is for paella in Madrid.\n\nDuring this time, pay close attention to the ads you’re served while online—ads on social media feeds, websites you visit, apps you use, and those on your smart TV if you have one. Then, if you begin seeing ads about the topic you chose to discuss, chances are you’ve confirmed the eavesdropping and caught your phone red-handed.\n\nWhat to do if you think your phone is eavesdropping\n\nBefore you go taping over the microphone and camera on your phone or throwing it in a lake, there are a few less drastic things you can do to curb the potential eavesdropping.\n\nThe first is to carefully review the app permissions on your device. It’s likely that you downloaded an app and allowed it to access your microphone without ever realizing it. Comb through the permissions for each app on your phone and limit apps that don’t need access to your microphone, camera, or location settings.\n\nUnder the respective settings menus, you can turn off Google Assistant on Android phones or Siri on iOS devices to make sure they aren’t eavesdropping. Sam Singleton\n\nNext, clear the voice history and disable your phone’s digital assistant. Google, Siri, and Alexa are all very convenient, but might be actively (and passively) recording everything you say without you knowing.\n\nJust last year, 404 Media reported that a third-party company named Cox Media Group (CMG), which offers “Active Listening” technology, was working with companies such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.\n\nWhile these companies have since denied using this technology to spy on phone users, the fact is that the capabilities exist and it’d be foolish to assume that companies wouldn’t take advantage of ways to more effectively advertise to consumers—after all, ads drive most of their revenue.\n\nFinally, while companies are the most likely source of eavesdropping, there is always the potential for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities on your device and take control of the microphone or camera as well. The best way to combat this is to make sure you always have the latest updates for both your phone’s OS and all of the installed apps.\n\nAll of these steps will help cut off unwanted access to your phone’s microphone, but if you’re still unsure, there’s a simple solution. Just turn off your phone or leave it behind when you want to discuss private matters. It’s the best way to ensure your phone can’t hear you.\n\nIf your phone isn’t listening, then how’s it getting your data?\n\nWhile the prospect of your phone constantly eavesdropping on your every conversation may be disconcerting, there are myriad ways that you could be divulging this same info without ever saying it out loud.\n\nEach smartphone is a veritable treasure trove of personal data for any and all apps to pull from. They are essentially mini-computers packed with sensors: gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, and just about any other -meter you can think of. The data collected from these sensors can provide a shocking amount of info about our routines, habits, and personalities.\n\nEverywhere you visit, other people you talk to or spend time with, lifestyle choices, and personal health data are just some of the metadata and telemetry—phone sensor data—collected by your phone. Not to mention all of the vast amounts of data you’ve already provided over the years to your apps and via Google searches.\n\nYour phone and the installed apps hoover up all of this data and send it off to third parties such as data brokers to be analyzed, sold, and regurgitated back to you in the form of personalized ads.\n\nSo, even though you may not have talked about or searched that trip to Spain, your phone may have intuited what you were thinking and come to the conclusion on its own based on the data it collected. Maybe your friends were searching for Spanish AirBnBs while next to you, or maybe you downloaded Duolingo and started learning Spanish recently, or maybe your shopping trends show a recent uptick in the amount of saffron and jamón you’ve been buying.\n\nAny and all of this metadata could be the reasoning for the eerily relevant ads you’re seeing. And while your phone could truly be listening in, it might just be the unspoken data you’re sharing in other ways that gives you away."}

In fact, some say it’s top of the list, even more than RAM sticks and graphics cards, which are some of the other biggest offenders.\n\nSo why are motherboards so technically irksome? It’s because as far as hardware goes there’s a lot riding on them. They have to accommodate all the varying components of the PC — the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and peripherals, as well as distribute the PC’s power and data. Motherboards also house the all-important BIOS.\n\nSuffice it to say, if they are poorly designed or aren’t built well — like many cheap motherboards are — they can stop working suddenly or else damage your components.\n\nLooking at some of the concerns about the quality of cheap motherboards mentioned online and it’s alarming the problems gamers have encountered. They’ve pointed out flaws such as attachment points designed so poorly that they bend the SSD, or designs that don’t accommodate double-sided SSDs, requiring them to be taped down on the back side.\n\nThen there are motherboards with unusually placed front panel I/Os, such that the cables barely reach the header for connection, and those with such little headroom between the USB header and case that it’s impossible to use them.\n\nAnother common concern is just shoddy manufacturing. One PC builder pointed out coils that jutted out at different angles rather than coming straight off the board as they should.\n\nIf you plan on overclocking your CPU, you’re also ill advised to buy a cheap motherboard from a fringe manufacturer. That’s because they often have inadequate Voltage Regulator Modules (VRMs). High-quality VRMs are essential for achieving high, stable CPU overclocks, so if you opt for a cheap motherboard you may be unknowingly affecting the performance you can get.\n\nEven if a cheap motherboard doesn’t have these problems, it may simply lack the kind of manufacturer documentation you need. It might have no physical instructions or else no explainer video in English. Some motherboards also have manufacturer websites that are so slow it can take several days to update the BIOS, which makes building a rig yourself a lot more difficult than it should be.\n\nAll that said my advice to gamers looking for a motherboard is to never scale down on quality by buying a cheap board to save money, but to buy a well-made motherboard from a reputable manufacturer and scale down on functionality instead (if you must save money).\n\nYou will save money in the long run buying a well-made gaming motherboard from a reputable manufacturer. Asus\n\nWhat I mean by that is you should aim to purchase a motherboard that has all the things you need for functionality and performance — one that supports the kind of RAM and SSD you need, one that has the right CPU socket and all the connectors — as well as slots for upgrading — but nothing that you don’t need or won’t need in the future.\n\nAs an example, you might opt for the $178 MSI B650 Tomahawk WiFi over the $230 Gigabyte X870 Eagle WI-FI motherboard if you don’t need the Gigabyte’s quicker and more reliable Wi-Fi 7. In doing so you’ll save yourself $52.\n\nBut notice how both of these motherboards are from reputable manufacturers regardless of their functionality?\n\nIn summary, while it’s tempting to use the price filters on PC component websites to search and find a motherboard from a fringe manufacturer that’s a lot cheaper than what you’d get from reputable brand, you really shouldn’t. Always buy quality and you can’t go wrong.\n\nFurther reading: I’m a gaming mouse expert: Here’s why I carefully select my mouse mat"}

Now They Know How It Feels", "fullContent": "Image Credit WPLG/YouTube\n\nA couple of news articles this week intended to instill the usual fear and panic that the dying media love to spread, but for anyone who isn’t a wild and vicious Democrat, they should have made for thoroughly enjoyable reads.\n\nThe New York Times on Thursday ran the headline “Trump Escalates Use of Official Power to Intimidate and Punish His Perceived Foes.” The article details individuals and law firms the administration has singled out for either legal probing or exclusion from conducting private business with federal agencies. “President Trump’s first-term efforts to spur law enforcement officials to pursue his political enemies were haphazard, informal and often hashed out in private,” it said. “Now, his demands for investigations are starting to become more formalized through written presidential decrees as he seeks to use the power of public office to punish people and companies he has cast as enemies and silence potential critics.”\n\nIn short, Trump recently directed his Homeland Security department to review the professional conduct of an official from his first term (the official had publicly declared he was opposing the administration from within) and ordered the Justice Department to investigate a member of the government’s technical support to determine whether he had illegally shared classified information with unauthorized individuals. Trump also signed an order barring the law firm Susman Godfrey from doing business with his administration, determining the firm to be at odds with his political priorities.\n\nThe second article came Monday in The Guardian. “US student journalists go dark fearing Trump crusade against pro-Palestinian speech,” read the headline on top of a story about the “legal repercussions, online harassment and professional consequences” some college-level students are “fearing” because of their public protests and arguments related to the war in Israel. “[S]tudent journalists are retracting their names from published articles amid intensifying repression by the Trump administration targeting students perceived to be associated with the pro-Palestinian movement,” it read.\n\nIt’s funny. I don’t recall articles in either publication about the intimidation and fear experienced by anyone who found himself on the receiving end of the Biden administration’s Justice Department. Merrick Garland, President Biden’s pick to lead the agency, went on a four-year manic rampage harassing concerned parents at local school board meetings, protesters praying in front of abortion clinics and anyone who so much as thought about attending the Jan. 6 “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington (including a former president).\n\nAnd that’s to say nothing of the dread and anxiety felt by unassuming, relatively apolitical conservative or Republican-voting students on university campuses for decades. They’ve long had to self-censor and avoid political controversy out of legitimate fear that expressing themselves would affect their grades and future employment prospects and lead to social ostracism.\n\nMy book Liberal Misery: How the Hateful Left Sucks Joy Out of Everything and Everyone covers all of it.\n\nIf the tables have turned even a single degree so that belligerent Democrats feel a fraction of the discomfort felt by everyone else until now, it’s a glorious day in America."}

If you can afford it, this dock is very much worth the price. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nSonnet’s Echo 13 Thunderbolt 5 SSD Dock carves out a new tier in both price and performance, blowing away conventional Thunderbolt 4 docks as a new tier of ultrapremium Thunderbolt 5 docking stations takes hold.\n\nI fully expect more Thunderbolt 5 docking stations to be released. Hopefully, their performance meets or even exceeds that of the Sonnet Echo 13, which should place among the best Thunderbolt docks that we recommend that you buy.\n\nSonnet’s dock is the second Thunderbolt 5 docking station I’ve tested, and the first with an integrated SSD. The integrated SSD drives up the cost substantially, but its performance sits well above a conventional external SSD. (Intel’s original reference design included an integrated SSD, my contacts say, so some manufacturers followed suit.) It’s a smart decision, nevertheless, and one that is a killer selling point for this laptop docking station.\n\nSonnet’s dock measures about 8.5 inches long and about 3.75 inches deep, and is slightly thicker than an inch. There is no option to mount it vertically. The dock is made of plastic, with what appears to be venting on the top and sides.\n\nThis is one of the best Thunderbolt docks I’ve ever tested, even with the Thunderbolt 5 infrastructure still in its infancy.\n\nOn the front of the dock is a power button, with LEDs signaling power and an active Thunderbolt connection. The power button needs to be held down for a second or two to turn the dock on and off.\n\nSonnet clearly labeled both front ports: a 140W Thunderbolt 5 port that connects via a 31-inch Thunderbolt 5 cable, as well as a second, 60W Thunderbolt 5 port. On the front is a 10Gbps USB-A port, a UHS-II SD and microSD card slot, and a headphone jack. On the rear of the dock are two more Thunderbolt 5 ports, two more 10Gbps USB-A ports (and a 5Gbps USB-A port, too), and an RJ45 connector for up to 2.5Gbit Ethernet.\n\nSonnet’s Echo 13 Thunderbolt 5 SSD Dock can pass data at up to 120Gbps. Mark Hachman / Foundry\n\nUnfortunately, given the price of the dock, there are no dedicated HDMI or DisplayPort ports, which may require you to purchase additional cables. On the other hand, my 4K, 160Hz test displays support high-speed USB-C inputs, and if you’re in the market for such a dock, yours might as well. Remember, Thunderbolt 4’s base spec supports two 4K displays at 60Hz; Thunderbolt 5 supports three 4K, 144Hz displays. In this case, I simply reused existing 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4 cables.\n\nTwo of my test displays reliably connected at 4K, 144Hz resolution, but not three. (The dock sent content to all three 4K displays, at 144Hz — but just two at a time.)\n\nGiven the issues I had with this same laptop and a Kensington dock, I suspected that my test laptop might be the issue. At press time, there were virtually no Thunderbolt 5 laptops to test with; after consultation with Sonnet’s engineers and other sources, I’ve concluded that the laptop’s Thunderbolt 5 controller may be split between the two ports. That won’t allow the laptop to display on three external 4K144 displays, even if the dock allows it. I’ll be updating my test laptop as soon as I can.\n\nThe front of the Sonnet Echo 13 Thunderbolt 5 SSD Dock, with power and LEDs, plus the Thunderbolt 5 connection to your PC, USB-A, and SD/microSD card slots. Mark Hachman / Foundry\n\nNote that while this dock is backwards-compatible with a Thunderbolt 4 laptop, you’ll receive the best value using Thunderbolt 5 hardware. Sonnet notes that the slower Thunderbolt 4 I/O connection will throttle the SSD, which is a key selling point for this dock.\n\nIntegrating an SSD offers benefits as well as concerns\n\nAs someone who typically leaves a USB key plugged into the dock to serve as a “sneakernet” of sorts, the idea of having dedicated storage in a dock appeals to me. Sonnet ships this dock with either a 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB SSD inside; my review unit had a 2TB SSD.\n\nYou’d never know it, though. My review unit came with the drive in an unformatted state, meaning that it didn’t show up in File Explorer and essentially didn’t “exist” as far as my PC was concerned. Sonnet’s original documentation said nothing about this, and even an updated version that the company sent electronically barely mentioned it or what to do.\n\nUpdate April 21, 2025: After this review published, Sonnet now says that it will preformat the SSD (as ex-FAT) before shipping and add instructions on how to reformat and repartition the SSD, if needed. Put another way, Sonnet believes that you’ll never experience the pre-formatting issues I experienced.\n\nIt’s not hard to search for how to solve this problem; using Windows’ own search tool and looking for “create and format hard disk partitions” brings up the Disk Management window under the Windows Control Panel. That tool shows the unformatted drive, which you can right-click on to format and make the drive usable. A Thunderbolt dock, however, is essentially plug-and-play, and formatting an external SSD most decidedly is not. I’d recommend that Sonnet either pre-format the drive or include a dedicated, detailed tutorial on how to do so.\n\nThere are a pair of lock slots on the end of the Sonnet Echo 13 Thunderbolt 5 SSD Dock. Mark Hachman / Foundry\n\nThe drive is not encrypted by default, though it is surrounded by the dock itself and is not designed to be user-accessible. Windows does provide drive encryption, known as BitLocker, though that’s a feature that’s exclusive to Windows 10/11 Pro. (A Windows 10/11 Home machine can access a BitLocker-encrypted external SSD via a dedicated password that must be typed in.) If you don’t encrypt the embedded SSD, that means that there’s a drive that anyone can access just by docking their laptop. Could someone malicious plant spyware or malware on it? Possibly.\n\nA portable SSD can also be picked up and carried with you, or secured elsewhere. This isn’t an argument for or against Sonnet’s dock! But it is a list of things to think about if you’re considering buying it.\n\nSonnet does claim that the integrated SSD, connected via Thunderbolt 5, will be faster than an SSD connected to your PC via USB. And boy, is it ever.\n\nSonnet Echo 13 Thunderbolt 5 SSD Dock: Performance\n\nMy earlier experience with the Kensington SD5000T5 EQ Thunderbolt 5 Triple 4K Docking Station, the first TB5 dock I’d tested, was a huge bust. At the time, I didn’t feel confident in trying to assign blame, since I was working with a new laptop, new cables, and a new dock. For this testing, I used the same Maingear laptop (with a 14th-gen Core HX chip and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU) that I did for that previous test.\n\nMy experience with the Sonnet dock was far better, and what I’d expect from the Thunderbolt 5 experience.\n\nThe rear of the Sonnet Echo 13 Thunderbolt 5 SSD Dock includes three USB-A ports, 2.5Gb Ethernet, and the two upstream Thunderbolt 5 ports. Mark Hachman / Foundry\n\nStability-wise, the Echo 13 demonstrated a decent amount of what I call “display bounce.” Plugging a laptop into the dock — which was already connected to a pair of 4K, 144Hz displays — produced a situation where the displays flipped off and on and realigned themselves for a few seconds. That’s not particularly unusual.\n\nAfter that, everything settled down, all the displays remained connected, and the performance was smooth and pretty stable, as you’d expect. But there were several times that the dock struggled to light one display after resuming from sleep, and rarely (once every couple of days) one display disconnected for a second, resumed, and continued normally. (Powering the dock on and off solved this.) I suspect that this was the laptop’s fault. The SSD remained accessible at all times.\n\nThe dock is rated to supply 140W of output power to a laptop. While my test laptop, Maingear’s ML-17, supports Thunderbolt 5, it can’t accept the 140W of power the dock theoretically provides. (Dell’s latest workstation-class laptops do, though I do not have one to test.) So while I can’t confirm how much maximum power the dock can provide over the Thunderbolt cable, it did provide 78W over the main TB5 connection, and 56W (out of a rated 60W) via the other front Thunderbolt connection. That’s just fine to fast-charge a smartphone.\n\n(Note that the 85W passed via the Thunderbolt 5 cable will not be sufficient to charge gaming laptops, such as the first few with Thunderbolt 5 connections. You’ll still need to charge those devices via their dedicated chargers.)\n\nDuring my streaming tests, where I stream a 4K, 60Hz video over the internet via the Ethernet cable, everything went perfectly — the dock dropped 6 out of 10,000 frames, which is negligible. I did notice a little judder from simultaneously playing a second video on a second display, which I normally didn’t do. But YouTube didn’t note any dropped frames, so that might have been an issue with the GPU.\n\nBut the storage performance is revelatory. Sonnet describes the internal SSD’s speed as “ridiculous” and this is one of the few times I’d agree with the marketing copy. Ludicrous speed, even!\n\nI check SSD speeds by connecting a standard SSD to the dock’s USB-C port and running PCMark 10’s external benchmark, which reports the transfer data in megabytes per second as well as an abstract score. To date, the very best scores I’ve ever seen are about 135MB/s, with a score of 850 or so. Directly connected to the laptop, my test SSD delivers 160MB/s and a score of 1,042.\n\nSonnet’s Echo 13 Thunderbolt 5 SSD Dock delivered data to the laptop at 279.8MB/s for a score of 1,891. That’s a 75 percent increase in pure throughput! Put another way, when testing the drive using CrystalDiskMark 8.0, sequential read performance was 3,977MB/s, almost double the read performance of 2,036MB/s from the Lexar SL600, an external 20Gbps SSD.\n\nI also simply copy a folder of raw multimedia files from the SSD to the desktop. All of these tests are pushing this data through the dock’s internal circuitry over the Thunderbolt 5 cable. About the best score I’ve seen is 1 minute, 2 seconds, tacking on an additional 4 more seconds if I’m streaming video during the copy process. Sonnet’s Echo 13 copied the files in 13.9 seconds, or 14.2 seconds while streaming. That’s a 78 percent decrease in the time taken by that test alone!\n\nIt’s worth noting that I still connected my traditional test SSD to the dock’s USB-C port, and here Sonnet’s dock wasn’t nearly as impressive: 106.2 MB/s, or a score of 682. That’s lower than the competition, if you decided not to use the internal SSD.\n\nThroughout all of that, the dock was as cool as the other side of the pillow — quite literally. It didn’t even warm to the touch, probably because it sounds like it has a quiet, active fan cooling the dock.\n\nShould you buy the Sonnet Echo 13 Thunderbolt 5 SSD Dock?\n\nThe integrated SSD is a significant cost adder, and not necessarily worth it if your storage needs are already served.\n\nOn the other hand, the performance of the dock’s SSD certainly makes up for it. A premium Thunderbolt dock plus the price of a 2TB SSD works out to about $450, which isn’t too much less than what Sonnet is charging.\n\nIn general, this dock did everything I’ve asked it to do. I’m still struggling with a test bed that can adequately measure the power a Thunderbolt 5 dock provides, and I’m pretty sure that the dock’s inability to output to three 4K/144 displays (as opposed to just two) may be the fault of the laptop, not the dock. We already know that not much Thunderbolt 5 hardware is available.\n\nOtherwise, I’m extremely pleased with the Sonnet Echo 13 Thunderbolt 5 SSD Dock and would recommend it even in the current state of the market and at its current price. Sonnet’s Echo 13 offers both amazing performance and reliable stability, and sets the bar for other ultrapremium Thunderbolt 5 docks to trail in its wake. Others will follow, certainly. But right now, Sonnet’s dock is the best I’ve ever tested."}

It doesn’t specify whether the assistant would be included in the initial iOS 19.0 release in September or a point update like iOS 19.1 later in the fall.\n\n“Apple hasn’t canceled its revamped Siri. The company plans to release a virtual assistant in the fall capable of doing things like editing and sending a photo to a friend on request, three people with knowledge of its plans said,” reads the piece.\n\nNYT: AI-powered Siri coming this fall\n\nTripp Mickle at The New York Times:\n\nThe company’s issues underscored how its reputation for innovation, once considered a fundamental element of its brand, has become an albatross, fueling angst among employees and frustration among customers.\n\nThe albatross comparisons sounds apt.\n\nAnd company insiders worry that Apple, despite its years of gravity-defying profits, is hamstrung by the political infighting, penny pinching and talent drain that often bedevil large companies, according to more than a dozen former and current employees and advisers.\n\nPenny pinching came into light in early 2023, when Apple’s AI chief John Giannandrea wanted to buy more Nvidia chips for AI training. At the time, Apple’s data centers had about 50,000 GPUs that were more than five years old. In comparison, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta had purchased hundreds of thousands of GPUs. Cook approved doubling the AI team’s chip budget, but finance chief Luca Maestri got in the way, reducing the increase to less than half that. HE reportedly “encouraged the team” to make the chips they had “more efficient.” If that’s not penny pinching, I don’t know what is.\n\nThe lack of GPUs meant the team developing AI systems had to negotiate for data center computing power from its providers like Google and Amazon, two of the people said. The leading chips made by Nvidia were in such demand that Apple used alternative chips made by Google for some of its AI development.\n\nOn political infighting:\n\nAt the same time, leaders at two of Apple’s software teams were battling over who would spearhead the rollout of Siri’s new abilities, three people who worked on the effort said. Robby Walker, who oversaw Siri, and Sebastien Marineau-Mes, a senior executive with the software team, struggled over who would have responsibility for some aspects of the project. Both ended up with pieces of the project.\n\nOn talent drain:\n\nIn 2019, Jony Ive, the company’s chief designer, left to start his own design firm and poached more than a dozen integral Apple designers and engineers. And Dan Riccio, the company’s longtime head of product design who sworked on the Apple Watch, retired last year.\n\nSo far, the Siri makeover has included a glow animation around the edges when invoking the assistant, the ability to tap into Apple’s support articles to provide product knowledge and an integration with ChatGPT. The delayed features include awareness of the user’s personal content (“When’s Mom’s flight arriving?”) and taking complex actions across apps on your behalf.\n\nApple’s Siri problems are a sign of poor leadership\n\nBloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple’s leadership revealed in an all-hands meeting following the announcement of the Siri delay that internal testing had found that an AI-infused Siri was inaccurate on nearly a third of requests.\n\nApple has suffered a significant blow to its reputation over the Siri delay, resulting in a reshuffling among its executive ranks. The Siri team is now under the leadership of Apple’s software chief Craig Federighi, with Mike Rockwell, the head of its Vision Pro headset, charged with leading the project instead of John Giannandrea.\n\nThe Information recently reported that much of Apple’s problems with Siri stem from poor leadership. Unnamed employees told the publication that Robby Walker, the former executive in charge of AI upgrades to Siri, lacks “both ambition and an appetite for taking risks” on designing future versions of the voice assistant.\n\nAmong engineers inside Apple, the AI group’s relaxed culture and struggles with execution have even earned it an uncharitable nickname, a play on its initials: AIMLess.\n\nOuch! The article also claims that the Siri demo where the assistant is asked about an executive mom’s flight landing and lunch plans was choreographed, and that the only feature ready for testing was the new Siri glow animation:\n\nAmong members of the Siri team at Apple, though, the demonstration was a surprise. They had never seen working versions of the capabilities, according to a former Apple employee. At the time, the only new feature from the demonstration that was activated for test devices was a pulsing, colorful ribbon that appeared on the edges of the iPhone’s screen when a user invoked Siri, the former employee said.\n\nSoftware chief Craig Federighi has reportedly built his own AI division, dubbed Intelligent Systems, as part of the reshuffling. Meanwhile, John Giannandrea is now apparently solely focused on Apple’s research in the AI and ML fields. Most importantly, Federighi is said to have changed Apple’s policy to permit the use of third-party AI models to build new Siri features."}

Having gone through the required concussion protocols, the goalkeeper is now deemed fit and ready for selection.\n\n“Yes, he is,” Slot confirmed during Friday’s press conference, when asked if the Brazilian shot-stopper was fully recovered.\n\nThe absence of Alisson was keenly felt. While Caoimhín Kelleher has proven a competent deputy, Liverpool’s back line operates with a different rhythm and assurance when Alisson is marshalling from the rear. His return comes as Liverpool continue their hunt for Champions League qualification, where defensive solidity will be crucial in the season’s final stretch.\n\nAlisson’s leadership, command of his box and sweeping ability are not simply added bonuses—they are essential traits in how Liverpool build from the back and navigate high-pressing opponents like West Ham.\n\nConor Bradley Set for Starting Role After Return from Injury\n\nOn the other side of the pitch, Liverpool are also likely to welcome back Conor Bradley into the starting XI. The young full-back made his first appearance in nearly two months as a substitute during the 3-2 defeat to Fulham last week. With a full week of training under his belt, Slot suggested Bradley is ready to reclaim his spot.\n\n“Yes, it does,” Slot said, when asked whether Bradley was in contention to start. “Of course it’s a boost, it’s always a boost when quality players come back. Especially quality players in that position.”\n\nSlot’s remarks hinted not just at Bradley’s fitness but at the larger tactical picture. “I think Curtis Jones is a quality player but it’s not his favourite position,” he explained. “So to have a player in his favourite position is always – not always – but might be better for the team.”\n\nBradley has impressed throughout the campaign, showcasing not only defensive reliability but also a maturity in decision-making and positional awareness far beyond his age. His ability to slot seamlessly into Liverpool’s high-tempo transitional system makes him a key asset, particularly when Trent Alexander-Arnold is unavailable.\n\n“When Trent then isn’t there, you always hope to look behind you and see that Conor is available,” Slot added. “But then if he isn’t, we have to solve that problem.”\n\nSlot Emphasises Squad Depth Amid Fixture Demands\n\nInjuries have tested Liverpool’s depth all season, and Slot has made it clear that adaptability within the squad has been vital. “We are not the only team in this league that has had these problems. We’ve tried to bring the best out of it,” he said, referencing the performances of makeshift full-backs like Jones.\n\n“That worked really well against Everton. I think Curtis played well also against Fulham. Of course he was involved in the goal but you can ask yourself the question if he could do so much about that.”\n\nSlot’s pragmatism is evident, yet his words also underline the reality: when the specialists return, they play. “Now to have Conor back, I think we all would make the same decision and that’s playing Conor in that position.”\n\nPositive Momentum Ahead of Season Run-In\n\nWith Alisson Becker back between the sticks and Conor Bradley set to re-establish himself at right-back, Liverpool are poised to reassert themselves. While Slot has handled adversity with composure and tactical flexibility, the return of key personnel brings the kind of clarity any manager craves in the business end of the season.\n\nLiverpool’s trip to West Ham offers a chance to right the wrongs of the Fulham loss and keep pressure on the top four. With Alisson’s calming presence and Bradley’s energy down the flank, the Reds may just have the tools they need to secure a crucial three points."}

The news dropped like a stone into still water—calm on the surface, but the ripples run deep.\n\nThere was a time when decisions at Anfield carried the kind of quiet brilliance that made you trust them instinctively. Back then, under Michael Edwards, eyebrows remained unraised, confidence unshaken. But that era is over, and in its place has come something more uncertain, less assured. Post-Edwards, with no Sporting Director steering the ship for much of the time, Liverpool’s transfer logic has sometimes felt more muddled than meticulous.\n\nSo now we have this: Mohamed Salah, still draped in red, still our talisman—but for how much longer at his peak?\n\nMohamed Salah has signed a new £20 million-a-year contract at Liverpool, bringing the formal end to epic negotiations ✍️ @_ChrisBascombehttps://t.co/5LmAvJ3frc#TelegraphFootball — Telegraph Football (@TeleFootball) April 11, 2025\n\nSigns of Decline Amid the Brilliance\n\nSalah’s numbers still impress on the surface—goals, assists, moments of individual class—but the deeper data, the kind Liverpool’s analysts pore over, tells a more sobering story. His top speed is waning. His high-intensity sprints are falling off. His total distance covered is dipping, and since the turn of the year, even his ability to carry the ball at defenders has diminished.\n\nInside the club, they’ll know this. They’ll have modelled it, run simulations, debated the trajectory. So the decision to hand him a reported £400,000-a-week contract, according to Chris Bascombe, is not one taken lightly—it’s a calculated risk.\n\nBut let’s be honest: risks have become all too common lately. The signing of Darwin Núñez was questionable. Luis Díaz? Exciting, yes, but maybe not what was needed. Cody Gakpo’s arrival forced a reshuffle that made more noise than sense. And crucially, Liverpool still haven’t sorted out a stable long-term Director of Football—leaving contract management in a mess and decision-making vulnerable to short-term thinking.\n\nLosing the Edge Without Trent\n\nOne factor that’s amplified Salah’s recent drop-off is the absence of Trent Alexander-Arnold. The partnership between them has been symphonic at times—two players who seem to share a sixth sense, picking out each other’s movements with a precision rare in football. When Trent’s not on the pitch, Salah’s reduced. The rhythm is off. The ball takes longer to find him. He becomes peripheral, isolated—just another winger, rather than the man who makes defences panic.\n\nConsider this: in his last two league starts, Salah has taken just two shots, generated an xG of 0.5, and managed four shot-creating actions. That’s not form—that’s famine. And it’s not just on him. Opponents have worked out that if you double up on Salah, there’s little fear of being punished elsewhere. The rest of the front line, to put it bluntly, hasn’t frightened anyone.\n\nWhat Comes Next Under Arne Slot?\n\nLiverpool had a choice. Let Salah go and rebuild the attack—perhaps into a more fluid, interchangeable system, similar to what PSG attempt with their rotating front three. Or double down on their No.11, structure everything around him, and hope to squeeze every last ounce from a generational talent in his twilight years.\n\nThey chose the latter. It’s bold. It could be brilliant. It could also backfire if recruitment this summer isn’t spot-on. If reinforcements don’t arrive to support and unlock Salah, then Liverpool risk becoming over-reliant on a 33-year-old who, by winter, often looks like he’s already played a season’s worth of football.\n\nAnd this isn’t said with malice. Salah remains a phenomenon. But second-half-of-the-season Salah has never quite matched the devastating impact of his autumn version. Relying on him as your sole spearhead feels like leaning too heavily on nostalgia.\n\nThere’s still a chance this works. If Arne Slot and his staff transition Salah into more of a supplier—an experienced outlet feeding a new generation of pace and purpose—it could extend his relevance and ease the burden. But if the creative load remains solely on his shoulders, there’s only one likely outcome.\n\nSo yes, he stays. But Liverpool haven’t just handed out a new contract—they’ve committed to a path that could shape the club’s next few years. Whether it’s brilliance or blind loyalty, only time will tell."}

On the latest episode of Another Podcast, Dave Hendrick delivered a marathon breakdown of 25 defensive midfielders who could reshape Liverpool’s core. With no creative licence taken, we examine the players through Hendrick’s direct lens, focusing on his detailed insights and relentless drive to solve Liverpool’s midfield dilemma.\n\nAnother Podcast: Loads of Defensive Mids ️ @HendrickD82 looks at potential DMs for the summer! Listen Now: https://t.co/a8CMrMoyVC pic.twitter.com/5q5On42CNG — AnfieldIndex (@AnfieldIndex) April 10, 2025\n\nAdam Wharton Tops the List\n\nFor Hendrick, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton is the standout candidate: “He is the prototypical player that Arne is looking for in this role.” The former Blackburn talent has shown exceptional composure and tactical maturity for a 21-year-old. “He was born to play that deepest role as a controller… the best passer England have produced probably since Michael Carrick,” said Hendrick, who added that Wharton “takes the ball in with a great level of security… has a full picture of the pitch in his head.”\n\nWharton’s display against Brighton stood out in Hendrick’s analysis: “He went up against [Carlos] Baleba and Diego Gomez… matched their physical level while outplaying them from a technical point of view.” Hendrick believes a midfield of Wharton and Alexis Mac Allister would offer “IQ, ball retention, progression, control.”\n\nLamine Camara: All-Round Midfield Dynamite\n\nAnother name Hendrick flagged was Lamine Camara, describing him as “a do-everything midfielder.” Currently at AS Monaco, the Senegal international was praised as someone who could be anything from a six to a ten. “You want him to be a six, he’ll be a six… he is a more dynamic, stronger, more defensive-minded version of Naby Keïta,” he said.\n\nIn one of Hendrick’s most emphatic endorsements, he declared: “The player he reminds me of is Lothar Matthäus… he just does everything well.” For Hendrick, Camara’s ability to play in any midfield configuration makes him invaluable. “He’s smart enough to make everything work… great set piece taker too.”\n\nPhysicality and Mindset: Alan Varela and Others\n\nHendrick was unflinching about Liverpool’s current midfield softness, pointing to the infamous tackle on Mac Allister by James Tarkowski. “Nobody went hunting afterwards… that worries me.” For him, Boca Juniors graduate Alan Varela, now at FC Porto, represents the toughness Liverpool lack. “Varela has never been bullied in his life. That fella went to the Emirates, grabbed Declan Rice around the neck and said ‘What the [expletive] are you going to do about it?’ And Declan Rice shrank.”\n\nVarela’s versatility impressed Hendrick, who sees him working in double pivots with Gravenberch, Jones, or Mac Allister. “He brings the right mindset and mentality to our team.”\n\nRealism Over Fantasy: ‘Tire-Kicking Exercises’ and Top Five\n\nHendrick was pragmatic throughout, acknowledging that some names like Eduardo Camavinga and Warren Zaïre-Emery fall into “tire-kicking exercises.” While admiring their quality, he noted the unlikelihood of a deal.\n\nStill, he gave a clear top five, factoring in “style, price, injury track record, availability”:\n\nAdam Wharton Lamine Camara Carlos Baleba Archie Gray Ardon Jashari\n\nWharton and Camara emerged as “the two that stand out a mile.” Hendrick concluded: “They tick so many boxes for me… if I had to just pick two, they would be the two.”"}

According to David Ornstein of The Athletic, the Reds are firmly in the race for Bournemouth’s Dean Huijsen—a 19-year-old centre-back whose stock has soared after a standout season on the South Coast.\n\nHuijsen, signed by Bournemouth from Juventus for £15 million last summer, has been one of the Premier League’s breakout stars. Comfortable on the ball, aggressive in duels, and tactically intelligent beyond his years, the Spain youth international has made 29 appearances this campaign and helped the Cherries mount an unexpected push for European qualification.\n\nThe price tag? £50 million—a clause that could be triggered quickly in a summer market expected to move at pace.\n\nReal Madrid Out, Premier League Giants Circle\n\nWhile Real Madrid’s historic pull once loomed large over Huijsen’s future, Ornstein reports that “it looks most probable he will join another Premier League club.” That shifts the focus firmly back to England, where Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Newcastle, and Tottenham are all actively engaged.\n\nOrnstein notes: “I now understand that Liverpool are among the clubs with a firm interest in Dean Huijsen… I believe they have all held meetings or conversations with Huijsen’s camp in the last week but I’m not aware of offers being made just yet.”\n\nThis signals a crucial moment for Liverpool’s recruitment team, who may see Huijsen as more than just a squad addition. He could be a long-term starter—and maybe sooner than expected.\n\nKonaté’s Future Adds Weight to Huijsen Pursuit\n\nOne of the more eye-catching elements of Ornstein’s piece is the suggestion that Huijsen’s arrival might spell trouble for Ibrahima Konaté.\n\n“Maybe their consideration is influenced by the lack of developments so far on Ibrahima Konate’s contract situation and you imagine Huijsen would have a good chance of starting alongside Virgil van Dijk if he was signed.”\n\nThis would be no small shift. Konaté has shown flashes of world-class defending since his arrival, but injuries and inconsistency have limited his reliability. At 25, he’s at a point where contract clarity should be forthcoming. The fact that it’s not may have accelerated Liverpool’s push for alternatives.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nDean Huijsen would be an exciting signing—and perhaps an essential one. With Virgil van Dijk entering the twilight of his peak years and Ibrahima Konaté’s long-term future still uncertain, Liverpool need to be proactive rather than reactive.\n\nAt 19, Huijsen brings top-level potential already seasoned with Premier League experience. He’s not a project in need of years of development; he’s a player ready to contribute immediately, with ceiling to grow. At £50 million, that sounds like smart business in this climate, especially if the club sees him as a potential leader in the next generation of defenders.\n\nThe fact that top clubs like Arsenal and Chelsea are circling adds weight to his quality, but Liverpool’s track record of executing early and decisive moves gives them a real chance.\n\nThe idea of a Van Dijk-Huijsen axis is appealing, as is a long term partnership of Konate and Huijsen. If Liverpool pull this off, it’ll be one of the summer’s smartest moves."}

While Jurgen Klopp’s legacy remains etched in Anfield’s fabric, Slot must now define his own tactical and personnel philosophy. Defence is a clear focal point—and according to insights from Dave Davis on the Anfield Index podcast with Trev Downey, two names are surfacing repeatedly: Dean Huijsen and Marc Guehi.\n\nYouthful Promise Versus Premier League Experience\n\nDavis was unequivocal in confirming Liverpool’s interest in Dean Huijsen, a highly-rated 18-year-old Dutch centre-back currently at AFC Bournemouth. He stated, “David Ornstein has confirmed Liverpool’s interest in Huijsen.” What’s interesting here is the calibre of competition—“Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur have all met with his representatives.” That level of attention is telling.\n\nThis isn’t merely a scouting mission—it’s a full court press. Yet as Davis shrewdly points out, “Pretty much, he is going to pick wherever he wants to go next and his Dad has even said that he would love for Real Madrid to join the race.” That sort of player agency puts added pressure on Liverpool’s recruitment pitch. Financially, Liverpool cannot outbid the others, and Davis admitted as much: “We’re never going to win the financial battle, but you’ve got to promise him that we are the best route for him to become one of the best defenders in the world.”\n\nThere’s a maturity in that observation. Liverpool under Slot must sell a vision. A route to stardom. The difficulty, however, is that Huijsen may not start immediately. “I think the issue is that he would be third choice at first and is he willing to be that patient?” That’s the crux of it. Slot may well rotate tactically, but Liverpool already have Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konaté, and Jarell Quansah. It’s not a simple entry.\n\nAnd yet, Davis forecasts movement: “He will definitely go in the summer and it wouldn’t surprise me if all of those clubs trigger his £50m release clause and then he gets to just pick.” This is a market shaped by opportunity, not desperation. And Slot must pick wisely.\n\nGuehi: Under the Radar, Over the Bar?\n\nMarc Guehi, meanwhile, represents the opposite side of the spectrum. Premier League experience, international recognition, and quiet consistency. Davis added, “Ornstein did mention Marc Guehi too and mentioned Liverpool’s name alongside him.” But it’s Guehi’s temperament that stands out: “We’ve been talking about this one for months and he is not creating any noise about a move at all because he is so respectful.”\n\nThis is important. In an age where agents dominate headlines and players nudge narratives, Guehi’s silence speaks volumes. “He wants to go to that next level, but he’s not going to make it so obvious.” That’s a mentality that should appeal to Slot, particularly in a dressing room undergoing inevitable change.\n\nDowney raises a pertinent concern, though: “He turns 25 this summer but the immediate argument is that he is too small to be centre-back for Liverpool.” Size has always been a hot topic, but it’s worth noting that Guehi’s positional awareness and athleticism often compensate. Still, with Slot yet to outline his tactical preferences in detail, “we just don’t know what Slot’s plans are and again what would his role in this squad be?”\n\nFitting the Slot System\n\nThat final point is perhaps the most important. Liverpool fans are still adjusting to a post-Klopp identity. Slot brings a different style—possession-based, proactive, positional. The kind of centre-back he wants may not match the archetype we’re used to. Huijsen might fit the long-term ball-playing mould. Guehi might be a plug-and-play short-term answer. Each player answers a different question.\n\nWhat Liverpool must decide is which question is more urgent."}

Giorgi Mamardashvili, the highly-rated Georgian goalkeeper signed by the Reds last summer and loaned immediately back to Valencia, was widely expected to report for pre-season at Kirkby this July. Yet reports from Cadena SER, relayed via Estadio Deportivo, suggest that his arrival may not be as certain as once believed.\n\nMamardashvili has not hidden his intentions. Speaking in March, he made it clear:\n\n“I am going to Liverpool to fight for the number one spot. I will go there to train at my best, and I don’t know what they will decide afterward.”\n\n“I don’t decide who plays and who doesn’t.”\n\nWhile it’s common for players to show ambition, these words hint at something deeper: a reluctance to accept a backup role, even temporarily. Liverpool may see him as Alisson Becker’s heir, but the Georgian clearly sees himself as a present, not future, proposition.\n\nValencia’s Counter-Move\n\nAccording to Cadena SER, Valencia are not ready to let their star goalkeeper walk out the door just yet. They want to build their team around him, pushing for an extension of the loan that benefits both club and player. In truth, Valencia may need Mamardashvili more than Liverpool do at present, especially if Alisson continues at his typically elite level.\n\nThe same report adds that the player himself is open to the idea—under the right financial terms. Currently, Mamardashvili is losing money on the loan, a situation he would need rectified if he is to stay at the Mestalla.\n\n“Valencia would like to build the team around him.”\n\nIt’s a statement that flatters Mamardashvili, but also sharpens the tension. For a player determined to be first choice, the offer of being the central figure in La Liga rather than the second-in-command in the Premier League is understandably attractive.\n\nContradictory Reports Cause Confusion\n\nAdding to the intrigue is the contradictory messaging from Spanish media. While Cadena SER suggest an extended stay at Valencia is a real possibility, Super Deporte report that the goalkeeper’s arrival on Merseyside this summer is essentially a done deal.\n\nThis divergence reflects the murky, often politicised nature of transfer discussions in Spain. Agents, clubs, and media all have narratives to push. But for Liverpool, who must make critical decisions about Caoimhin Kelleher’s future this summer, clarity is vital.\n\nStrategic Patience or Missed Opportunity?\n\nFrom Liverpool’s perspective, the situation presents a genuine dilemma. Keeping Mamardashvili on loan offers stability for all parties—Valencia retain their No.1, the player gets regular minutes, and Liverpool maintain control. But there’s a cost: delaying his adaptation to Arne Slot’s system and the Premier League itself.\n\nWith Kelleher reportedly seeking a move for more game time, Liverpool may find themselves scrambling for an experienced backup if Mamardashvili isn’t ready to step in. The timing, in a summer expected to be transitional, matters.\n\nMamardashvili’s stance is bold, admirable even, but it creates friction. For a 23-year-old still learning the game’s elite requirements, balance between ambition and patience is key. Whether Liverpool agree remains to be seen.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool supporters, this report raises as many eyebrows as it does questions. On one hand, Giorgi Mamardashvili’s confidence is refreshing. A young keeper willing to challenge Alisson? That’s the kind of mentality that gets you far at a club like Liverpool. But there’s a fine line between ambition and impatience, and some fans might worry he’s leaning towards the latter.\n\nFrom a fan’s angle, the idea of Mamardashvili delaying his Anfield arrival is frustrating. If Kelleher departs, which seems increasingly likely, having Mamardashvili in place as a ready-made replacement feels like good planning. Pushing that timeline back could leave the club scrambling for a short-term fix—something we’ve seen before with mixed results.\n\nThat said, Slot may appreciate a year’s delay if it ensures the keeper arrives more seasoned and fully ready."}

The Deal That Almost Was – And Might Still Be\n\nIn a world of transfer rumours where smoke rarely leads to fire, the latest revelation about Victor Osimhen and Liverpool feels different – not least because it comes with names, numbers, and nearly-signed contracts. As revealed by Dave Davis on the Anfield Index podcast, Osimhen “was 24 hours from being a Liverpool player” in January.\n\nAnd yet, here we are in April, with Osimhen currently on loan at Galatasaray, Darwin Núñez still in red, and a lingering feeling that something big nearly happened.\n\nSo, what went wrong? And more crucially, why might it still happen?\n\nLoyalty Payments, Not Wages, Scuppered the Deal\n\nOne of the standout moments from the podcast is Davis’ clarity on why the deal collapsed. “The only thing that stopped it was the fact that he couldn’t sort out the loyalty payments that Napoli owed him.” It’s a rare case where the obstacle wasn’t wage demands, agents, or club refusal — but internal financial wrangling within Napoli. That makes this a classic “nearly” scenario, but one that could be revived.\n\nContrary to widespread assumptions, Osimhen’s wage demands weren’t the issue either. Davis is clear: “There was a lot of talk over his wages being £500,000-per-week but it wasn’t that. It was well within our wage structure.” That’s a significant revelation when evaluating Liverpool’s transfer strategy under Arne Slot, who’s known to prefer pragmatism and balance over superstar indulgence.\n\nDarwin Núñez Was Ready to Leave\n\nPerhaps the most eye-opening detail, though, was about Darwin Núñez. According to Davis: “Darwin Nunez missed the PSV game in the Champions League because he was finalising a deal with Saudi because Osimhen was coming in.”\n\nThat statement alone deserves pause. Al-Nassr were reportedly ready to pay £70 million for Núñez, who wasn’t missing the game due to illness, but because “he was supposed to leave.” It paints a radically different picture of Liverpool’s January strategy: a bold, aggressive move to refresh the front line in a manner few could have anticipated.\n\nThis wasn’t just a rumoured flirtation with Osimhen – it was a near-deal, so close to completion that Liverpool’s squad planning had already started to pivot.\n\nWhy a Summer Move Still Makes Sense\n\nWith the summer window approaching, Davis’ words carry weight: “So, if he was 24 hours away from becoming a Liverpool player in January, then how can we rule it out this summer?”\n\nOsimhen’s situation has only grown more precarious. With a year left on his Napoli contract and both parties seemingly eager to part ways, the price could be significantly lower. Davis makes the point compellingly: “If Alexander Isak is going to cost £120million, then would you not rather look at someone like Osimhen for around £60million?”\n\nOsimhen is a known quantity. A proven, elite striker with the physicality and movement that Slot’s high-tempo style thrives on. While questions remain over Darwin’s consistency, Osimhen’s goal record speaks for itself. He may not be Arne Slot’s first signing at Liverpool, but he could be the one who defines his first full season.\n\nVerdict: Don’t Rule It Out\n\nAs Davis himself said: “All of this stuff comes out eventually. I wouldn’t be saying it if I hadn’t verified it multiple times.” That kind of journalistic conviction adds weight to what might otherwise be dismissed as off-season chatter.\n\nWith Liverpool potentially entering a new era under Arne Slot, a striker like Osimhen would send a powerful message: that this club, despite Klopp’s departure, is still aiming for the very top.\n\nAnd if we were only 24 hours away in January? The clock may start ticking again soon."}

This move ends months of speculation over his future and sends a powerful message about the club’s intent under new manager Arne Slot.\n\nAt 32 years old, Salah shows no signs of slowing down. He’s in the midst of another sensational season, racking up 32 goals and 22 assists in 45 games across all competitions. His 27 Premier League goals currently lead the division. This isn’t just form – it’s dominance.\n\nSalah’s Legacy at Anfield Grows Stronger\n\nSince arriving from AS Roma in 2017, Salah has built a legacy few can rival. With 243 goals in 394 appearances, he’s now third on Liverpool’s all-time scoring list. His honours include the Premier League, Champions League, Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup, FA Cup, and two League Cups.\n\nHe’s also made the individual accolades look routine: three Premier League Golden Boots, two PFA Players’ Player of the Year awards, and two FWA Footballer of the Year titles.\n\nFaith in the Future With Arne Slot’s Reds\n\nThe Egyptian star spoke with real conviction after signing:\n\n“Of course I’m very excited. We have a great team now. Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football.”\n\n.@MoSalah has signed a new contract that will keep him with the club beyond the 2024-25 season 😁🔴 — Liverpool FC (@LFC) April 11, 2025\n\n“It’s great, I had my best years here. I played eight years, hopefully it’s going to be 10… I believe we can win a lot of big trophies together.”\n\nThis isn’t just about extending a contract – it’s about unfinished business. Salah wants more silverware, and he believes Liverpool under Slot can deliver.\n\nEnduring Bond With The Kop\n\nThere’s a reason Salah continues to be adored by Liverpool fans. It’s not just the goals – it’s the heart. He’s been the constant through transitions, lifting the team when it mattered most. His message to the fans sums it up:\n\n“Keep supporting us and we’ll give it our best, and hopefully in the future we’re going to win more trophies.”\n\nWith Salah staying, that hope feels more like expectation.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThis is massive. Not just for Liverpool, but for what it says about the mindset inside the dressing room. Salah could have cashed in, moved on, chased one last payday. But he didn’t. He believes in this team, in Arne Slot’s vision, and in the fans who have backed him for nearly a decade.\n\nThis isn’t nostalgia – it’s ambition. Salah’s still delivering world-class performances, and his numbers speak louder than any headline. He’s the top scorer in the league. He’s setting up his teammates. He’s leading by example.\n\nWith Klopp’s era over, this is the anchor Liverpool needed. Salah’s commitment buys Slot time, it sends confidence through the squad, and it shows everyone that Liverpool are not in a rebuilding phase – they’re still in the fight. And if this season’s stats are anything to go by, they’re not just in the fight… they might be leading it.\n\nAs fans, we couldn’t ask for more. He’s already a legend, and now he’s giving us more time to sing his name. “Mo Salah, Mo Salah…” – we’re not done yet."}

But while many names have been floated across the rumour mill, Daily Mail journalist Lewis Steele has cast doubt over two of the more frequently mentioned players — Liam Delap of Ipswich Town and João Pedro of Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nSpeaking on the Media Matters podcast hosted by Dave Davis for Anfield Index, Steele gave detailed insight into why both forwards are not currently seen as serious options for Liverpool.\n\nLiam Delap Not High on Liverpool’s List\n\nDelap, currently on loan at Ipswich from Manchester City, has attracted interest from several Premier League sides including Manchester United and Chelsea. However, according to Steele, Liverpool’s interest is minimal.\n\n“Man United and Chelsea seem to be the ones that are in the forefront of that race,” said Steele. “He’s very good, but from what I heard, he’s not anywhere near the top of Liverpool’s list at this current moment in time.”\n\nWhile Delap’s potential and affordability may appeal if multiple strikers were to leave, Steele added: “If two strikers were to leave and they needed two, then maybe… but I do think you can sort of put a pencil through his name at the moment.”\n\nJoão Pedro’s Goal Record a Concern\n\nOn the subject of João Pedro, the Brazilian forward has been linked with multiple top-flight clubs thanks to his versatility and performances for Brighton. Yet Steele cast doubt over his suitability for Liverpool’s requirements.\n\n“As far as I’m aware, I don’t think that is one [Liverpool are targeting] at the moment,” Steele explained. “Pedro’s goal record isn’t as good as the other people in this conversation either.”\n\nHighlighting a specific weakness, Steele added, “I don’t know if he scores enough goals to lead the line for a team like Liverpool — especially non-penalty goals. I’ve had him in my fantasy team for a while and he’s been letting me down.”\n\nLiverpool’s Striker Search Still Evolving\n\nWhile neither Delap nor Pedro appear to be at the forefront, Liverpool’s striker shortlist remains fluid. “I don’t really like saying no to any of them because obviously it’s April and things can change,” Steele noted. “There’s plenty of other people that Liverpool will be watching at this current moment in time.”\n\nWith transfer priorities expected to sharpen after the title race concludes, and with potential exits looming — particularly in the case of Darwin Núñez — Liverpool will be looking at a variety of options, likely favouring strikers with a proven goalscoring record in elite competition.\n\nSteele also hinted that the club has “probably been drawing up that shortlist for quite a while,” and that key decisions will likely align with the earlier-than-usual summer window, which opens due to the Club World Cup.\n\nNo Pen Through, But Pencil Lines Are Drawn\n\nIn classic fashion, Steele stopped short of ruling out any moves entirely, stating: “Don’t want to rule anyone out with a pen in case things change.” However, in the cases of Delap and Pedro, it’s clear they are not front-runners.\n\nAs Liverpool build for the future under Arne Slot, their striker pursuit will be strategic and data-driven — and for now, the likes of Delap and Pedro seem more like names for the rumour columns than the recruitment boardroom."}

What’s perhaps most fascinating, though, is not just the progress—but the restraint. Rather than blowing up what Klopp left behind, Slot has worked with and refined an elite group. That cohesion now looks set to continue with the club captain Virgil van Dijk preparing to extend his stay at Anfield for two more years, as reported by BBC Sport.\n\nIt’s more than just contract news—it’s strategic clarity. Until now, Liverpool’s summer planning had hovered over uncertainty. What happens if the towering Dutchman moves on? That question had already sparked serious contingency measures, and the answers, in the form of Marc Guehi and Dean Huijsen, offered a glimpse into the club’s future-facing thinking.\n\nDefensive Rebuild Considered in Van Dijk’s Shadow\n\nThere’s no truly replicating Virgil van Dijk. His calm authority, precise distribution, and aerial dominance remain unrivalled. Even Liverpool’s own analysis acknowledged the impossibility of replacing him in like-for-like terms. Instead, the recruitment team set about identifying those who could at least occupy the same side of the pitch with similar confidence.\n\nMarc Guehi—Crystal Palace’s captain—and Dean Huijsen of Bournemouth were highlighted as the two most serious targets. According to BBC Sport, both were being “analysed” for their ability to operate on the left of a back two. Guehi, in particular, has been linked with Liverpool for over two years, and his England credentials and consistent Premier League form make him a tempting prospect.\n\nStill, the cost was eye-watering. Tottenham had a £70m bid turned down in February. Though his contract situation may drop that fee slightly, Palace are unlikely to let him go on the cheap.\n\nContract Clarity Brings Calm\n\nUltimately, Van Dijk staying gives Liverpool breathing space. They no longer need to overpay for a player like Guehi out of desperation. Slot and sporting director Richard Hughes now move forward with authority, not ambiguity.\n\nInstead of replacing a legend, they can begin developing the next generation under his watchful eye. It’s a quieter but perhaps wiser path forward.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool supporters, the Van Dijk contract news feels like a corner turned. The idea of life without the Dutch colossus was anxiety-inducing—not just for what he offers on the pitch, but what his presence signals to teammates and fans alike. He’s the spine of this side. His decision to stay, at a time when many assumed he’d depart post-Klopp, speaks volumes about Slot’s influence and the belief brewing behind the scenes.\n\nAs for Marc Guehi, he’s a decent player—strong, reliable, and Premier League-tested. But £70m for someone still short of world-class feels off-brand for Liverpool, who rarely pay premium for the sake of it. It would’ve been a panic move, not a plotted one.\n\nDean Huijsen, by contrast, feels more in line with the strategy: younger, developing, high-ceiling. If he can learn from Van Dijk up close, Liverpool may find themselves with a successor who evolves naturally, rather than one bought to imitate.\n\nWhat’s clear is this: Liverpool didn’t blink when faced with uncertainty. That steadiness could be the foundation for another sustained era at the top."}

Speaking on Media Matters for Anfield Index, Daily Mail journalist Lewis Steele offered crucial insight into Van Dijk’s contract situation, revealing how close the Dutch defender is to putting pen to paper.\n\nVan Dijk Contract “Very Close” According to Lewis Steele\n\nAppearing alongside host Dave Davis, Lewis Steele revealed that Liverpool’s defensive lynchpin is “very close” to signing a new contract with the club. “Virgil said to us in the mix zone that there was progress made on his contract,” Steele explained. “The word I got back on that was, yeah, that is very close as well. Not done, again not official, nothing signed, but it is getting very close.”\n\nThis sentiment echoed earlier murmurs surrounding Mohamed Salah, whose deal is now confirmed. Steele’s reporting throughout the week had teased progress, but he was keen to stress that despite excitement, caution still applied. “Not officially signed but it will be soon,” he said on Van Dijk. “It’s just when, not if.”\n\nTiming the Announcement\n\nThough Van Dijk’s commitment is imminent, the club appears strategic in its timing. “I don’t know whether they might wait until the title’s officially wrapped up before they do that,” said Steele, suggesting Liverpool may hold announcements until after the Premier League is secured.\n\nThis measured approach mirrors Liverpool’s handling of Arne Slot’s managerial appointment. “Everyone knew that he was going to be the manager, but it didn’t officially get announced until… like May or June,” Steele recalled. With Van Dijk’s deal all but agreed, the timing now hinges on club optics rather than negotiation.\n\nDouble Boost for Liverpool’s Future\n\nIn discussing both star players, Steele remarked, “They’re both closing in on signing that deal, which puts an end to a very long-running saga… it sounds like it’s done and we can all forget about all the different debates we’ve had.” The parallel timing of Salah and Van Dijk’s deals is seen as deliberate, a statement of intent under new sporting director Richard Hughes.\n\n“Give credit to Richard Hughes on this,” Steele added. “He’s inherited the situation of these three players—the three best players—out of contract.” Hughes’ success in securing two of the three (with Trent Alexander-Arnold’s future still uncertain) represents a major stabilising force at Anfield.\n\nVan Dijk Rejects Outside Interest\n\nDespite strong interest from top European clubs, Steele reported that Van Dijk’s desire to stay was never in question. “Virgil had a lot of interest from around Europe as well… but they both wanted to stay, Liverpool wanted them to stay, Arne Slot wanted them to stay,” he said. “Well done to everyone involved for getting them done finally.”\n\nIt’s a sentiment that should resonate strongly with Liverpool fans. At 32, Van Dijk remains arguably the best defender in world football. “He’s not the best defender in the world—Van Dijk is the best defender in the world,” Steele underlined, in comparing other squad members."}

It was more January time. They like him.” While not definitively stating that the 21-year-old French forward is Liverpool’s top choice, the interest is far from casual. Steele clarified, “I don’t think it’s advanced… but he is one that they’ve watched.”\n\nSlot’s System and Squad Evolution\n\nThe conversation naturally flowed toward how any incoming attacker might fit into Arne Slot’s plans. Though Slot was only mentioned briefly, the undercurrent of tactical suitability was clear. “There’s a lot of thoughts at Liverpool about how much they can adapt in terms of forwards,” Steele noted, alluding to the evolving front line under new leadership.\n\nAnd it’s not just Ekitike on the radar. Steele brought context to Liverpool’s wider approach: “They’ve done the work on five or six [strikers] — not all of them are going to come in, but they want to be in a position where if a player becomes available… they can move quickly.”\n\nNo Rush, But Prepared for Opportunity\n\nOne of the standout messages from Steele was the club’s readiness rather than urgency. “It’s not a case of: ‘we need a number nine’ — they might look for one, but it’s got to be the right opportunity.” With Liverpool not desperate for an out-and-out striker, the emphasis is clearly on fit, finances, and flexibility.\n\nInterestingly, Steele also hinted at a strategic patience: “They don’t want to get dragged into an auction… They’ve done their due diligence on a few — they’re just waiting to see what shakes out.”\n\nMedia Matters Keeps it Real\n\nThroughout the Media Matters episode, Davis steered the conversation with sharp, insightful prompts, allowing Steele to paint a picture of Liverpool’s approach grounded in realism and restraint. There was no hyperbole, no far-fetched gossip — just factual reporting and balanced analysis.\n\nAnd in that spirit, the mention of Hugo Ekitike feels more like a breadcrumb than a banner headline. Liverpool are watching, waiting — but as always, the timing and terms must align."}

Behind the scenes, negotiations are unfolding that will shape not only the club’s short-term stability but also its long-term identity. Dave Davis, speaking to Trev Downey on Anfield Index, revealed some surprising details that suggest Liverpool have serious decisions to make on two of their most promising talents: Curtis Jones and Conor Bradley.\n\nAs Davis shared: “The info I have got over the last few days surprised me about Jones’ situation.” That statement alone hints at something more than the usual contract haggling.\n\nCurtis Jones and the Cost of Being Local\n\nCurtis Jones has two years remaining on his current contract, but it’s not business as usual. According to Davis, “Curtis Jones has turned down Liverpool’s latest contract offer.” For a player who has grown up at the club, come through the ranks, and is now an England international, that’s a red flag.\n\n“He has just two years left on his contract and he will be the ‘Scouser in the team’ once Trent Alexander-Arnold does leave.” It’s a poignant note. Jones, at just the right age, is supposed to be the heartbeat of the next generation. Yet, he’s looking around the dressing room and seeing Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch, and Dominik Szoboszlai on six-figure salaries.\n\n“So again, he is going to be looking at their deals and thinks he is worth that value,” Davis added. He’s not wrong. Performance-wise, Jones has shown he can mix it with the best, but Liverpool appear to be betting on sentiment instead of putting their money where their mouth is. As Davis said, “I expect that one to get done because he loves Liverpool and wants to stay, but FSG aren’t going to get away with this cheaply.”\n\nConor Bradley: No Longer the Apprentice\n\nJones isn’t alone in facing this contractual limbo. Conor Bradley, who could soon step into the vacated role of first-choice right-back, is in a similarly delicate position.\n\n“It’s similar for Conor Bradley, who also has a couple of years left,” said Davis. And it matters more now than ever, especially given Trent Alexander-Arnold’s reported £400,000-per-week rejection. If Trent is preparing for an eventual exit, Liverpool’s reliance on Bradley is not just hopeful—it’s essential.\n\nBut the club’s opening gambit was tone-deaf. “The first offer Liverpool made to Conor Bradley was literally laughed at because it was that small.” In football economics, his current wage—reportedly around £10,000-per-week—is paltry. Even doubling that would be “nothing,” as Davis put it bluntly.\n\n“All of the chips are on Bradley’s side of the table and he will want Liverpool to prove that they want him.” And rightly so. If he’s the future of the right-back slot, Liverpool must act like it.\n\nValue, Vision and a Club at a Crossroads\n\nThere’s a trend emerging here. For all the talk of data-led decisions and smart recruitment under FSG, the club sometimes underestimates the human side of football. These aren’t just assets on a spreadsheet—they are symbols of the club’s present and future identity.\n\n“At two-years left, you want to avoid all of these situations,” Davis rightly pointed out. Waiting too long can sour relationships, drive down market value, or worse—lead to exits. Just ask fans still lamenting Gini Wijnaldum’s departure.\n\nJones and Bradley aren’t just homegrown players—they are ambassadors of what Liverpool should represent. And if Arne Slot is to continue his tenure on solid ground, these are precisely the types of players he’ll want to have committed and happy.\n\nLiverpool still expect both contracts to get done. But as Davis made clear, “they won’t get it on the cheap.” Nor should they. Loyalty in football today is rare. When it comes from your own, pay it forward."}

The announcement that Mohamed Salah has signed a new two-year contract is not just a continuation of a stellar Anfield legacy, but a clear signal of intent under Arne Slot’s stewardship.\n\nSlot, speaking to the press ahead of Liverpool’s clash with West Ham United, didn’t attempt to conceal his satisfaction. “Happy, of course,” he said. “He’s shown at this club for so many years in a row now how much value he has for the team [and] for the club.” In an era where top players often chase fresh challenges, Salah’s commitment is emblematic of belief in the project at hand.\n\nSalah’s Enduring Brilliance\n\nSince arriving in 2017, Mohamed Salah has transformed into a modern icon at Anfield – and his stats alone tell only half the story. Slot pointed not only to Salah’s relentless output in front of goal but also to his unmatched consistency and mentality.\n\n“He can score a goal if he is not in the best half-hour or the best 15 minutes,” Slot explained. “That’s why he is mentally so strong… you need to be that if you want to be seven or eight years at the highest level every three or four days.”\n\nThis mental strength, coupled with Salah’s physical resilience and technical brilliance, is what allows him to maintain such a high level. It’s no longer about development but refinement. Slot admitted as much: “There’s not a lot of room for improvement for Mo… They are just trying to reach perfection.”\n\nMessage Sent: Liverpool Mean Business\n\nThere’s also a strategic edge to this renewal. Slot hinted that while fans may have been surprised, the club were quietly confident for some time. He credited Richard Hughes, Liverpool’s sporting director, for navigating the contract process smoothly, praising him for securing a player “who as a free agent can go probably to every club in the world.”\n\nBy keeping Salah, Liverpool not only retain one of world football’s most decisive attackers, but they also strengthen their position in future negotiations—whether for extending contracts or attracting new players.\n\n“It gives a positive vibe towards the club,” Slot said. “It also shows maybe how ambitious this club is… that we are really ambitious to keep performing the way this club has performed for so many years.”\n\nSlot’s Evolving Vision\n\nWhat makes Arne Slot’s tenure already compelling is how he blends continuity with innovation. Salah’s continued presence offers a bridge between Liverpool’s golden Klopp era and whatever comes next. But Slot is under no illusions that the Egyptian will remain unchallenged or untouched tactically.\n\nHe acknowledged Salah may not dominate every minute and compared him to global peers: “If I look at all the wingers all around the world, they are not 90 minutes outplaying their opponent every single time… it’s then normal that once in a while you lose the ball or one of your actions fail.”\n\nSlot views Salah not in isolation but as part of an evolving attacking unit. With Cody Gakpo and Luis Diaz also thriving, Liverpool’s flanks remain as dangerous as ever—especially as modern football trends increasingly favour dynamic wingers capable of unlocking compact defences.\n\nWhy Salah Still Matters\n\nIn an age of constant change, Salah’s renewal is a rare moment of stability and clarity. It reinforces Liverpool’s belief in their core values: high-intensity football, elite mentality, and trust in those who’ve delivered consistently.\n\nSlot’s admiration for Salah goes beyond footballing ability. “He is a humble person [who] always wants to work hard, always puts a lot of effort in… and he wants to stay at that level.” That humility and professionalism set the tone for younger players, even as Salah nears what Slot diplomatically called “the end of his ability” — a reference not to decline, but to the ceiling of elite performance.\n\nWith his future settled, Salah now has the platform to add another chapter to his Liverpool legacy. And under Arne Slot, that chapter might just be as significant as anything that came before."}

He also accused The Washington Post and the New York Times, along with French outlets Le Figaro and Le Monde, of being “fake news,” echoing President Donald Trump’s characterization of the media.\n\n“We actually did not fully control the financial flows of these funds, and that was the reason why such notorious institutions like the National Democratic Institute (NDI) were actually plotting a coup d’état here,” Aliyev said during the forum. “It was detected. We traced more than 1 million US dollars from a bank account, which was cashed out, and then we found part of that money in rented apartments of opposition activists, together with Molotov cocktails and instructions on how to attack government buildings, how to attack policemen.”\n\nThe Azerbaijani president also claimed that, following the end of President Joe Biden’s term, news outlets “stopped publishing all the ugly articles about Azerbaijan.” He also claimed that the source of the articles were from the State Department.\n\nSo far, Aliyev has not produced concrete evidence to support his charges.

The Insurrection Act grants U.S. presidents the power to deploy the military into states for civilian law enforcement.\n\nTo share the rumor, users copied and pasted the text from the first (archived) in a series of articles written by a Medium.com blogger only identified by the handle of Aletheisthenes.\n\nThe rumor partly pertained to a Trump executive order issued on Jan. 20 declaring a national emergency at the southern U.S. border. Part of that order requested Trump to receive a joint report from the secretaries of defense and homeland security \"within 90 days\" — or by April 20 — advising \" whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.\" The order did not explicitly mention the words \"martial law.\"\n\nWhile Aletheisthenes, the author of the series of articles, featured at length a wealth of data about Trump's past actions, as well as information about the Insurrection Act of 1807 and martial law, this rumor existed more as a prediction than a provable claim.\n\nThe Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not yet respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\nIn April 2025, online users shared a rumor claiming U.S. President Donald Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 and then declare martial law — a declaration of rule enforced by military authorities. According to numerous posts, this sequences of events would begin on or just after April 20, the same day as Easter Sunday.\n\nFor example, one Facebook user posted, in part, \"He's setting us up for Martial Law....just in case y'all were wondering how he plans on dealing with the backlash he's receiving. April 20.\" Another user sharing the rumor, also noting former German dictator Adolf Hitler's birthday as April 20, wrote, in part, \"Upcoming MAGA special events... April 20. Trump declares martial law in The United States of America.\"\n\nThe mentions of April 20 pertained to a Jan. 20 executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern U.S. border. One part of the order said that the secretaries of defense and homeland security would issue a joint report \"within 90 days,\" meaning by April 20. It further stated that the report would include guidance about \"whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.\" The order did not explicitly mention the words \"martial law.\"\n\nAs of this writing on April 11, this rumor existed more as a prediction than a provable claim. Searches of the websites for the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and the White House yielded no announcements, statements or demonstrable evidence that might help to shed light on the unproven matter.\n\nThose entities did not yet respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\nBreaking down the martial law rumor\n\nUsers on Bluesky, Facebook, Reddit and other social platforms shared the rumor either in their own words or as a lengthy block of copied-and-pasted text. That text originated from a March 21 article (archived) reported on the publishing platform Medium.com. The author did not self-identify in any other way other than by the handle Aletheisthenes.\n\n(Angela Woodward/Facebook)\n\nAletheisthenes' article — the first in a series (archived) of stories titled, \"The Coup Playbook: How They Quietly Kill the Constitution and Democracy in the Coming Weeks and Months\" — began with, \"On April 20, 2025, the United States may initiate its final steps into authoritarian rule.\"\n\nIn the article, Aletheisthenes predicted several supposed chronological steps following the invocation of the act and martial law, including \"expanded martial law\" following violent false flag operations at otherwise peaceful protests, arrests of journalists and politicians, military takeovers of major U.S. cities, press censorship, closed borders and postponed elections. The author ended the article, \"If we don't act before April 20, then by April 23, it will already be too late.\"\n\nSubsequent articles in the series featured Aletheisthenes discussing many other matters related to the predictions, including for example advising (archived) readers to prepare for the worst by buying survival supplies, water and food, and to \"beat the rush,\" \"go fast\" and \"go now.\" In another article, the author asked (archived) readers to use artificial-intelligence (AI) platforms to \"check my math.\"\n\nInterviewing Aletheisthenes\n\nBy email, the author who made the predictions answered several questions regarding the primary claim examined for this story — one positing Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act and then declare martial law. The author also was presented with a legal article that seemed to contradict the blog posts.\n\nThat article (archived) by Joseph Nunn, counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, states the Insurrection Act does not authorize martial law.\n\n\"The term 'martial law' has no established definition, but it is generally understood as a power that allows the military to take over the role of civilian government in an emergency,\" Nunn wrote on the matter in 2022. \"By contrast, the Insurrection Act generally permits the military to assist civilian authorities (whether state or federal), not take their place. Under current law, the president has no authority to declare martial law.\"\n\nWhen presented with Nunn's article, Aletheisthenes said, in part, that \"Trump has a history of testing what he can and can't do.\" The blogger also added, \"Trump is on record on wanting to declare martial law several times during his [first] administration,\" and that his \"guardrails\" from his first administration \"are gone.\"\n\nA search for information about Trump previously considering declaring martial law located a Dec. 19, 2020, article from The New York Times. The reporting said Trump discussed the idea of declaring martial law to \"rerun\" the election he had just lost, during an Oval Office meeting occurring on Dec. 18. Trump tweeted (archived) in response, \"Martial law = Fake News. Just more knowingly bad reporting!\" Trump also previously threatened in June 2020 to send federal forces to quell protests and violence following the death of George Floyd, a matter involving invoking the Insurrection Act.\n\nAletheisthenes also answered a question about changing the word \"will\" to \"may\" in the headline of the first article. The headline originally read, \"On April 20th, 2025, the United States will Cross the Point of No Return.\" The blogger answered, in part, \"I decided to tone it down,\" citing a person who called the blogger \"a malicious propagandist giving paranoid nutjobs nightmare fuel.\"\n\nWhen asked about whether Aletheisthenes purchased survival supplies — the advice the blogger gave to readers in Part Four (archived) of the series of articles — Aletheisthenes answered, \"Yes. I've never been a prepper before. But I did something different: I'm in a better financial position than many, and I actually ordered 6 months of survival rations and a pretty serious water filter. I figure we'll be feeding the neighbors.\n\n\"My intentions are good, at least in my own mind. Actually, I don't think I've ever done anything more important in my life, trying to get the word out and save our Constitution ... although it may already be too late. But at least if things go bad I know I tried. And maybe in some way I've gotten more people talking about it. And maybe by talking about it... it'll stop it from happening. And I just look like a crazy man. Which ... I can live with.\"\n\nA representative for Nunn, counsel with the Brennan Center for Justice, did not yet reply to an emailed request for further comment.\n\nInsurrection Act of 1807\n\nThe Library of Congress hosts the original text of the Insurrection Act of 1807 on Page 443 (archived) of legislation pertaining to the Ninth Congress. As of 2025, the act exists in its amended form in Title 10 of the U.S. Code. (The Trump-issued executive order from Jan. 20 specifically featured the words \"Insurrection Act of 1807,\" rather than generally referencing the matter as the \"Insurrection Act.\")\n\nThe original text from 1807 read as follows:\n\nChap. XXXIX. — An Act authorizing the employment of the land and naval forces of the United States, in cases of insurrections. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in all cases of insurrection, or obstruction to the laws, either of the United States, or of any individual state or territory, where it is lawful for the President of the United States to call forth the militia for the purpose of suppressing such insurrection, or of causing the laws to be duly executed, it shall be lawful for him to employ, for the same purposes, such part of the land or naval force of the United States, as shall be judged necessary, having first observed all the prerequisites of the law in that respect. Approved, March 3, 1807\n\nPresident Thomas Jefferson, in office from 1801 through 1809, introduced the act in response to fears that his former vice president, Aaron Burr, might incite a rebellion or insurrection after Jefferson replaced him for Jefferson's second term in the White House.\n\nNunn reported for the Brennan Center that \"the Insurrection Act was last invoked in 1992, when the governor of California requested military aid from President George H.W. Bush in response to civil unrest in Los Angeles that followed the acquittal of four white police officers charged with beating Black motorist Rodney King.\" The Brennan Center published a list of the many other times U.S. presidents invoked the Insurrection Act."}

GLP-1 medications, originally developed to treat diabetes, have gained widespread attention for their ability to support weight loss by curbing hunger and cravings. Researchers are even exploring GLP-1s for conditions beyond diabetes and weight loss—like heart disease and substance use disorders—because of their potential to reduce the drive to consume addictive substances. Weekly, dozens of articles highlight their promise in addiction treatment.\n\nBut as excitement builds around what’s next, we risk overlooking what’s already here. For decades, a safe, affordable, and effective treatment for addiction has existed, yet it remains largely underused: naltrexone.\n\nWhat Is Naltrexone?\n\nFirst developed 60 years ago, naltrexone is a once-daily pill (or monthly injection) that is approved by the FDA to treat both alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and opioid use disorders (OUDs). It works by targeting the brain’s opioid system, a key part of the reward pathway that makes alcohol and opioids feel rewarding. When someone drinks or uses drugs, the brain releases chemicals like dopamine, which produce feelings of pleasure and reduce both physical and emotional discomfort. Naltrexone blocks these effects, dulling the sense of reward that comes from substance use. For someone who drinks, that means the usual pleasure or “buzz” from alcohol is dampened. For someone who uses opioids, naltrexone, which is an opioid “antagonist,” prevents the high entirely. By taking away the reward, the urge to drink or use can be significantly reduced. Over time, alcohol or opioids become less pleasurable, and addictive behaviors may begin to fade.\n\nImportantly, people do not have to be abstinent from alcohol to start taking naltrexone. It can support gradual reduction in alcohol use, making treatment more accessible to those who might not fit into traditional, abstinence-only models. It’s also been shown to reduce binge drinking, which many individuals seek to moderate without necessarily aiming for full sobriety.\n\nIs Naltrexone Effective?\n\nResearch has shown that naltrexone can significantly improve outcomes for people with AUD, reducing the chances of returning to heavy drinking​. Even when someone does drink, naltrexone helps them drink less and helps prevent potential brief recurrences that could turn into a full return to use. For opioid addiction, naltrexone can be life-saving. By blocking the effects of opioids, it removes the “high,” which can deter use and support ongoing recovery. It can also be a valuable option for individuals who can’t or don’t want to use the other gold-standard opioid-based treatments like methadone or buprenorphine. Each avoided binge, brief recurrence, or full return to use is meaningful, and for many, naltrexone makes those wins possible.\n\nIn 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) added naltrexone to its list of essential medicines for treating AUDs. It’s also recommended as a first-line treatment in clinical guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and other professional bodies for alcohol dependence.\n\nThe most common side effects are relatively minor – nausea, headache, or fatigue, especially in the first couple of weeks – though they often resolve with time. There’s no risk of addiction with naltrexone, and it doesn’t make people drowsy or impair their ability to function normally. However, it’s important to note that the medication is not appropriate for everyone, including people using opioid pain medications (as it blocks the effects of opioids) and should be used with caution in individuals with severe liver disease.\n\nWhy Don’t More People Get This Medication?\n\nNaltrexone has minimal side effects, is well tolerated, and is easy to take. Yet despite its proven benefits, less than 2% of people with AUD receive this medication, even in the most coordinated systems of care. Some studies show prescribing rates as low as 5% during alcohol-related healthcare visits. Meanwhile, an estimated 28.9 million people ages 12 and older had AUD in the past year. So why the disconnect?\n\nOne major barrier is stigma, fueled by outdated beliefs that recovery should happen without medications. Patients and even providers may feel that using medication for a SUD is “cheating” or not addressing the “real issue.\" The reality is that addiction is a complex brain disease, not a moral failing—and there’s no shame in using effective medication to support recovery.\n\nAnother challenge is a lack of awareness and training. Many general physicians receive little to no training in addiction medicine. They might not think to offer naltrexone, or may feel uncertain about how to bring it up with a patient. But any licensed prescriber can write for naltrexone—no special waiver or certification is needed. While education efforts are underway, much more needs to be done to equip providers with the tools to talk confidently about medication options.\n\nPatient awareness is another key gap. Many people struggling with alcohol or opioids simply don’t know that a medication like naltrexone exists, let alone that it could help them cut back or stay on track. Public awareness is slowly improving; some headlines have even started referring to naltrexone as the “Ozempic for alcohol” because of its ability to reduce cravings​. Catchy comparisons can get people’s attention, but real impact comes when front-line providers routinely bring up the option. When doctors and therapists normalize talking about medication options, patients are much more likely to consider them.\n\nUse the Full Toolbox to Treat Addiction\n\nEveryone who seeks help for addiction deserves access to all the tools that might support their recovery. Therapy, support groups, lifestyle changes, and medications all have a place in that toolbox. Naltrexone is one tool—a powerful one—that should be utilized more widely. It’s not a magic cure (no single treatment is), but it can meaningfully tip the scales in the patient’s favor.\n\nJust as people have embraced new solutions for weight loss and other health challenges, healthcare providers need to embrace existing medications for addiction with the same openness. In the end, the goal is simple: to help people get better. Naltrexone alone won’t solve the addiction crisis, but when it’s part of a comprehensive plan, it can save lives and aid recovery."}

I now read most scientific articles through a new lens that tries to see what this tells us about our stress response system.\n\nSo, when I read an article this week about the effects of the pregnant mother’s sleep on the development of her child, I saw another light shine on the mystery of how stress gets passed from one generation to the next. At first glance, it may seem enough to note that troubled parents often raise troubled children. We know that growing up in any unsafe environment, whether it is an abusive family, a high-crime neighborhood, or as the object of repeated discrimination, can set up patterns of stress that are hard for growing children to break out of, especially if they’re poor.\n\nNow, thanks to this article, we can add to the list of pathways by which stress can be passed down from generation to generation—trauma, role modeling, unsafe living environments, genes—a less intuitively obvious pathway: sleep. Disturbed sleep, if it persists for months, is one pathway to excessive stress for all of us. We need restful sleep to regulate our stress response systems.\n\nFor pregnant women, morning sickness during the first trimester and physical discomfort during the third trimester make insomnia a common nuisance. Or is prenatal insomnia more than a nuisance?\n\nThe Review\n\nA systematic review published in January of this year brings into focus the collected studies on how the pregnant mother’s sleep may affect the later health of her infant and child. Since we already have evidence that poor sleep during pregnancy increases the risk for pre-term births and low birth weights, the question this review asks is whether the effect of a mother’s poor sleep during pregnancy extends beyond birth. Does prenatal maternal sleep shape child development?\n\nTo explore this question, a team of researchers from the University of Denver and the University of California, Irvine, collected the results of 34 original peer-reviewed studies, most of them published between 2019 and 2024. These studies measured prenatal sleep patterns in the mother and then some measure of the offspring’s health or development during infancy or childhood. Following rigorous methods for analyzing collections of observational studies, this review found some notable patterns.\n\nFirst, poor sleep in the pregnant mother predicted poor sleep in the infant or child—that is, shorter sleep durations, more night awakenings, more daytime sleep, and more hospital admissions for sleep disorders. Every mother knows how intimately tied her sleep is to the sleep patterns of her child.\n\nSecond, poor sleep in the pregnant mother predicted a higher chance that the child would be overweight or obese, have high blood pressure, or develop respiratory allergies.\n\nAnd third, poor sleep in the pregnant mother predicted higher risks for childhood development problems, such as crying and fussiness, ADHD, or language delays.\n\nThese findings suggest that the sleep habits of the pregnant mother may affect the sleep habits of her child well after birth, including important aspects of physical and cognitive development.\n\nThough this review finds some surprising effects lasting into childhood years, it’s important to recognize a few limitations of this study before thinking about what we should do differently. Though 70% percent of these 34 studies were rated at least moderately rigorous in their methods, only 9% were rated highly rigorous. And many studies only measured either the mother’s sleep or the childhood outcomes once, whereas several measures would give a more robust picture of each. So, these findings need to be confirmed by more rigorous studies.\n\nThe Impacts\n\nIn the meantime, we can put this review to use in everyday life by giving higher priority to the mother’s sleep during pregnancy. Here’s another example of science confirming conventional wisdom. Though we don’t yet have evidence that effective sleep management during pregnancy prevents these poor health outcomes in infancy and childhood–-the clinical trials have not yet been done—pregnant women should insist their prenatal care clinicians give their insomnia high priority for effective remedies. Sleep medicine services could open fast tracks for pregnant women ahead of their waiting lists.\n\nHelping a pregnant mother sleep restfully offers another way to invest in the future generation.\n\nBut wait. Does it make sense to you that something as common and tolerable as insomnia should have lasting effects on the child’s physical and mental health? It makes sense to me only if the insomnia is a sign of the mother’s dysregulated stress response system, since regular restful sleep is one of the essentials for keeping our stress response systems healthy. Future studies should consider the possibility that the mother’s dysregulated sleep preceded the pregnancy and continued after the birth, passing her toxic form of stress along to the next generation by genes or by example, or both."}

This strategy has enabled nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging and other quantum applications. But a long-standing challenge has been to target a specific nuclear spin, while protecting the delicate quantum nature of the electron spin. Important progress on this challenge has now been achieved by two teams at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands [1, 2].\n\nTim Taminiau and his colleagues developed a generalized and improved way to execute so-called dynamically decoupled radio-frequency protocols [1]. In these protocols, the electron spin is subjected to microwave pulses that periodically flip its state. This process decouples the spin from its environment, preserving its fragile quantum properties. The spin is then exposed to radio-frequency pulses that reintroduce its interactions with only one selected nuclear spin. The researchers’ new approach boosts the performance of these protocols in sensing and controlling individual nuclear spins in various systems. It also offers valuable insights into the efficiency and selectivity of such operations.\n\nRonald Hanson and his colleagues used some of these insights to manipulate nuclear spins in a specific system [2]. Harnessing the electron spin of a crystal defect known as a tin-vacancy center in a diamond, the team controlled the nuclear spins of the surrounding carbon-13 atoms in the diamond’s crystal lattice. This demonstration is especially important because, unlike other crystal defects that have two or more unpaired electrons, tin-vacancy centers have only one. Such single-electron systems are among the most promising platforms for quantum technologies, but until now, it has been difficult to use the electron spin of one of these centers to target a specific nuclear spin.\n\n–Ryan Wilkinson\n\nRyan Wilkinson is a Corresponding Editor for Physics Magazine based in Durham, UK."}

Others alleged the U.S. government was \"making support for Israel and Judaism a requirement for US citizenship\" or that the citizenship agency would \"deny immigration benefits to anyone whose social media expresses a verboten opinion on Palestine.\"\n\nIt was not yet clear whether DHS' announcement — available on the agency's website — means people may be denied U.S. citizenship on the basis of their criticism of Israel, although U.S. immigration officials already have targeted pro-Palestinian demonstrators for removal from the country. While the announcement does not explicitly apply to those seeking citizenship, it does pertain to people seeking \"lawful permanent residence status,\" which is often a required step before applying for citizenship.\n\nIn an emailed statement, DHS said its definition of \"antisemitic activity\" will align with President Donald Trump's executive orders on antisemitism; an order of his from 2019, during his first term, affirmed the United States' 2016 adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's \"working definition\" of antisemitism, which states that antisemitism includes the \"targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity,\" but that not all criticisms of Israel are antisemitic.\n\nSnopes previously published a collection of explainers on the Israel-Hamas war to help readers make sense of the conflict and the history between Israel and Palestine that led up to it.\n\nBreaking down DHS' announcement\n\nThe April 9 news release from DHS read in part (emphasis ours):\n\nToday U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will begin considering aliens' antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests. This will immediately affect aliens applying for lawful permanent resident status, foreign students and aliens affiliated with educational institutions linked to antisemitic activity. Consistent with President Trump's executive orders on Combatting Anti-Semitism, Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism and Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats, DHS will enforce all relevant immigration laws to the maximum degree, to protect the homeland from extremists and terrorist aliens, including those who support antisemitic terrorism, violent antisemitic ideologies and antisemitic terrorist organizations such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, or Ansar Allah aka: \"the Houthis.\" […] Under this guidance, USCIS will consider social media content that indicates an alien endorsing, espousing, promoting, or supporting antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organizations, or other antisemitic activity as a negative factor in any USCIS discretionary analysis when adjudicating immigration benefit requests. This guidance is effective immediately.\n\nDHS did not explicitly say peaceful protest against Israel or support of Palestinian self-determination, for example, are considered \"antisemitic activity,\" instead listing various groups designated terrorism organizations by the United States, including Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has vowed to overthrow Israel. Furthermore, the definition of antisemitism Trump's 2019 executive order officially endorsed states that \"criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's administration has already detained lawful permanent residents and students on visas for pro-Palestinian speech or activity, claiming — often without evidence , at least among the widely reported cases — that the detainees had ties to or supported Hamas.\n\nFurthermore, another executive order Trump signed on Jan. 29, 2025, reaffirmed his 2019 order and specifically referenced pro-Palestinian demonstrations on student campuses, claiming Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel \"unleashed an unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence against our citizens, especially in our schools and on our campuses.\"\n\nIn the order, Trump instructed officials to determine what actions each U.S. agency can take to \"curb or combat anti-Semitism\" and review \"all pending administrative complaints … against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism.\"\n\nMany of the students and scholars the Trump administration targeted publicly spoke out against Israel's reported human rights violations against Palestinians and Israel's ongoing occupation of Gaza. The Trump administration also has faced criticism for \"weaponizing antisemitism\"; according to NPR, the drafter of the definition of antisemitism used by the Trump administration believes his definition \"is being distorted and used to silence anti-Israel critics.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that Jewish groups are split on whether opposing Israel is antisemitic. For example, the Anti-Defamation League, known for its pro-Israel advocacy, considers some criticisms of Israel, including anti-Zionism (opposition to the existence of Israel), antisemitic. In contrast, Jewish Voice for Peace, an anti-Zionist Jewish organization, says, \"there has been debate, criticism and opposition to Zionism within Jewish thought for as long as it has existed\" and \"criticism of Zionism is not to be conflated with antisemitism.\""}

One could argue it was the electric garage door opener. The first such openers with a radio-based remote controls came to market way back in 1931, predating the first TV remote by 20 years. Comfort and convenience were the motivation behind all three technological advances. In the case of the garage door, people were looking for a way to get out of their cars and into their homes while avoiding the weather. Given that history, it’s a wonder that it took so long to bring IoT technology to the biggest door in the house.\n\nWell, the good news is that it’s here now. And the better news is that most existing garage door openers can be integrated with the rest of your smart home, greatly reducing the cost of that convenience. What’s more, these products are rapidly improving in both simplicity and capability. Buy one and you’ll not only be able to open and shut the door from anywhere—letting in guests, relatives, or delivery people—you’ll also know whether the door is open or closed in real time.\n\nWhy you should trust us\n\nTechHive’s writers and editors have been reviewing smart home products for decades, and they draw on their deep and wide experience to evaluate every new product that comes to market. We install the products we review in our own homes to gain real-world experience as we evaluate how well they can be integrated into existing systems as well as how they perform on their own.\n\nThe best smart garage door opener controllers\n\nBest smart garage door controller – Chamberlain myQ Smart Garage Hub (model MYQ-G0401) Pros Price remains unbeatable\n\nAttractive styling fits in with the typical garage décor\n\nPlenty of third-party compatibility Cons Occasional trouble with disconnects\n\nStill no support for a third garage door (you must buy a second controller) It’s still a no-brainer: Everything we said about the Chamberlain model MYQ-G0301 myQ Smart Garage Door Hub is now true of the Chamberlain model MYQ-G0401: It’s the easiest smart garage door controller to set up, the most functional controller on the market, and, it’s the least expensive on the market—by a wide margin. That said, there’s little reason to upgrade from the previous model. The myQ app is simple to configure and use, and the system supports a small but growing number of smart home ecosystems, including HomeKit. While it isn’t compatible with every opener—check online before you buy—it’s definitively the one to get.

They’re all inexpensive, but value is defined by more than a price tag. The Meross Smart Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener is on the better end of that scale. If Chamberlain’s product doesn’t fit your needs, this one is worth your consideration. (Note: This device is not HomeKit compatible, but Meross offers a separate model that is.

You don’t need to have a myQ smart garage door controller installed (and the myQ camera doesn’t interact with the myQ controller at all); but if you do, your camera feed will appear directly above your garage door controls within the app. It’s a handy way to get one-stop access to everything that’s going on in the least inviting room of your house. Its magnetic base makes it easy to mount on the bottom of any garage door opener with a metal enclosure. The camera also works with the Key by Amazon system and app, which in this case would empower Amazon delivery drivers to open your garage and place your Amazon packages securely inside. Read our full LiftMaster myQ Smart Garage Camera review\n\nHow to pick the right smart garage door controller\n\nWhile garage door openers come in a vast range of brands, styles, and capabilities, the good news is that you’ll likely be able to find a smart controller that works with your system without much trouble.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the Chamberlain myQ is my top pick for a variety of reasons, but because it exclusively relies on wireless technology, it isn’t compatible with every system on the market. To start, visit myQ’s compatibility tool and check whether your existing opener is supported. If it is, and you don’t care that it’s not compatible with Alexa or Samsung SmartThings, your work is done: Get the myQ. If it isn’t, you can either get an all-new opener as Chamberlain suggests (although that won’t resolve the Alexa and SmartThings issues), or delve into the world of wired smart garage door controllers.\n\nThe Nexx NXG-200 must be attached to your garage door opener via wires, and space can be tight depending on your ceiling height.\n\nActually, upgrading your old, incompatible door opener is not a terrible idea, and new models are more secure and less expensive than you might think. Considering that a wired garage door controller can run you about $100, it’s worth thinking hard about whether you want to pour more money into an outdated system that might be close to failure, or just upgrade it from the start. (Many new openers have smart technology built in, obviating the need for an add-on controller.)\n\nBut if you do have an opener that’s incompatible with our top pick, and you want to keep it around, you’ll need a wired controller like the Nexx Garage NXG-200 (be sure to read our April 5 story about a security vulnerability associated with Nexx garage door controllers) or the Garadget Wired controllers. These must be connected to the opener via a pair of wires, so you’ll need to be comfortable with some minor electrical work in order to install them. Like myQ, Nexx offers an online compatibility tool, but here you’re likely to find that Nexx is either compatible straight out of the box, or compatible only with an additional adapter. In other words, wired controllers are generally compatible with everything, or, at least, I haven’t found any openers yet that aren’t compatible with them.\n\nThe Garadget fires a laser once a second at the door to determine whether it is open or closed.As with the product from NEXX, the Garadget must be hardwired to your opener.\n\nThe catch involves the adapter. Generally speaking, if you have an older garage door opener, Nexx and Garadget will work with it straight out of the box. If you have a newer opener, you’ll need their adapter as well. This is because newer openers often have a more complex encryption system built in, and a standard push-button remote—which is what wired smart controllers emulate—won’t work with them. The solution is to place a button that is compatible with this encryption in between the controller and the opener: The controller tells the button to activate, which in turn tells the opener to open or close. It’s a little wonky, but in my testing, these setups work just as well as the wireless alternative.\n\nThe problem is that it’s just a lot more expensive to do it this way. Purchasing a Nexx and an adapter will run you $105 at press time, and a Garadget plus adapter costs $98. Compare that to the less than $40 you’ll spend on the myQ and there’s really no choice.\n\nAgain, if myQ isn’t compatible, either Nexx or Garadget will make for an acceptable alternative, provided you’re willing to spend a little extra to get the job done. We’ll review new products in this space as they come to market and will update our top pick as warranted."}

This week, it was Liverpool midfielder Ryan Gravenberch at the centre of attention following comments made by his agent, José Fortes Rodriguez. But according to Lewis Steele of the Daily Mail, the reaction may have been overblown.\n\nSpeaking on the Media Matters podcast hosted by Dave Davis for Anfield Index, Steele was clear that the context behind the interview had been “slightly misqued”.\n\nAgent Profile Piece, Not a Transfer Hint\n\n“There’s been a lot of reaction to this,” said Steele, referring to the comments made by Rodriguez. “The interview is probably quite important in its context. José was doing an interview about himself — it was a piece about him, not about Gravenberch.”\n\nRodriguez, who also represents other Dutch talents such as Micky van de Ven and Brian Brobbey, briefly mentioned Real Madrid’s previous interest in Gravenberch during the profile. But according to Steele, this wasn’t meant to suggest any current negotiations or intent.\n\n“Real Madrid were interested in the past,” he clarified, “but it’s not to say they’re still interested now.”\n\nNo Indications Gravenberch Wants to Leave Liverpool\n\nDespite the noise generated on social media, Steele was unequivocal about Gravenberch’s current mindset: “From people I speak to, he’s loving life at Liverpool — and that’s not going to change anytime soon.”\n\nThe message was clear: this was not a case of a player angling for a move or even seriously weighing up his options. Instead, it was a routine comment from an agent, misinterpreted in the ongoing swirl of transfer discourse.\n\n“It’s just an agent being honest,” Steele said. “I do think it’s a bit of a storm in a teacup.”\n\nSocial Media Reaction Overshadows Reality\n\nThe quote from Gravenberch’s agent, while intriguing, seems to have taken on a life of its own, driven by the usual speculation that comes with Real Madrid’s name being mentioned.\n\nSteele said the media frenzy around the comment did not match its significance: “I think what he was trying to say has probably been lost in translation slightly… it’s been slightly misqued.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time agents’ remarks have been interpreted as a transfer pitch, especially in April, when the summer window looms large and clubs begin to plan. But in this case, Steele’s verdict was simple and reassuring to Liverpool supporters: “There’s no suggestion that Gravenberch wants out.”\n\nAnfield Remains Home for Now\n\nAt 21, Ryan Gravenberch is still settling into life at Anfield. After joining from Bayern Munich last summer, he’s shown glimpses of the dynamic presence that made him such a coveted prospect in the Netherlands.\n\nLewis Steele’s comments reaffirm what many close to the club have already indicated: Liverpool’s midfield rebuild includes Gravenberch, and there are no internal signs pointing towards an early exit. The Dutch midfielder is part of the plan under Arne Slot, and his agent’s remarks, while headline-grabbing, are just part of the noise.\n\nFor now, Gravenberch remains focused on his development — and as Steele aptly concluded, “That one will quickly pass.”"}

The news broke on Friday morning via Anfield Index, where Gags Tandon and Dave Davis delivered an emotional and analytical reaction in their special podcast episode. For a fanbase fuelled by legacy and leadership, the announcement is more than a contract—it’s a statement of intent.\n\nBuzz Around Anfield\n\n“This was the big boy that needed to be at the club for next season,” said Gags Tandon emphatically. Salah’s two-year contract extension has not only stabilised the mood among supporters but also lifted an emotional weight. Tandon continued, “I think everybody can just breathe a big, big sigh of relief now.”\n\nDave Davis added to the sense of significance: “This just feels almost like we’re breaking the season up into another chunk… That atmosphere is going to be electric now, isn’t it?” With Salah now secured, the focus for fans and players alike shifts towards an invigorated push in the title race.\n\nData Doesn’t Lie\n\nSalah’s stats this season underscore why Liverpool had no choice but to renew. “Mo Salah has got 27 goals and 17 assists in the Premier League alone,” Davis pointed out. “Liverpool this season in the Premier League… have scored 72 goals. Mo Salah is more than half our goal contributions.”\n\nIn a time where every decision is scrutinised, keeping Salah became a no-brainer. “You couldn’t not renew Mo, could you? It just had to be done,” said Gags, brushing aside any notion that the Egyptian King was past his peak. The figures reinforce the point—Salah is still the standard.\n\nMore Than Just Goals\n\nThe discussion pivoted to the broader impact Salah’s extension has on the club’s trajectory. As Gags noted, “This was important not only for this season and the end of this block but important for the new generation that’s about to join us.” The likes of Virgil van Dijk and Salah represent not only continuity but also mentorship.\n\nPlayers, Gags argued, “have played as if they were dedicated to being here… wanting to prove that they could win a title again.” This isn’t just about legacy—it’s about leading Liverpool into a fresh era under Arne Slot.\n\nAnd make no mistake, the timing of the announcement was deliberate. “West Ham will probably go, ‘Oh my god, did they have to release this this weekend?’” laughed Davis, knowing full well that Sunday’s Anfield clash is now charged with even more electricity.\n\nTactical Evolution and Slot’s Influence\n\nThe panel gave due credit to new boss Arne Slot as well. “Slot deserves a hell of a lot of credit in how he’s managed him,” said Tandon. “He’s sprinting less but sprinting in the right places… We want you sprinting in the other half, we want you doing your best work there.”\n\nThis strategic adaptation could well extend Salah’s peak. “Imagine how many records he’s about to break,” Gags said, noting that Salah may soon surpass Harry Kane as the Premier League’s all-time top-scoring winger. “He’s going to go down in history as the greatest right winger in Premier League history.”\n\nConclusion\n\nLiverpool’s message with Salah’s extension is loud and clear: stability, ambition, and quality will define the next phase of their journey. As Gags aptly summed up, “We’re going to witness 10 years of Mo Salah… That’s just incredible.”\n\nAnd now, the King’s contract is more than ink on paper—it’s a symbol. A reminder to rivals and recruits alike that Liverpool is not rebuilding—they’re reloading."}

The celebrated forward, wearing the iconic No.11 shirt, has been an instrumental figure in Liverpool’s accomplishments, boasting a staggering tally of 243 goals since his arrival in 2017. This remarkable achievement places him as the third-highest scorer in the club’s illustrious history.\n\nSeason Aspirations and Team Dynamics\n\nSalah’s ambitions for the season are clear and well-grounded in the team’s current performance. With Liverpool leading the league by a substantial 11 points and only seven matches remaining, the prospect of clinching the Premier League title is highly feasible. The determination to secure another league title under the guidance of manager Arne Slot highlights the positive atmosphere and the driven nature of the squad.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with liverpoolfc.com, Salah expressed his conviction, “If I don’t believe that I would have not signed. I believe the team can win trophies.” This statement not only reflects his confidence in the team’s capabilities but also his personal commitment to the club’s future success.\n\nThe Role of Fan Support in Liverpool’s Quest for Trophies\n\nThe forward also acknowledged the significant role that the fans and the city of Liverpool play in the team’s successes. The unyielding support from the stands is a vital component of their game-day advantage, empowering the players and creating an intimidating atmosphere for any visiting team. Salah emphasised this, stating, “With the support of the fans and the city, and the support they always give us in the games, I believe we can win many trophies in the next years.”\n\nChallenges Ahead\n\nDespite the optimism, the road to the championship is not devoid of challenges. Salah himself admits, “It’s not going to be easy at all because Arsenal are also catching up.” This acknowledgment serves as a reminder that the journey towards the title will require persistence and collective effort from the entire team.\n\n“Our aim is clear, and the fans deserve it – last time we won it we didn’t celebrate it that much. Hopefully we do it this time,” Salah adds, highlighting the communal desire to share this potential victory more emphatically with the supporters.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nSalah’s renewal is a clear signal of his dedication and belief in our club’s potential. It’s exhilarating to think about what the next few years could bring with Salah at the helm of our attacking force. His record speaks for itself, but it’s his passion for the club and its supporters that truly makes him a legend in the making.\n\nThe idea of winning the Premier League again, especially after the subdued celebrations last time, fills every Liverpool fan with immense anticipation and excitement. With Salah’s drive and Slot’s tactical acumen, it feels like we’re on the brink of another golden era. Let’s rally behind our team and make Anfield a fortress of support as we head into these final games. YNWA!"}

It’s precisely the tonic the club and fanbase needed ahead of Sunday’s clash with West Ham United.\n\nThis fixture now carries more weight than just three points. The Premier League title race is entering its sharpest phase, and Liverpool must reassert themselves quickly.\n\nMomentum Needed After Recent Setbacks\n\nLiverpool’s defeat at Craven Cottage exposed vulnerabilities. It wasn’t just the scoreline — it was the sluggish tempo and lack of attacking fluency. Slot’s side, so often swashbuckling in recent months, suddenly looked short of both ideas and energy. Prior to that, scraping past Everton at Anfield required more resilience than rhythm.\n\nThe Champions League exit, too, has left scars. Not only was it a blow to the club’s continental ambitions, but it disrupted the psychological momentum that comes from European nights. Add to that the Carabao Cup final loss and questions inevitably arise: are Liverpool running out of steam?\n\nThat narrative may be premature, but the only way to kill it is with a commanding performance. With the Kop roaring and the atmosphere fuelled by the Salah and Van Dijk announcements, Slot will demand not just a result, but a statement.\n\nWest Ham’s Slide and Liverpool’s Opportunity\n\nWest Ham United arrive at Anfield without a win in four, having slowly slid out of contention for European places. Graham Potter’s side remain dangerous — particularly on the counter — but defensively, they’ve been far too open.\n\n“Generous guests” might be an unfair tag, but it’s one that reflects their current fragility. Niclas Fullkrug, who scored after coming on against Bournemouth, may start and could provide a more physical threat up front. Behind him, Jarrod Bowen, Lucas Paqueta, and Mohamed Kudus have the ability to trouble Liverpool’s high line — but it’s their back four that remains the concern.\n\nAaron Cresswell, Crysencio Summerville, and Michail Antonio remain sidelined, further depleting Moyes’ options.\n\nTeam News and Tactical Tweaks\n\nLiverpool will hope to welcome Alisson Becker back into the fold, after the Brazilian missed the Fulham defeat. Slot is unlikely to risk Trent Alexander-Arnold just yet, with Conor Bradley expected to return at right-back. Joe Gomez and Tyler Morton remain unavailable, but Curtis Jones — who oddly filled in at full-back last weekend — could return to midfield.\n\nDiogo Jota’s subdued display could open the door for Luis Diaz to return, while Darwin Nunez, ever lively but unpredictable, is in contention once again.\n\nThe key for Liverpool will be speed — both in thought and execution. Slot’s attacking structure has often been defined by rapid vertical movement, but when that stalls, the team looks unbalanced. The midfield will need to regain its bite, and Salah, now two games without a goal, will be hungry to rediscover his scoring touch in front of a packed Anfield.\n\nPrediction: Reds to Rebound with Authority\n\nAfter a week of setbacks, Sunday feels like a crossroads moment in Liverpool’s season. Slot will demand intensity from the first whistle and, with West Ham struggling for rhythm and resilience, the opportunity is there to respond emphatically.\n\nPrediction: Liverpool 3-0 West Ham United\n\nAs long as they avoid the complacency that crept in against Fulham, the Reds should control proceedings and get back on track in the Premier League title race.\n\nHead-to-Head Record\n\nLiverpool wins: 85\n\nDraws: 38\n\nWest Ham wins: 29\n\nKick-off and Broadcast Info"}

Sophie is presenting on her recently accepted first-author paper in Aging Cell on two specific genes that, when activated, extend lifespan in C. elegans roundworms, the model organism of her research.\n\n2. Sophie walks by Martin’s poster after she is done presenting her own. She is not immediately impressed by his work. It is not published, for one thing. But she sees how it is attention-grabbing and relevant, even necessary. He has a little crowd listening to him. He notices her—a frowning girl—standing in the back and begins to talk louder, hoping she hears.\n\n“Supercentenarians are much less likely to have seven diseases,” he says, pointing to his poster. “Alzheimer’s, heart failure, diabetes, depression, prostate cancer, hip fracture, and chronic kidney disease. Though they have higher instances of four diseases, which are arthritis, cataracts, osteoporosis, and glaucoma. These aren’t linked to mortality, but they do affect quality of life.”\n\nWhat stands out to Sophie is the confidence in Martin’s voice, despite the unsurprising nature of the findings. She admires that sound, its sturdiness. She makes note of his name and plans to seek him out.\n\n3. They find one another in the hotel bar among other graduate students. The students are talking about the logistics of their futures: Who is going for a postdoc, who will opt for industry, do any have job offers already, where will their research have the most impact, is it worth spending years working toward something so uncertain? They stay up too late, dissecting journal articles they’ve read as if they were debating politics. They enjoy the freedom away from their labs and PIs.\n\nMartin says, again with that confidence, that he will become a professor. Sophie says she likely won’t go down that path. She has received an offer to start as a scientist at an aging research startup called Abyssinian Bio, after she defends. Martin says, “Wouldn’t your work make more sense in an academic setting, where you have more freedom and power over what you do?” She says, “But that could be years from now and I want to start my real life, so …”\n\n4-18. Martin is enamored with Sophie. She is not only brilliant; she is helpful. She strengthens his papers with precise edits and grounds his arguments with stronger evidence. Sophie is enamored with Martin. He is not only ambitious; he is supportive and adventurous. He encourages her to try new activities and tools, both in and out of work, like learning to ride a motorcycle or using CRISPR.\n\nMartin visits Sophie in San Francisco whenever he can, which amounts to a weekend or two every other month. After two years, their long-distance relationship is taking its toll. They want more weekends, more months, more everything together. They make plans for him to get a postdoc near her, but after multiple rejections from the labs where he most wants to work, his resentment toward academia grows.\n\n“They don’t see the value of my work,” he says.\n\n19. “Join Abyssinian,” Sophie offers. The company is growing. They want more researchers with data science backgrounds. He takes the job, drawn more by their future together than by the science.\n\n20-35. For a long time, they are happy. They marry. They do their research. They travel. Sophie visits Martin’s extended family in France. Martin goes with Sophie to her cousin’s wedding in Taipei. They get a dog. The dog dies. They are both devastated but increasingly motivated to better understand the mechanisms of aging. Maybe their next dog will have the opportunity to live longer. They do not get a next dog.\n\nSophie moves up at Abyssinian. Despite being in industry, her work is published in well-respected journals. She collaborates well with her colleagues. Eventually, she is promoted to executive director of research.\n\nMartin stalls at the rank of principal scientist, and though Sophie is technically his boss—or his boss’s boss—he genuinely doesn’t mind when others call him “Dr. Sophie Xie’s husband.”"}
