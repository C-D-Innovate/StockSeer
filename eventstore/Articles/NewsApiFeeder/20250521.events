Thirteen alleged members were arrested in California and Florida on Tuesday, including Ara Artuni and his archrival, Robert Amiryan, both of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles.\nAllegations date back to at least 2021. The Department of Justice accused the Artuni Enterprise of cargo theft, by enrolling its associates as Amazon carriers who would get contracts for trucking routes \ufffd and then steal all or part of the shipment. \nThe DOJ also alleged the organization ran a \ufffdcredit card bust-out\ufffd scheme, in which \ufffdthey charged various credit cards to a sham business then drained the business account before the credit card companies could collect the to-be disputed funds.\ufffd\nThe Armenian mob is linked to the Russian mafia and is known as avtoritet, the Russian word for \ufffdauthority.\ufffd A power struggle between Artuni and Amiryan had led to multiple foiled hit jobs, including a kidnapping and torture. \nArmenian Organized Crime, a transnational syndicate, has made Los Angeles County a center of its U.S. operations. Since 2022, the two local leaders within avtoritet allegedly have engaged in a fight for control in their territory.\nThat included an attempt on Amiryan\ufffds life in 2023 after associates of Amiryan \ufffdconspired with members of his own criminal organization to kidnap and torture one of Artuni\ufffds associates in June 2023,\ufffd according to the DOJ.\n\ufffd\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."}
