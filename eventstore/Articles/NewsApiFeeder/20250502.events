Post publication of said news articles, the scrip price of the company went up by almost 15% on March 25, 2020, Sebi had said.The regulator had also said there were many other news articles that appeared in the media relating to Jio-Facebook deal prior to its corporate announcement by the company.\"... in our view, it was the responsibility of the RIL to have made prompt disclosure to make information generally available, when it was disclosed selectively in certain media by unknown sources, which had ostensibly reached to only selected universe of subscribers of such international print media and not to all investors / potential investors. Moreover, in such times of uncertainty, in the interest of protecting its shareholders, it was the duty caste upon the company to make due disclosure to clear the dust,\" said the SAT bench presided over by Justice PS Dinesh Kumar."}

Asked by the anchor John Roberts about Donald Trump’s plummeting poll numbers, Miller offered a testy reply: “I don’t want to make things awkward for you, John, but it is our opinion that Fox News needs to fire its pollster.”\n\nThe comment was classic political spin—when you don’t like the score, go after the refs. And it briefly changed the subject, media-chatter-wise, from the national news to the interpersonal tension, as headlines proliferated about Miller and his MAGA-versus-Fox moment. But Miller’s comment was not exactly news. For starters, it was one more version of the same anti-polling talking points the White House has been issuing in response to the president’s ratings. It was also simply the latest twist in one of the longest-running stories in American politics: the love-hate relationship between Fox and Trump.\n\nThat relationship, because of its historical import and turbulence, is a matter of frequent speculation among the media and the public. Questions about its status have taken on the kind of close-reading-from-a-distance that is typically reserved for celebrity couples. (Are Trump and Fox together? Are they taking a break? Have they gone Instagram-official? Is he seeing other people?) Trump might seem to be the one making the decisions. “FOX NEWS IS NOT OUR FRIEND,” he announced in the days leading up to the 2024 election. But the bond between the president and the network is thoroughly symbiotic, and as such thoroughly stable.\n\nRead: Growing up Murdoch\n\nFox is not state media. But Trump still acts, as MSNBC’s Steve Benen wrote on Wednesday, as if Fox is “a political instrument instead of a news organization.” When, in the run-up to the 100-day mark of Trump’s second term, Fox and many other outlets released polls suggesting new extremes of public dismay, Trump complained. “Rupert Murdoch has told me for years that he is going to get rid of his FoxNews, Trump Hating, Fake Pollster, but he has never done so,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “This ‘pollster’ has gotten me, and MAGA, wrong for years.” In that, the president was effectively expanding his duties from “American president” to “Fox News director.” Likewise, when Miller shared the administration’s “opinion” on air that the pollster should be fired, he was appointing himself as an HR consultant.\n\nMiller and Trump were suggesting that the president, in his relationship with the network, has the upper hand. Yet the two were obfuscating the reality. Trump may decry “FAKE POLLS FROM FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS” and assert that “these people should be investigated for ELECTION FRAUD.” He may imply that his emotions carry weight, that his anger will bring consequences. In relationships that are purely transactional, though, love and hate are nullified by mutual need.\n\nOn Tuesday, the same day that Miller used Fox’s air to criticize Fox, the CBS reporter Scott MacFarlane published a detailed accounting of the ties between the White House and the morning talk show Fox & Friends. The show, with its journalistically murky blend of news and casual banter, serves the administration’s needs in a few ways, the report suggested. It offers White House representatives a platform for friendly interviews. Its first-thing-in-the-morning timing means that its content is well situated to set the news agenda—or to relay the administration’s spin. Its high ratings mean that anyone who appears on the show can speak directly to many, many Americans.\n\nBut the show is useful in another way, MacFarlane suggested: Fox, in addition to serving as a media outlet, also serves as an in-house communications organ. Officials in Trump’s second White House, like officials in his first, use their appearances on Fox & Friends to grab the attention of the chief executive. Attorney General Pam Bondi did that on Monday. (“Good job on television this morning, Pam,” Trump said during an event in the afternoon.) “Often, there’s an audience of one,” a former government official told MacFarlane. Asked by CBS to comment on the administration’s “evolving media strategy,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, responded with a statement: “We are flattered that CBS is asking the Trump White House how to make good TV. Clearly they need the advice!”\n\nTrump may tryst with other networks, but he always comes home to Fox. He does so whether he claims to be angry with the network or not. That’s the thing about a marriage of convenience: It writes emotions out of the equation. As long as the Trump-Fox relationship retains its baseline utility for both parties, it will be, effectively, indissoluble.\n\nRead: Do you speak Fox?\n\nThis may help explain why Trump’s latest attacks on the network, for all their apparent explosivity, are nonetheless carefully calibrated. In criticizing Fox’s polling numbers, Trump has directed his ire not at Fox News as a body but merely at one of its arms: its polling operation, and more specifically, at one employee within it. His rants may hint at rupture; at their heart, though, they offer assurances of repair. Trump is positioning his anger against the broader needs of harmonious partnership: While his own numbers have been plummeting, Fox’s have been rising. As The Wrap reported this week, “Fox News just enjoyed the highest-rated first 100 days of any presidency in cable news history.”\n\nFox’s numbers, like Trump’s feelings, are fickle. The partners are faithful to each other both despite and because of that. The microdynamics might change; the broader commitment is steady. As long as Trump treats attention as currency, he will be, to some extent, in Fox’s thrall. This week, the White House released a new platform it calls the White House Wire. The website—Drudge Report in its aesthetic and propagandistic in most other ways—appears to be the administration’s latest effort to circumvent traditional media sources. But the platform thus far contains mostly social-media posts and articles aggregated from, among other sources, Fox News.\n\nThe network, ever constant, will continue to play its part as well. On Tuesday, Fox & Friends marked the 100th day of Trump’s second term with a lengthy video claiming to summarize its noteworthy events—a supercut compilation of out-of-context “accomplishments,” fast-paced and set to jazzy music, resembling what marketers call a “sizzle reel.” The package was studiously upbeat. It sold the presidency it claimed to summarize. It looked like a campaign ad. It also looked like a peace offering."}

He earned his tuition by living in a basement boiler room and keeping the boilers fired for that building. He frequently ate on 10 cents a day: a nickel for a Coke, a nickel for a can of sardines, and the soda crackers that were free with the sardines. He picked up a bit of pocket money by playing his guitar for the little mountain churches on Sundays, and playing saxophone with a local dance band on Saturday nights. 75 years later, with my Daddy long gone, we were cleaning out the house I grew up in, preparing to sell it. Among the artifacts that turned up - Daddy's saxophone. It was never a high quality instrument, and 75+ years in basement storage had not been kind to it. It didn't make sense to try to restore it, but I couldn't bear to throw it out. It came home with me and collected dust for a couple of years, until I came home from school one day to find that my brilliant husband had transformed it into this awesome lamp\n\n\n\n#12 Found This Sitting By My Neighbors Trash Can, She Thought I Had Lost My Mind Over How Excited I Was And Was More Than Happy To Let Me Dig It Out Of Her Trash.

She cut out all of the pieces but passed away before it was completed. Years after her death my grandmother decided she should complete the quilt for me. She worked on putting the small pieces together to form the large diamonds that would make up the star. At this time she realized that her mother had cut the pieces wrong and instead of being a 8 pointed star it was going to be a 7 pointed star. She became frustrated trying to figure it out and packed it back up in it's bag. Some time after that she passed the pieces to my Mom, who had limited experience and didn't attempt to work on it. Once I hit adulthood the bag was passed to me. I put the large diamonds together to form the 7 pointed star, but did not know how to complete the quilt. A few years later I got married, and my mother in law is a master quilt maker, so she took the 7 pointed star and put it on a beautiful white background and completed the quilt (she used the 8th large diamond to do the edging of the quilt. I think by the time I received the finished project I was around 40. I think that all of the hands and minds that worked together to make this beautiful piece, only make it more valuable. It fits a king size bed, which is a funny thing to make for a baby gift and has never been used on a bed (due to the color and nostalgia connected, and since I have 3 dogs) but I have had it hung up at different times over the years to enjoy. Sorry for such a long winded story, but I hope you enjoyed it. I took some of your advice and decided to use it for the first time ever, I put it on our bed and slept like a baby last night.\n\n\n\n#18 Got This Piano From A Friends Barn For Free When I Was In Middle School, It Was Built In 1920 And It Was Full Of Mice And Falling Apart Share icon It was my first antique I ever aquired and I spent 2 years restoring it.

They were removing this dino ride from the playground there and he convinced them to let him take it instead of destroying it. As my boyfriend and I were pulling up to our house, he was less enthusiastic about the new addition than I was . My parents thought it was a HYSTERICAL belated birthday present. After some back and forth about where he belongs, the agreement was that I'm *supposed* to be moving him to the back yard... (so no one can see it? or so no one can steal it? who knows!!) but currently I kind of shuffle him around for dramatic effect and majestic photo ops. PS - I've started calling him Stuart.\n\n\n\n#24 Saw This At Treasures And Junk In Ontario, California. It Was Sold Already, For 500$. What An Amazing Chair And It’s Purple & Black!

My first memory of skeleton keys was her giving me 3 keys and telling me that one was my key to college, another one was the key to the Disney castle, and the third was a key to her heart. Whenever I would get good grades we'd go to antique stores and I would get to pick out a few of my favorite. Anytime I go someplace new I try to pick one up. I have also received a few as gifts. I think they're just so neat...the stories they could tell. About 5 years ago I moved back home from living in California and was lucky enough to be able to buy my grandmother's home. A few days ago I FINALLY found a way and place to showcase the keys! I am overjoyed with how cool it looks. Now instead of them being stored away in a box, I can look at them everyday and think about my Grandma.\n\n\n\n#29 Forgot To Make The Bed Before Snapping A Pic, But I Got It From My Friend For $100 And He Told Me It Came Out Of A House In Detroit Michigan Share icon\n\n#30 My Home Is A Renovated Episcopal Church That Was Built In 1871 Share icon The 9 remaining stained glass windows are original to the structure. As it turns out, the windows are secondhand from a church from the east coast. They were saved when that church was torn down, and got repurposed when this one was built. They were created with small sections of stained glass and larger areas made with a screen printing technique.

(Now I know where I get them!) 2. The box is as fascinating as the ring. It is leather, velvet lined, and hinged with a latch hook. 3. Not sure the year they married but my grandfather was born (in wedlock) in 1908 so the ring and box are 113+ years old! 4. I looked up the jeweller and learned that Harris Leon Brown founded the store in England in 1861. In 1917, upon his death, his son succeeded him. The business has remained in the family down the line to his great, great grandson today! (The website has pandemic protocols listed for the stores.) 5.

Shri Thanedar, the Indian-born millionaire who introduced articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on Monday, considered running as an independent or even a Republican, multiple consultants told The Intercept.\n\nThanedar, who filed seven articles of impeachment against Trump on Monday, branded himself as a “fiscally savvy Bernie” Sanders during a failed gubernatorial run in 2018. But consultants told The Intercept that he was open to running as an independent or a Republican when he spoke to them before beginning his campaign.\n\n🚨 Democrat Congressman Shri Thanedar of Michigan has filed SEVEN articles of impeachment against President Trump. pic.twitter.com/OUYGf5QiLW — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) April 28, 2025\n\nMichigan Democratic consultant Adrian Hemond and Republican consultant Dan McMaster told The Intercept they had a meeting together with Thanedar.\n\n“We asked him what party he wanted to run from and he said he didn’t care,” Hemond claimed. “He said whichever side we thought he had the best chance to win on.”\n\nWhile pressing Thanedar on his positions, the consultants allegedly found him to be ambivalent at best on issues like abortion.\n\n“His position was mostly that he didn’t care. That he would adopt whatever position was beneficial for him to run for governor,” Hemond told the outlet.\n\nThanedar’s political shapeshifting was allegedly so apparent that consultants thought he was on different sides of the same issue. (RELATED: Backbench Democrat Uses Taxpayer Funds To Promote Trump Impeachment Effort)\n\n“He did admit he was pro-life, which is interesting, [now] that he is running as a progressive Democrat,” Dan McMaster, a consultant with Republicans, told The Intercept.\n\nAnother consultant, Joe DiSano, head of the consulting agency DiSano Strategies, said he concluded that the pharma entrepreneur was “adamantly pro-choice” after two meetings in January and February 2017.\n\nThanedar countered the claims that he was not settled on a pro-choice stance.\n\n“I am 100% pro-choice. Look at my factual voting record, not lies told by people upset I didn’t hire them,” he told the Daily Caller. He then provided links to his Congressional Scorecard from Planned Parenthood.\n\nDespite lauding Sanders and progressives publicly, DiSano claimed he got the impression that Thanedar was staunchly opposed to everything Bernie stood for.\n\n“My key takeaway from my experience with Shri is his disdain for ‘progressives.’ He repeatedly expressed disdain for them, and Bernie Sanders in particular,” DiSano told the outlet.\n\nThanedar disputed that notion in an interview with The Intercept.\n\n“I love Bernie, I love his ideas, and I met him, I followed him. So, I don’t know where he gets all that,” he said of DiSano’s comments.\n\nDiSano claimed he terminated his relationship with Thanedar because “he is way too slippery for me,” according to The Intercept. Thanedar claimed told the outlet he fired the consultant for overcharging him for polling data.\n\nThanedar confirmed that he met with both Hemond and DiSano and said he did not want to give away his positions at the time of the meetings, according to the outlet.\n\nThanedar caught flak from progressives for seemingly fawning over Secretary of State Marco Rubio in 2016 when Rubio, then a Republican Senator from Florida, was running to be his party’s nominee for president.\n\nA C-Span video from a Rubio campaign rally in Iowa caught Thanedar in the audience nodding and smiling along to Rubio’s comments, even clapping after Rubio said “Hillary Clinton can not be commander in chief of the United States.”\n\nHis applause came despite donating $2,300 to Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2007, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) records. He also donated $2,300 to then-Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain’s presidential campaign, though he told the Intercept that the McCain donation was an outlier as he’s donated nearly $29,000 to Democrats.\n\nHe dismissed allegations that his attendance of Rubio’s rally was tantamount to support.\n\n“In Iowa, you get such access to the politicians you would otherwise not get,” he told The Intercept. “So I went to house parties, I went to several presentations by the Clintons, I went to several rallies by Bernie. I also went to some rallies by the Republican candidates. But I’m more interested in the process.”\n\nDiSano claimed Thanedar “was particularly enamored with Rubio.”\n\nDemocrat Shri Thanedar is trying to impeach Trump and is now running this billboard in his district, which is TAXPAYER-FUNDED. pic.twitter.com/0oY1m9OMrj — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) April 29, 2025\n\n\n\nThanedar ultimately lost the 2018 Democratic primary for the governor’s race, finishing third behind current governor Gretchen Whitmer and former public health professor Abdul el-Sayed.\n\nHe ran for Congress in Michigan’s 13th district in 2022 and won, and then secured reelection in 2024.

We break it down", "fullContent": "While it once scoffed at the possibility of offering an ad-supported tier, Netflix has since embraced the idea, with millions of users snapping up its “Standard with Ads” plan, garnering plenty of interest from Madison Avenue along the way.\n\nSince its arrival more than two years ago, Netflix has added a variety of features to its ad-supported tier to set it apart from the streaming crowd–and for now, its price remains a fraction of Netflix’s priciest 4K streaming plan.\n\nSo, how much does Netflix with ads cost, what’s included, and is anything left out? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nHow much does Netflix with ads cost?\n\nNetflix Standard with Ads costs $7.99 a month, which reflects a buck-a-month price hike that Netflix imposed back in January 2025.\n\nFor some context, ad-supported Hulu costs $9.99/month, as does Disney+ Basic, while Paramount+ Essential and Peacock Premium (which, confusingly, is ad-supported) both cost $7.99 a month.\n\nFinally, Max Basic with Ads goes for $9.99 a month.\n\nAs it stands, Netflix’s cheapest available ad-free tier (following the demise of Netflix’s Basic plan) is the Standard plan, which currently costs $17.99 a month.\n\nHow many streams do you get with the Netflix Standard with Ads plan?\n\nAt launch, Netflix’s ad-supported plan (which was initially called “Basic with Ads”) only offered a single stream.\n\nBut last year, Netflix upped the number of concurrent streams available on the Standard with Ads plan to two.\n\nDoes Netflix with ads offer 4K HDR video resolution?\n\nNo, but the video quality of Netflix Standard with Ads has improved since the tier was first launched.\n\nWhile ad-supported Netflix once offered only 720p video quality, it has since been boosted to 1080p, same as Netflix’s ad-free Standard plan.\n\nCurrently, only Netflix’s priciest plan–Premium ($24.99 a month)–offers 4K HDR streaming, with four concurrent streams per household.\n\nSame as Netflix, most other streamers reserve their 4K HDR streams for their ad-free subscribers, although that’s not a universal policy; Paramount+, for one, does allow ad-supported subscribers to stream in 4K.\n\nDoes ad-supported Netflix offer downloads for offline viewing?\n\nOne of the best perks offered by the big streamers is the ability to download videos for offline viewing, perfect for binge-watching your favorite series during a long flight or when you don’t want to bust through your ISP’s (or carrier’s) data cap.\n\nUntil recently, Netflix didn’t allow its with-ads subscribers to download videos for offline viewing, a restriction shared by the other big streamers.\n\nBut in November 2023, Netflix reversed course, becoming the first big streaming service to enable offline downloads for subscribers to its ad-supported tier.\n\nThere is a monthly limit to downloads for Standard with Ads subscribers, however: 15 downloads per device, resetting on the first of the month.\n\nHow many commercial breaks does Netflix with ads have?\n\nNetflix Standard with Ads subscribers will have to sit through 4- to 5 minutes of commercials per hour, with the ads running at the beginning and during videos (ideally during “natural plot breaks”). Each ad will be either 15 or 30 seconds.\n\nThat 4- to 5-minute-per-hour figure is pretty much in line with Netflix’s competitors. For example, the “with ads” version of Max averages about four minutes an hour, while Peacock tops out at about five minutes per hour.\n\nYou will get some ad-free episodes as a bonus for binge-watching, however. Netflix previously announced a new “binge” ad unit that allows advertisers to sponsor an ad-free episode for viewers who just binge-watched a few episodes in a row. Of course, you’ll need to watch a 30- to 60-second “cinematic” ad from the sponsor before you get to watch your ad-free episode.\n\nIs Netflix with ads available on all streaming devices?\n\nMost devices that work with ad-free Netflix should also support Netflix Standard with Ads, although a “small percentage” of streaming players and TVs won’t work because its Netflix software can’t be updated anymore.\n\nAnd while the ad-supported Netflix plan wasn’t initially supported on Apple TV streaming devices, it is now (on Apple TV HD devices and later) following an update of the Netflix tvOS app in March 2023.\n\nNetflix with ads is also available on most other streaming platforms, including Amazon’s Fire TV, Android and iOS devices, most smart TVs, Mac and Windows computers, and Google TV players.\n\nDoes Netflix with ads offer the same content as ad-free Netflix?\n\nAlmost, but not quite everything. While the “vast majority” of TV shows and movies on Netflix are available for “with ads” viewers, a “small number” are missing because of “licensing issues,” Netflix says.\n\nIf you do run across a video that’s unavailable on the Netflix Standard with Ads plan, you’ll see a padlock on the title, or a “Change plan to watch” banner in place of the standard “Play” button.\n\nWhy did Netflix launch an ad-supported plan?\n\nNetflix lost subscribers during the first and second quarters of 2022, ending a decade of growth and sending Netflix’s stock price into a tailspin. And while Netflix is ubiquitous in North America, it’s having trouble gaining traction in the rest of the world, where it’s facing tough competition from cheaper streaming services.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix’s rapidly growing competitors, including Max, Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock, and Hulu, have rolled their own cheaper ad-supported plans, all of which undercut Netflix’s cheapest ad-free plans.\n\nSo while it wasn’t all that long ago that Netflix executives scoffed at the idea of cheaper ad-supported plans, the company abruptly changed course when it became clear that its once seemingly unstoppable growth had stalled.\n\nIn May 2024, Netflix reported that its Standard with Ads tier had roughly 40 million global active monthly users, up from just 5 million users in May 2023. (Netflix has since ceased tallying its monthly user base for the public.)"}

Rockstar reveals Grand Theft Auto VI release date", "fullContent": "It’s been a long wait, but developer Rockstar Games has finally announced the release date of Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI) in an official blog post. According to the announcement, the eagerly awaited game won’t be released until May 26th, 2026:\n\n“Hi everyone, Grand Theft Auto VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026. We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game. With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve. We look forward to sharing more information with you soon. Sincerely,\n\nRockstar Games”\n\nFans of the immensely popular franchise now have a date to mark in red on their calendars—but that’s the only positive aspect of this news.\n\nThe GTA community actually had their fingers crossed for an earlier release. Rockstar’s initial press release had slated the game’s release for 2025, and the CEO of Take-Two (owner of Rockstar Games) reported earlier this year that GTA VI would release in “fall of calendar 2025.” On the other hand, rumors have been circulating since fall 2024 that development of Grand Theft Auto VI would be delayed and that the game wouldn’t actually launch until mid-2026.\n\nThis means GTA fans will have to wait another six months before they can play the highly anticipated title. GTA VI will initially only be released for the Sony PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X/S. However, a PC version is expected to come at a later date.\n\nShares of Take-Two fell significantly in value—by about 10 percent—immediately after the 2026 release date was announced. No surprise there given that the revenue GTA VI was expected to bring in has now been postponed to the next fiscal year."}

If you want a slightly more powerful combo—we recommend at least 16GB of RAM when dealing with Windows 11—then you should consider paying a few bucks more for the Nitro V with Core i7 and 16GB RAM that’s on sale for $700.\n\nThe 15.6-inch IPS display is color accurate and gaming-ready with its 144Hz refresh rate and 1920×1080 resolution. You can hook up to two monitors to this laptop as it features HDMI 2.1 and Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port with 65 watts of power delivery.

After years of delay tactics and stonewalling (and, the judge says, “outright lies” in court), Apple has to allow app developers to offer in-app purchases through stores outside the App Store, here in the U.S. Apple will appeal the decision, but is required to comply with it in the meantime.\n\nIt’s not the sweeping rules instituted by the European Union, which found the platform to be a “gatekeeper” and therefore has to allow third-party app stores, app sideloading, alternate tap-and-pay processors, and so on. Those regulations, which Apple fought against tooth and nail (and has been found to be partially violating even now), have resulted in a version of iOS that many feel is better than the one we have in the U.S.\n\nThese aren’t isolated instances. Apple has consistently fought every possible effort to allow users to get apps on iPhone or iPad, or to pay for them, using anything other than Apple’s own store and payment processing. Apple tells us the main reason is security and simplicity, but it also happens to take a big cut off the top (30 percent, but Apple has been backed into various programs and policies to lower that somewhat for some developers). As a result, Apple is currently being sued by the federal government over antitrust violations.\n\nOut of control over control\n\nBack in the 80s, Apple started as a scrappy upstart, emphasizing lower costs and more freedom for users and developers, in stark contrast to IBM, which wanted to control and limit you. Now Apple seems to view itself as a holistic ecosystem, a growing network of devices and services made by and for the benefit of Apple. To the extent that it allows other developers access to “their” platform, it is being magnanimous to do so. Access to the iPhone is a gift from Apple…or at least, that’s the attitude it seems to convey.\n\nApple uses more persuasive language than that, of course. It talks about how much it “invests” in developer tools and the App Store and how the fees developers are forced to pay are a necessary cost.\n\nThe fact is, Apple isn’t a tiny company going up against the big IBMs and Microsofts of the world anymore. It’s one of the world’s most valuable companies and the most influential in tech. It has several billion customers. Apple now is the IBM of the 80s, the Microsoft of the ’90s… and it doesn’t seem to recognize it.\n\nConsider all the ways Apple still prevents anyone else from making a smartwatch that can do what the Apple Watch does on the iPhone. Apple gives its own watch special privileges, and even its own apps and services on the watch are exclusive. Earlier this year, the original creator of the Pebble smartwatch announced a new modernized version and highlighted all the ways Apple prevents any other smartwatch from working as well with the iPhone as the Apple Watch. It’s not a short list.\n\nThe new Pebble watch won’t play nice with the iPhone because of Apple’s restrictions. Pebble\n\nMost of Apple’s problems could be avoided if it weren’t so greedy about owning and controlling all access to the iPhone and iPad for every developer. Apple sees app distribution as a critical revenue source, on top of its industry-leading margins on hardware. Instead, it should view app development and distribution as a cost center. It should be a money-losing endeavor, like advertising, because it builds demand for Apple’s products.\n\nApple’s claim for its obsession with controlling all app distribution and payment always comes down to security and privacy, but that rings hollow when the company will gladly sell you a Mac—an open platform that allows direct web download of apps, alternate app stores like Steam, and open payments. And yet Mac users are not suffering some existential privacy or security risk, and for that matter, neither are Android users (which far outnumber iPhone users, globally).\n\nWhat’s more, the EU’s forcing of relaxed rules over app distribution, payments, browsers, and default apps has not resulted in headline after headline of EU iPhone users being hacked, swindled, and cyber-stalked. It’s just fine. It’s all fine. We could all have it this way, globally, and all it would do is cause a nominal drop in Apple’s revenue—again, this is the most valuable company in the world that just made a profit of more than $27B per quarter off mostly hardware sales and services.\n\nThere are two ways to make the best product or service, whether it’s earbuds, apps, app stores, or whatever else: One is to provide a better experience at a better price so customers choose you, the other is to prevent others from being able to produce an experience or price that can beat yours. Apple does both, but seems to favor the latter as much as the former.\n\nDoes Apple know what people want anymore?\n\nI’m starting to think that Apple leadership doesn’t know what people want anymore. Too many hardware lines are stuck in an endless cycle of “the same as last year but just a little better.” The big iPhone push this year is going to be a super-thin model (call it “iPhone 17 Air” if you will), which of course will limit space for advanced cameras and bigger batteries. When you ask people what they want out of an iPhone, nearly everyone says a cheaper price, longer battery life, and a better camera (with less photo processing). That’s basically the opposite of where Apple is headed.\n\nHow did Apple Intelligence end up so bad? Which leaders within Apple said, “Yeah, this is great, people will love this. Let’s build our entire marketing campaign around it?” How is Siri only now getting the attention it needs, when it has been a public joke for years? Why does Apple keep trying to court gamers to the Mac when it so very clearly doesn’t understand what gamers want or need, and isn’t willing to invest in delivering it? Why can’t Apple make a decent mouse? Why are there six different iPads? Why is the company making devices to wear on your head (Vision Pro and AirPods Max) that weigh twice what they should? Didn’t anyone try these things out? Is it just an absolute obsession with making everything out of metal?\n\nApple made Vision Pro with little regard for the user’s comfort. David Price / Foundry\n\nI mean, look at this new Snapshot website Apple just launched a few days ago. Who is this for? Why is it so bad? You can’t search it, you can’t control the scrolling, you can’t find any actual interesting info about any of these celebrities… why does this even exist and why does it have it’s own subdomain on apple.com?\n\nI want to be able to download apps and app stores on my iPhone like I do on my Mac. I want to be able to pay for things using Apple’s payment methods if I choose, or some other method if I prefer. I want developers who use Apple’s payment processing to pay fees of around 5 percent, comparable to Stripe or Square (around 3-4 percent), plus a percent or two to pay for Apple’s upkeep of the App Store. That would excite developers about making iPhone/iPad their first choice, like it used to be back in the early years of iPhone. I want hardware makers to be able to make devices that do all the things Apple’s own devices do, from quick-pairing and instant switching to sending iMessages, so that they can compete on quality, price, and innovative new capabilities.\n\nI would benefit from all these things. You would benefit from all these things. App developers and hardware makers of all kinds would benefit from these things. Apple is surely aware of all these concepts…none of this is new or novel, much of it exists on the Mac and competing platforms. But Apple would make nominally less money, and it’s starting to feel like that’s all Apple really cares about these days.\n\nApple needs to change its corporate culture from the top down. There’s a pervasive vibe that “we know what’s best, you’re lucky to be here,” and it needs to start taking a more customer-first, user-centric approach. It feels like the company acts as though we (the users and developers) need them, when it should act as though it needs us."}

Back in 2021, they introduced passwordless sign-ins for Microsoft accounts, and earlier this year, they streamlined the Microsoft account sign-in experience with an emphasis on passwordless security via so-called passkeys.\n\nHonestly, it’s a good move. Most passwords are absolutely terrible and offer little defense against hackers. A passkey, on the other hand, is an auto-generated credential that can’t be intercepted or stolen, and you don’t have to memorize anything to use it. It’s quick, easy, and secure, which is why we prefer passkeys over passwords.\n\nStarting May 1st, 2025, anyone who creates a new Microsoft account will default to a login method that doesn’t use passwords. Microsoft made this announcement yesterday for “World Passkey Day,” making it clear that they want to replace passwords with passkeys sooner rather than later. In the blog post, Microsoft writes:\n\n“New accounts are passwordless by default: As part of this simplified UX, we’re changing the default behavior for new accounts. Brand new Microsoft accounts will now be “passwordless by default.” New users will have several passwordless options for signing into their account and they’ll never need to enroll a password. Existing users can visit their account settings to delete their password.”\n\nExisting users can continue to use passwords with their Microsoft accounts, although Microsoft repeatedly points to passkeys as a more secure alternative. They even optimized the login screen for passkeys! But the company won’t force users to switch to passkeys… yet. In the same post, Microsoft also writes:\n\n“Passwordless-preferred sign-in: We’re also making it simpler to sign in with safer options. Instead of showing you all the possible ways for you to sign in, we automatically detect the best available method on your account and set that as the default. For example, if you have a password and “one time code” set up on your account, we’ll prompt you to sign in with your one time code instead of your password. After you’re signed in, you’ll be prompted to enroll a passkey. Then the next time you sign in, you’ll be prompted to sign in with your passkey. This simplified experience gets you signed in faster and in our experiments has reduced password use by over 20%. As more people enroll passkeys, the number of password authentications will continue to decline until we can eventually remove password support altogether.”\n\nIn other words, Microsoft will continue to nudge users towards passkeys with the eventual goal of doing away with passwords.\n\nIf you’re confused or skeptical or hesitant about passkeys, we don’t blame you. But really, it’s easier and more convenient than you think—and once you create your first passkey, we’re confident you’ll agree. Check out our article on easy ways to start using passkeys right now."}

They rely on pressure-sensitive layers (rubber domes) to register inputs. This construction results in a spongy typing feel that is neither precise nor pleasant.\n\nTypists usually notice that the touch feels inconsistent as soon as the rubber membranes lose their elasticity. Frequently used keys also become softer and react less reliably. What’s more, many of these keyboards are made of cheap plastic, which gives way under heavy use and makes typing even more unsatisfactory.\n\nMembrane keyboards are cheap to buy but wear out quickly. Mechanical versions—here from Cherry, for example—last longer and offer a better typing experience. However, they also cost more. Cherry\n\nThe disadvantages are particularly serious for gamers. In the worst scenario, a single misplaced command can significantly impact the outcome of a game. For this reason, many PC gamers have long since abandoned membrane keyboards in favor of mechanical models.\n\nHowever, the short lifespan of membrane keyboards is not only annoying but also ecologically problematic. An average of five to ten million keystrokes signals the end of the keyboard’s lifespan, often indicating a period of less than ten years of intensive use.\n\nMechanical keyboards, on the other hand, can withstand up to one hundred million keystrokes and also remain consistent in use. While membrane keyboards eventually end up as electronic waste, mechanical models offer a more sustainable alternative thanks to their replaceable switches (depending on the model) and durable materials.\n\nMechanical keyboards have a clear advantage: each key has a separate switch that responds precisely and evenly. Different switch types allow you to customize the typing feel and volume according to your preferences. Whether quiet, tactile, or with a noticeable click, the choice is huge.\n\nThey’re also incredibly robust. Many mechanical keyboard models last for decades and can be repaired if necessary. Hot-swappable keyboards even allow defective switches to be easily replaced without having to replace the entire keyboard.\n\nThey used to be expensive and exclusive, too. Today, thanks to increasing demand, models are available for as little as $44.99. Even these entry-level devices are superior to most membrane keyboards. They’re also suitable solutions for special requirements such as flat keys or quiet keystrokes.\n\nThe membrane keyboard (from Roccat) lacks durability due to its small rubber domes. The keystroke quickly feels spongy. Roccat\n\nA good keyboard makes typing more comfortable and contributes to sustainability. Mechanical keyboards offer a longer lifespan, a better typing experience, and significantly reduced electronic waste. Whether you type a lot, play a lot, or simply value quality, switching to a mechanical keyboard is an investment worth making."}

Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nIn late April, Meta released an update for its unbelievably popular Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses ($329 at Amazon). Although these don’t run on the exciting new Android XR platform, they have been a very successful entry into the burgeoning AR glasses market. Thanks to this latest update, the glasses now have a new feature: live translation.\n\nAs a frequent traveler, I rely on translation apps a lot — specifically Google Translate. Could the Ray-Ban Metas be better than Google Translate for my conversations with people who don’t speak English? They certainly seemed like they could, considering the convenience of having the glasses on my face, making for an unobtrusive translation conduit.\n\nObviously, you’ve already guessed this experiment’s outcome based on this article’s headline. However, continue on to see just how poorly this went.\n\nWhich translation service do you prefer? 168 votes Google Translate 73 % Apple's Translate app 7 % Meta's live translation 14 % Something else (post in comments) 6 %\n\nSetting up live translation on Ray-Ban Meta glasses\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nOnce you have the latest update installed on your glasses, the Meta AI app (formerly known as Meta View) will alert you that your Ray-Bans now support live translation. You’ll then be guided through the setup process, the first step of which is to tell Meta AI which language you speak (English, in my case).\n\nSetting up live translation on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses is easy, but you currently have a very limited selection of languages.\n\nThe next step is to tell the app which language(s) you want to translate. As of right now, Meta only offers a minimal selection of non-English languages: French, Spanish, and Italian. Hopefully, this list will expand over time, but for now, that’s all you get. For this experiment, I chose French as the translation language.\n\nOnce you’ve completed those steps, the app will download your selected language packs to your phone. This allows you to use the service even when you are away from cellular data. The packs must be pretty small, as the French download only took a few seconds on Wi-Fi.\n\nThat’s all it takes to get set up with live translation on the Ray-Ban Meta glasses. But how does it actually work? Well, that’s where things went downhill fast.\n\nUsing Ray-Ban’s live translation is, well, not good\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nIt didn’t take long for things to go awry after getting all this set up. The in-app instructions explain that there are two ways to start a translation session. The first is to hit the new Translate button on the Devices page, right underneath the picture of your glasses. The second is to wear your glasses and say, “Hey Meta,” wait for the tone, and then say “Start live translation.”\n\nI couldn't trigger a translation session using voice commands, and the translator doesn't seem to understand human laughter is not language.\n\nUnfortunately, no matter how many times I (and my partner) tried to trigger a translation session through a voice command, it never worked. The Meta AI voice would always respond with, “I can’t help with that kind of request.” So, right from the get-go, we were off to a bad start.\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThankfully, using the in-app button worked just fine for starting a session. Once I was in, I had my partner speak French while I spoke English with the glasses on. My partner’s French is a little rusty, but the app started out doing a good job of figuring out what she was trying to say.\n\nEssentially, I spoke English, and the Meta AI app instantly translated it to French. My partner could then see the French translation on my phone screen. When she responded verbally in French, I could both see the English translation on my phone and hear the translation spoken to me by Meta AI from the Ray-Bans. This was pretty fast, too — not real-time fast, but fast enough for a comfortable conversation.\n\nEventually, though, she said something wildly inaccurate and laughed at her poor pronunciation. For some reason, her laughter sent the translator into a tizzy. Check out the screenshot below:\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThis was not an ideal outcome. The translator’s understanding of our words worked OK, but a human conversation is not always just words. The fact that the AI doesn’t know what to do when someone starts laughing makes this a service I wouldn’t want to use in a legitimate conversation with a stranger while I’m traveling.\n\nGoogle Translate is still the undisputed king\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nI want to give Meta credit where credit is due: the live translation aspect of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses is, fundamentally, OK. I couldn’t trigger it with a voice command, but triggering it with the in-app button worked OK, and translating from French to English happened quickly and accurately. However, going out of control when someone starts laughing is not ideal.\n\nThe limited language support is also not great. I go to Berlin every year for IFA, so not having access to German is a deal-breaker for me.\n\nReally, the Ray-Ban Metas are just superfluous hardware. There's nothing these do that Google Translate on a phone doesn't do better.\n\nBut really, the big problem here is that there’s nothing about this that’s any better than Google Translate. That app has more reliable and accurate translations. It supports 249 languages as of today, which puts Meta’s pitiful three non-English language options to shame. It also supports broadcasting audio translations from the phone so everyone can hear, or pushing the audio directly to earbuds, replicating the novelty of the smart glasses speaking the translation for me.\n\nIf Meta’s smart glasses had display capabilities, things would be different. If I could communicate with someone while holding my phone out in front of me and not needing to turn it around to read it for myself, and instead see the translation in my glasses, that would be an interesting proposition. But Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have no display capabilities, so that’s never happening. Really, all this system does is add an extra piece of hardware to a system that is already better using Google Translate on a phone.\n\nThis whole experiment has made me excited for Samsung’s Project Moohan and other Android XR-based systems coming this year, though. A pair of smart glasses with a display that automatically translates signage and speaks translations into my ear would be pretty cool. But we’d need a brand new version of Ray-Ban Meta glasses before that would happen in the Meta ecosystem. Until then, I’ll continue to rely on Google Translate for these situations."}

They'd navigated a lean stretch from 2015-17 that saw them rattle off three consecutive last-place finishes in the AL West and come out on the other side with a swiftly acquired/developed core. Matt Olson, Matt Chapman and Sean Murphy were top-100 draft picks. Sean Manaea, Chris Bassitt and Frankie Montas were key pieces in the returns received for Ben Zobrist, Jeff Samardzija and Josh Reddick/Rich Hill, respectively. Mark Canha was added via the Rule 5 Draft (technically in a trade with the Rockies). Ramon Laureano was acquired from the division-rival Astros for a song.\n\nThe staying power of that core, as is ever the case with the low-budget A's, was finite. In early September 2021 -- much to the chagrin of some A's fans; my apologies -- MLBTR looked ahead to the massive slate of arbitration salaries facing the then-Oakland club and wondered whether another broad-reaching teardown was nigh, given the escalating cost of that core.\n\nThat rebuild indeed came to pass. Over the next calendar year, each of Olson, Chapman, Manaea, Bassitt, Montas and Lou Trivino were traded for prospects. The following offseason, Murphy, A.J. Puk and Cole Irvin followed. Canha, just like Marcus Semien and Liam Hendriks a year prior, departed for no compensation. Sam Moll went at the 2023 trade deadline.\n\nThe plus side seemed to be a bevy of new prospects who could potentially accelerate the rebuild process and help get a contending group back on the field sooner than later. If you'd told A's fans on Opening Day 2022, after that miserable offseason rebuild, that the 2025 club would be an on-the-rise team with an exciting core of hitters, they'd likely have begrudgingly accepted that another rebuild paid dividends.\n\nExcept ... that's not really the case. It's true that the A's are winning in 2025 and look more exciting than they have in four years -- but they've reached this point not because of that rebuild but rather in spite of it. Let's take a look back at the rebuild, the missteps along the way, and the manner in which this nucleus came together despite a series of whiffs on the trade market."}

A 2014 university investigation into his lab’s publications found manipulation and rotation of images that “‘show a disturbing pattern’ indicative that Rao acted intentionally or recklessly,” we previously reported. Rao sued the university for wrongful termination but lost.\n\nMore than 100 of Rao’s papers have comments on PubPeer, most originating from a user called Lotus azoricus. We now know that pseudonym belongs to sleuth Elisabeth Bik.\n\n“I had learned from several Retraction Watch articles that Dr. Rao had previously sued the University of Illinois. It seemed wise to file my complaints anonymously at the time, to avoid being sued by him as well,” Bik told us. “I have a couple more years of experience, so I now feel confident on stating publicly that the PubPeer comments by Lotus azoricus were mine.”\n\nBik had reported the Oncogene papers to the journal in 2019. In February 2024, Bik sought an update and Springer Nature told her the investigation was still ongoing.\n\nA spokesperson for Springer Nature acknowledged that Bik was the first to alert the journal to concerns with the Oncogene papers. Tim Kersjes, head of research integrity, resolutions at Springer Nature, said in a statement:\n\nWhilst we endeavour to complete our investigations as swiftly and efficiently as possible, we do so with care to ensure the integrity of the scientific record. However, we appreciate that substantial delays to investigations can be frustrating, and we apologise for the length of time taken in these cases. We take our responsibility to maintain the scientific record extremely seriously and the retraction of these papers demonstrates our commitment to this.\n\nIn a followup statement, a spokesperson added:\n\n[W]e apologise for the length of time taken in these cases. This was in part owing to the age of the articles and the difficulty we had in trying to contact the authors, as stated in the text of the retraction notices.\n\nRao was once a highly regarded cancer specialist, earning a salary of $700,000 a year. When the university kicked off its investigation in 2013, it focused on concerns about misconduct related to plagiarism and data manipulations — and on allegations of ethics violations related to allegations of kickbacks and fiscal improprieties. Rao had run up tens of thousands of dollars in gambling debts, much of it accrued on university time. Court documents from 2017 alleged that Rao had:\n\ndemanded and accepted cash payments from at least one subordinate to pay off alleged gambling debts and concealed the extent of errors in papers published by his lab and then directed subordinates to delete documents evidencing the scope of the errors.\n\nWith Rao’s publications, the easily identifiable problems include image duplications and “problems suggestive of photoshopping,” Bik said. But “ it is the sheer number of problematic papers that stand out,” she said. A PubMed search for Rao’s name calls up about 450 papers, and Bik has found issues in over 100 of them. “That means that over one in 5 of his papers have clearly visible problems,” she said. “That is a very high and concerning ratio.”\n\nBik reported 104 of Rao’s papers to the university in 2019. An official at the University of Illinois College of Medicine told her in 2022 that they were still looking into them. We’ve reached out to the university to ask whether it is still investigating Rao’s published papers, or whether they’ve reported the issues to the journals, but have not heard back.\n\nLike Retraction Watch?

Make them as varied as Nuclear Gandhi, Cow Tipping, and Exploding Trousers.\n\nAll of them will lead you to the Wikipedia entry on Philosophy.\n\nIn 2017, three mathematicians from the University of Vermont published a paper titled Connecting Every Bit of Knowledge: The Structure of Wikipedia’s First Link Network. They tested this hypothesis over a dataset of 4.7 million English Wikipedia articles and found that philosophy was the page where the highest no. of articles ended.\n\n95% of all Wikipedia articles led to philosophy.\n\nMost of these articles were 10-30 clicks away from philosophy. Source and Credit (work done way back in 2011): Matt Kelcey\n\nWhat is the point of this?\n\nImagine you are sitting in a meeting at work. The discussion is around the plan your team had set in motion last quarter, and the results are being reviewed. Data is being twisted and harassed to confess to whatever version of reality the group wants to see. You are sitting there, and you see through the charade.\n\nYou’re wondering what the point of this is? You did not slog through life, battling inhuman entrance examinations, irrational parental expectations and eight rounds of interviews to get this coveted job, only to do this data jugglery. You’re wondering - why is nobody asking the fundamental, first principles questions? Why are we not questioning our premise? Why are we misinterpreting cause and effect? Why are we chasing these vanity metrics, when the metrics themselves are poor indicators of reality? Why have we accepted as gospel truth some ‘self-evident’ principles?\n\nThe meeting is adjourned, congratulatory messages are passed around, and a vague way forward is discussed. You shake your head, sigh deeply and groan internally, grab coffee and head to the next meeting.\n\nYou, my friend, are going through Epistemic Anxiety.\n\nAnxiety is an emotional response to risk. When we experience anxiety about an event, we perceive the risk to be real and possible, likely to occur in the near term. Epistemic Anxiety is the feeling of uneasiness, tension, and concern when you want to know the truth. You worry that your knowledge is incomplete and full of errors, and you may believe it. You either lack the resources, methods or agency to get to the truth.\n\nThe reason why Epistemic anxiety bothers you so much is because it is at odds with a universal human feeling: An innate desire for truth.\n\nIn a world of information overload, our epistemic anxiety is off the charts. We are constantly bombarded with so much information and misinformation, that our brains are losing the ability to sift through it. We are no longer able to parse the information we see, and thus, we default to our biases. We are aware of this, and that is why we want to live a life in which we can reduce this anxiety.\n\nBut the way to the ‘truth’ is a journey filled with complications, rife with uncertainty and overflowing with pitfalls.\n\nIf we were to embark on an intellectual journey that would lead us to this ‘truth’ and allow us to reduce epistemic anxiety, we would need to immerse ourselves in the world of ideas, those that are novel and beyond our current comprehension.\n\nBut before we get onto this journey, we need to take another one. Back in time to the year 1970, at the University of Cambridge.\n\nThe Game of Life\n\nJohn Conway was an English mathematician, who resembled a young Jack Nicholson from the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Apart from making contributions to the theory of finite groups, number theory, and combinatorial game theory, he was also known for growing a branch of mathematics called recreational mathematics.\n\nSimply put, math done for entertainment (gasp!)\n\nIn 1970, he invented a game called Conway’s Game of Life, which you and I are going to play. Don’t worry, it’s merely recreational mathematics.\n\nThe fun begins with the fact that it is a zero-player game.\n\nEh, what? What kind of game has no players?\n\nIt’s a game where the starting point defines the outcome. And it is governed by rules.\n\nDo you remember the first time you got your hands on a computer, probably in the school computer lab, where for some inexplicable reason, one had to take off shoes to enter?\n\nOne of the games you may have played was Minesweeper. A large grid with mines hidden in each cell, and you had to click in such a way that you did not trigger any mines.\n\nImagine a similar kind of grid. And instead of clicking, you define the starting point, saying how many of these cells are filled.\n\nConsider this as a random starting point\n\nYou can have as many or as few cells as you’d like. The game moves forward with the following rules\n\nAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nYou can play the game here. And if you play it long enough, with varying types and numbers of cells as starting points, something strange will happen.\n\nI urge you to not skip the video, as it is central to the understanding of this piece.\n\nWhat the f*ck did you just see? The Game of Life set to the haunting title track of the psychological drama film Requiem for a Dream!\n\nNow imagine if each of these darkened cells were ideas.\n\nSo what happens when you have just a few ideas? What happens if you have a few more?\n\nStill Lifes - which don’t change from one generation to the next.\n\nMost of them die.\n\nEven with enough cells, a pattern quickly emerges.\n\nAn Oscillator, By JokeySmurf\n\nBy surrounding ourselves with too few ideas, we let our ideas die. Our ideas become Still Lifes.\n\nBy surrounding ourselves with too many ideas of the same kind, we just recycle through the same ideas. Our ideas become Oscillators\n\nOur ideas need to be diverse. Our ideas need to be abundant.\n\nThis is not a theoretical argument.\n\nConway’s Game of Life is an example of emergence and self-organisation. When we surround ourselves with abundant, diverse ideas, complex ideas emerge. These ideas are unique and do not resemble the ideas from which they emerged.\n\nEven if the initial set of ideas seem simple and disconnected, spontaneous order can emerge, leading to brilliant ideas. Emergence and self-organisation are all around us. In the sciences, society, art and in nature.\n\nOk, but how to have novel ideas? In a life defined by the rhythms of work, relationships and traffic, how does one find the space to discover novel ideas consistently?\n\nArriving in Vielmere - Home of the Luminspire\n\nThe Lands of Vielmere, the world in which this piece is set\n\nTo understand this, we embark upon a journey, to the town of Vielmere. Located in a parallel universe and your reality at the same time, you drop anchor on its shore. Only to discover that this ain’t the most hospitable of towns. The locals are not necessarily welcoming, and they look tired. Their faces look ashen, their eyes red with resignation, and their shoulders droop. They spend their nights in town, but during the day, they are nowhere to be found.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are looking to scale Luminspire - The Mountains of Knowledge. Legend has it that the most learned of women and men reside high into the mountains. Shrouded in mist, choosing to live silently, these people pursue their field of knowledge assiduously. They rarely ever venture into town, and even if they do, most people ignore them, just as they ignored you.\n\nYou can see these mountains from town, but everyone tells you that to get there, you will need to navigate Moradoom - The Evergreen Forest of Late Stage Capitalism. That is where they spend their days.\n\nNavigating Moradoom - The Evergreen Forest of Late Stage Capitalism\n\nMoradoom was once a deciduous woodland forest. About 50 years ago, it was recolonised with a different species of trees - evergreen pine, spruce, fir and oak. In their original form, they used to be truly deciduous - changing with the seasons. Trees, shrubs and herbaceous perennials would lose all their leaves for a part of the year. This fall of leaves was governed by a combination of daylight and air temperatures. Many deciduous plants flowered during the period when they were leafless, as it increased the effectiveness of pollination. The absence of leaves improved wind transmission of pollen for wind-pollinated plants, and increased the visibility of the flowers to insects in insect-pollinated plants.\n\nUnfortunately, the evergreen trees which colonised Moradoom had mixed effects. There emerged two types of trees\n\nNurturing Deciduous Trees: The kind which provide fruit on alternate years, shade all around the year and firewood towards the end of their lives. They are canopy shy, grow slowly, and left to themselves, would live long healthy lives, providing for both man and animal.\n\nSwallowing Evergreen Trees: These trees grow to gigantic sizes, far surpassing the North American Redwoods. They provide fruit all the time, but seldom provide shade. They grow quickly, are a perennial source of firewood, and grow so closely together that their canopies merge into each other. Thus, they block sunlight so effectively, that the entire forest is engulfed in darkness. They intensify the competition for sunlight, water and nutrients, thereby depriving nurturing trees of the resources they need. They accelerate the spread of disease, thereby leading to the demise of smaller ground-loving vegetation such as shrubs and grasses.\n\nAnd they swallow entire human lives - physically and emotionally.\n\nThe nature of our work feels like navigating Moradoom. The swallowing trees are so high that we cannot climb them, and thus we cannot get sunlight. They are so densely packed together that trying to squeeze past them only means falling, hurting and bruising ourselves. In the process of feeding these trees, we sacrifice our mind and body. They are relentless in their asks - They always want more, and each time we give more, we are marked as someone from whom more can be extracted. The cost of their evergreen fruit is paid through the ever increasingly exploitation of our leisure time. We nurture these trees with tears of our dead dreams and the graves of our relationships. And the only fruit you get is the one that falls on the ground, a consolation disguised as reward.\n\nGetting stuck in Moradoom is easy. In all likelihood, if you’ve read this far, you and I are both stuck in it. It often takes us decades to emerge out of it, but by then we have lost our best years chasing the consolatory fruit. Each day we spend time in Moradoom, and return to our homes at night. What should be a refuge from the tyranny of the forest becomes the cage. We pay increasingly higher emotional and monetary costs to maintain these cages - our rents are always going up, the EMIs never seem to end and there is always something to fix in the house. Whatever is left, we burn it in the meaningless cycle of upgrading - Things we buy to impress people who don’t care about us. Or worse, to impress yourself.\n\nWe live in cages devoid of doors and windows, we live in cages where hope suffocates\n\nBut there is a way to escape Moradoom, there is a way to find more nurturing deciduous trees, there is a way to cut down the swallowing evergreen trees\n\nThe Axe of Satisfaction.\n\nThe Axe of Satisfaction\n\nIn August 2018, in the last month of my three-month sabbatical, I arrived at the Hamta village in Himachal Pradesh. I rented a one-room cottage, and my caretakers were Dolma Aunty and Kalzang Uncle, a couple well into their 70’s. And while a handful of tourists like me came and went, their constant companion was their mountain dog Rambo, who unfortunately lost his eyesight to snow-blindness. Uncle and Aunty used to cook for me, and they also became my companions.\n\nDolma Aunty and I settled into a routine. I would walk up to the dhaba, making my way through a pagdandi (loose path) which was nestled amongst apple and apricot trees. It was the rainy season, and the entire mountain was lush green, with wildflowers accentuating the beauty of the mountains. The white wildflowers were a particular favourite - I’d love to gaze at them and the good old Rambo would love to smell and rub his nose in them.\n\nMy mornings started with a sweet pahadi chai with Aunty, as we sat leisurely outside the dhaba, doing something which only the pahadis know best - Dhoop Sekana. A practice which we are losing with urban living. I find it difficult to translate what Dhoop Sekana means - But imagine yourself sitting on a chatai or a chair in cold weather, in a verandah or on a terrace. It’s early morning and the sun has come up, gently beginning to warm your body. You’re enveloped by silence all around you, occasionally punctuated by the sounds of birds calling out to each other. A sense of coziness starts building. Time passes leisurely, and you sit without a care in the world.\n\nAs I sipped my tea, I often got into conversations with Aunty. She was curious about my life - of moving away from home for an education and a job, and how I was able to constantly switch cities every few years. Of how home was never a place, but the people who mattered in my life. I, in turn, was amazed by how they seemed to live completely off their land and were happy with so little.\n\nAnd when I said this to her, she gave me a puzzled look and she said “What makes you think I have so little? I have everything that I need”\n\nI was surprised, and I said - I am sure that you could do with a few more things, a few more comforts that would make your life easier. It would make you happier too.\n\nAnd in the most normal way she said - es.ulpgc.dacd.businessunit.Main santusht hoon (I am satisfied).\n\nThe one month of simple living in the Himalayas taught me the importance of satisfaction. I lived in a one-room cottage, with a single mattress, a chair and a bookshelf. One single bulb illuminated the room, and power cuts were the norm. Despite being used to the comforts of urban living, all it took me was a few days to settle into a routine. Outside the first few days, being hard with this drastic change, I was able to find contentment in the slow pace of living. And just as easily, once I returned to my regular life, I slipped back into my old patterns, unable to break out of my unhealthy habits, and yet somewhere Dolma Aunty’s voice stayed in my head.\n\nWe need the Axe of Satisfaction to cut through the Swallowing Evergreen Trees. Their evergreen desire to exploit us is only rivalled by our evergreen desire to give in. The Netflix documentary Buy Now! The Shopping Conspiracy tells us that this behaviour is deeply damaging to the world we live in.\n\nBecause the moment we find a sense of satisfaction, our need to elevate our status through overconsumption of objects and experiences will diminish. We will no longer have status anxiety and we will worry far less about how the world perceives us.\n\nBut even if we cut through Moradoom and emerge with a clear understanding of what satisfies us, we are going to run into another challenge.\n\nArriving at Igamor - The Disorienting Caves of Ignorance\n\nTake a moment and reflect on your life. Think about where you grew up, who your early influences were, the schools and universities you went to, and the jobs you did. Remember the people who crossed paths with you, some stayed on, but most moved away.\n\nIf you had the typical Millennial experience that I did, you have lived through a time of one of the most rapid changes in human history. We leapt from the industrial age to the information age to ‘whatever this mess we live in’ is called. As humans, we became such a force of planetary change, that scientists are debating if we should coin it as an entirely new geological epoch called the Anthropocene.\n\nThe rapid change also brought in societal upheaval around the key pillars which define modern societies: Gender, Race and Religion. Closer home, we are living in a country, where as young women become more liberal, young men are turning more conservative, and even within this, North-Central vs South India differs. Men are increasingly finding it hard to understand and explain their position in the world and what masculinity means. Religion is a central tension point in Indian politics, and our class and caste struggles are nowhere near resolution. Even if you consider the urban elite of India (folks like you and me), who are insulated from the ‘Rest of India’, the economic anxiety is stifling. The Indian Millennial today is living under The Great Squeeze. We have been pushed to achieve everything in a short period, and are hyper-focused towards our goals. Goals that are physically, emotionally and economically crushing us.\n\nAmidst all this, we are supposed to reconcile what we know (things we learnt growing up) with the new information that presents in front of us. But the new information comes in the form of an overload - too much, too complex and too dense to process. So what do we do?\n\nThe Greek philosopher Plato captured this conundrum well, which is known as the Allegory of the Cave.\n\nImagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from childhood. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not to look around at the cave, each other, or themselves.\n\nBehind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets \"of men and other living things\"\n\nThe people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do. The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them; they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls; the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows.\n\nThe shadows become reality.\n\nNow suppose that the prisoner is released. A freed prisoner would look around and see the fire. The light would hurt his eyes and make it difficult for him to see the objects casting the shadows. If he were told that what he is seeing is real instead of the other version of reality he sees on the wall, he would not believe it.\n\nIn his pain, the freed prisoner would turn away and run back to what he is accustomed to.\n\nWhen we are faced with something that genuinely challenges our worldview, we choose ignorance. Caring only about the things which immediately affect us. Consuming only that which our senses can easily perceive. We fall back on what we know, we revert to our biases. We make our known ignorance a source of truth. And at its heart, this ignorance is disorienting.\n\nSo how do we get out of the cave?\n\nPlato believes that the only way to escape the cave is to not privilege sensation but thought.\n\nIn our world obsessed with consumption of experiences and things, we have put ‘sensation’ on a pedestal, making it the hallmark of a life well lived. We value things which appeal to our eyes, our nose, our tongue and our ears. Most of all, we privilege things which are best appreciated by our bodies. Plato says that it is ideas, and not the material world known to us through sensation, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality.\n\nThe simplest way to have ideas take centre stage in our lives, the smallest step we can take to escape the disorienting caves of ignorance is to annihilate the darkness of these caves with\n\nThe Torch of Curiosity.\n\nyo_runner A post shared by @yo_runner\n\nThe Woman who saved a Billion Lives\n\nIf you time travelled to the year 1923, specifically to the seaside town of Worthing in West Sussex, England, you would find two little girls pottering around with their portable mineral analysis kit. Their fascination was pebbles, and not completely by accident, because their parents were archaeologists in Egypt. One of the girls was named Dorothy, and in 1928, she joined her parents at the archaeological site of Jerash, in present-day Jordan, where she documented the patterns of mosaics from multiple Byzantine-era Churches dated to the 5th–6th centuries.\n\nShe spent more than a year finishing the drawings as she started her studies in Oxford, while also conducting chemical analyses of glass tesserae from the same site. She had developed a keen interest in chemistry, so much so, that on her 16th birthday her mother gave her a book by W. H. Bragg on X-ray crystallography, \"Concerning the Nature of Things\"\n\nThis book proved pivotal to her eventual interests. In 1932, Dorothy Hodgkin began a PhD at Cambridge, and it was then that she became aware of the potential of X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of proteins. And her undying curiosity about the structure of things - from pebbles to proteins, found the catalyst that would soon shape the modern world - X-ray crystallography.\n\nIn the year 1945, Hodgkin and her colleagues, including biochemist Barbara Low, solved the structure of Penicillin, which went against all contemporary understanding of the antibiotic.\n\nIn 1948, Hodgkin first encountered one of the most structurally complex vitamins known to civilization. At the time, its structure was almost completely unknown, and when Hodgkin discovered it contained cobalt, she realized the structure actualization could be determined by X-ray crystallography analysis. The study published by Hodgkin was described as being as significant \"as breaking the sound barrier\". The vitamin is well known to the urban Indian elite, for so many of us are deficient in it - Vitamin B12.\n\nBut the crowning glory of her life came after a struggle of three decades, which started back in 1934.\n\nThe British organic chemist Robert Robinson offered a small sample of a crystalline hormone to Dorothy. The hormone captured her imagination because of the intricate and wide-ranging effect it has in the body. However, at this stage X-ray crystallography had not been developed far enough to cope with the complexity of the molecule. She and others spent many years improving the technique.\n\nIt took 35 years after taking her first photograph of the crystal for X-ray crystallography and computing techniques to be able to tackle larger and more complex molecules. Hodgkin's dream of unlocking the structure of that hormone was put on hold until 1969 when she was finally able to work with her team of young, international scientists to uncover the structure for the first time. The hormone we all know too well today.\n\nInsulin\n\nHodgkin's work with insulin was instrumental in paving the way for insulin to be mass-produced and used on a large scale for treatment of both Type I and Type II diabetes.\n\nDorothy Hodgkin went from studying pebbles in streams to uncovering and understanding the nature of penicillin, vitamin B12 and insulin.\n\nWork which has easily saved the life of a billion people.\n\nAll driven by wielding the Torch of Curiosity.\n\nHodgkin solved her and our ignorance by constantly applying the torch of curiosity. And I’d happily assume if you’ve clicked on this piece and are still reading, you are a curious person.\n\nSo let us for a moment assume that you have not only cut through Moradoom - The evergreen forest of late stage capitalism, but have also escaped Igamor - The disorienting caves of ignorance.\n\nBut my friend, you are now caught right in the middle of Evermore.\n\nNavigating Evermore - The River of Responsibilities\n\nIn 2013, Yitang Zhang, a former accountant who worked at a Subway franchise, called his wife “Pay attention to the media and newspapers”, he said. “You may see my name”\n\nand she said\n\n“Are you drunk?”\n\nYou should not blame Zhang’s wife. Every other man who walks this earth thinks his thoughts and ideas are stuff of genius. I don’t have data for this, but I have a strong feeling that many women would agree.\n\nZhang met his wife at a Chinese restaurant in Long Island, New York, where she was a waitress. He was born in Shanghai in 1955. His mother was a secretary in a government office, and his father was a college professor whose field was electrical engineering. As a small boy, he began “trying to know everything in mathematics,” he said. “I became very thirsty for math.”\n\nHis parents moved to Beijing for work, and Zhang remained in Shanghai with his grandmother. Mao’s Cultural Revolution had closed the schools. He spent most of his time reading math books that he ordered from a bookstore for less than a dollar.\n\nEventually, Zhang moved to Beijing to study at Peking University, China’s most respected school, and subsequently moved to Purdue University for his PhD. He earned his doctorate in 1991 and then disappeared from the mathematics scene.\n\nHe lived, sometimes with friends, in Lexington, Kentucky, where he had occasional work at a motel, and in New York City, where he also had friends and occasional work. Zhang found a job keeping the books at a Subway franchise. When Zhang wasn’t working, he would go to the library at the University of Kentucky and read journals in algebraic geometry and number theory. “For years, I didn’t really keep up my dream in mathematics,” he said.\n\nIn 1999, through the help of a friend, he secured a teaching position at the University of New Hampshire. He was still a nobody in the world of mathematics.\n\nHe rented an apartment about four miles from campus and rode to and from his office with students on a school shuttle. He said that he likes to sit on the bus and think.\n\nSeven days a week, he arrived at his office around eight or nine and stayed until six or seven. The longest he had taken off from thinking was two weeks. Sometimes he woke up in the morning thinking of a math problem he had been considering when he fell asleep. Outside his office is a long corridor that he liked to walk up and down. Otherwise, he walked outside.\n\nThe man took his routine more seriously than most of us do.\n\nAnd you’d ask, what is so remarkable about that?\n\nIt’s remarkable because the call to his wife was not a drunk phone call. He was serious.\n\nOn April 17, 2013, without telling anyone, he sent a paper to Annals of Mathematics, widely regarded as the profession’s most prestigious journal. When the reviewers completed their review of it, they came back with the following comments\n\n“We have completed our study of the paper ‘Bounded Gaps Between Primes’ by Yitang Zhang.” They went on, “The main results are of the first rank. The author has succeeded in proving a landmark theorem in the distribution of prime numbers.” And, “Although we studied the arguments very thoroughly, we found it very difficult to spot even the smallest slip. . . . We are very happy to strongly recommend acceptance of the paper for publication in the Annals.”\n\nHis paper was a back-door attack on the Twin Prime Conjecture, one of the greatest open problems in mathematics. It asserts that there are an infinite number of prime numbers that are only two numbers apart (Think 5 and 7, 11 and 13, the difference is always 2). Such pairs are more frequent at the beginning of the number line and less so among large numbers.\n\nZhang’s result did not prove that there are an infinite number of twin primes; rather, it gives a finite upper bound––70 million––for which the gaps between pairs of primes persist infinitely often.\n\nBig deal, you’d say. The gap between 2 (the conjecture) and 70 million (what Zhang proved) is a factor of 35 million. But what we fail to account for is that the result is infinitely better than the gap between 2 and infinity. The people who had come closest to proving the twin-prime conjecture, had this to say\n\n“What Zhang did was sensational. His work is a masterpiece. When you talk of number theory, a lot of the beauty is the machinery. Zhang somehow completely understood the situation, even though he was working alone. That’s how he surprised us.” “Written with crystalline clarity and a total command of the topic’s current state of the art, he has proved one of the great results in the history of number theory.” “He’s not a known expert, but he succeeded where all the experts had failed.”\n\nZhang is a classic example of the power of routine. Even in mathematical obscurity, he consistently went to the library and kept abreast of the developments in algebraic geometry and number theory. He worked every day - the same hours, at the same place, with little to no change in his routine. Zhang had finished “Bounded Gaps Between Primes” in late 2012; and then he spent a few months methodically checking each step, which he said was “very boring.”\n\nZhang’s work was never about the hustle culture which envelopes and consumes us, just like the swallowing trees of Moradoom do. His routine is a beautiful poem, pithy with a clear message - Consistency over Flashes of Brilliance. Repeatability over Spontaneous Genius.\n\nIn our lives, we are all wading through Evermore - The River of Responsibilities. At any given point, a million things are running in our heads, and if you are a woman, more so. Everything from kids to money to water heater repairs to the worst question every adult has to answer, “What are we going to eat today?”\n\nTo navigate the river of responsibilities, we need the\n\nOars of Routine\n\nYes, the boring routines, which feel like wading through a river, with our backs hunched over, and the oars being our only support\n\nNavigating the river of responsibilities needs tact - One cannot go against the flow for too long. When your child needs attention in a meaningful way, you need to be present. When that presentation deadline is looming, you need to hunker down and get the work done. But if we are to stop and observe the cadence of our lives, we will notice the patterns - How responsibilities pile up around certain times of the day/week/month or year. How we are repeatedly making predictable, poor choices, taking suboptimal decisions consistently.\n\nAll of these can be navigated with the oars of routine.\n\nRoutines are amazing in one single way - They take away the need to make decisions. Decisions about mundane things, which need to be made in a short amount of time. Our dopamine hungry, stress addled brains are being asked to do too much, too often. A carefully crafted routine will free up both physical time and mental space to allow for our curiosity to thrive.\n\nBecause after cutting through Moradoom with the Axe of Satisfaction, escaping Igamor with the Torch of Curiosity and navigating Evermore with the Oars of Routine, we finally arrive at the starting point of our destination.\n\nArriving at Luminspire - The Mountains of Knowledge\n\nYou’re here. And ahead of you lies an entire mountain range. As far as the eye can see, you can see peaks one after the other. You look around and realise you are on a peak yourself. How did you get here?\n\nBy doing what you have been doing for years. Each of us, by accident or by choice, has picked out a career or an area to work in. Working with a multitude of people, clients and partners in that area, you have developed an expertise in it. So much so, that it comes naturally to you, and you sometimes forget to consider it as a valued skill. You use it effortlessly at work and advise younger folks who are trying to grow their knowledge in the space. Your skill drives considerable impact, and you are rightfully an expert in that space.\n\nAnd as you stand on the peak, you can make out that other experts are standing on other peaks. Peaks you know something about, peaks you have just heard of and peaks you did not even know existed. You try and shout to communicate with them, but they cannot hear you. Your voice merely echoes, ricocheting off the surface of the mountain. You’d like to get onto another peak, speak to the expert sitting on it. You want to engage them in conversation and learn from them, but it would require you to do something hard.\n\nGet off your peak.\n\nBecause getting off your peak would mean going through the discomfort of abandoning all notions of knowledge, and being willing to become a student again. You will need to accept that you know nothing about this new peak.\n\nThomas Szasz, a Hungarian-American psychiatrist, once remarked\n\nEvery act of conscious learning requires the willingness to suffer an injury to one's self-esteem. That is why young children, before they are aware of their own self-importance, learn so easily; and why older persons, especially if vain or important, cannot learn at all.\n\nWe all need to come down from our peaks. For us to truly learn something, we need to abandon our views about it. Because the act of coming down from the peak forces us to do three things\n\nUnderstand the limits of our thinking: As we come down, and shed our views, we start seeing our field of knowledge more objectively, and understand that there are limits to our thinking, even though we are experts. Open space for contemplation: Once we come down, and make our way to another peak, we start walking, which opens the space for contemplation. Isolate ourselves from our ego: Once we have stripped ourselves of our views, and contemplated, we isolate ourselves from our Ego. This act of isolation humbles us, makes us realise our follies and helps us see illusions we have lived under.\n\nAnd once you do that, you possibly put yourself on a path, on which Paul Erdős walked for decades.\n\nPaul Erdős - The World’s Most Influential Mathematician you’ve never heard of\n\nImagine being so prolific and collaborative, that the mathematical community comes together to name a number after you - Erdős number. No, not the kind of constants we had to mug up in physics and chemistry. Not Avogadro’s number or the value of gravity at the surface of the earth.\n\nSample this.\n\nAn Erdős number describes a person's degree of separation from Erdős himself, based on their collaboration with him, or with another who has their own Erdős number. Erdős alone was assigned the Erdős number of 0 (for being himself), while his immediate collaborators could claim an Erdős number of 1, their collaborators have Erdős number at most 2, and so on.\n\nApproximately 200,000 mathematicians have an assigned Erdős number, and some have estimated that 90 percent of the world's active mathematicians have an Erdős number smaller than 8.\n\nImagine, for a second, that 90% of the people in your field are connected with you via collaborators.\n\nHe worked with more than 500 collaborators. He firmly believed mathematics to be a social activity, living an itinerant lifestyle with the sole purpose of writing mathematical papers with other mathematicians. He devoted his waking hours to mathematics, even into his later years; he died at a mathematics conference in Warsaw in 1996.\n\nTime magazine called him \"The Oddball's Oddball\".\n\nPossessions meant little to Erdős; most of his belongings would fit in a suitcase. Awards and other earnings were generally donated to people in need and various worthy causes. He spent most of his life traveling between scientific conferences, universities, and the homes of colleagues worldwide. He earned enough stipends to fund his travels and basic needs as a guest lecturer at universities and from various mathematical awards.\n\nHe would typically show up at a colleague's doorstep and announce \"my brain is open\", staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator about whom to visit next.\n\nAfter his mother died in 1971, he started taking antidepressants and amphetamines. His friend, the American mathematician, Ron Graham bet him $500 that he could not stop taking them for a month.\n\nErdős won the bet but complained that it impacted his performance: \"You've showed me I'm not an addict. But I didn't get any work done. I'd get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. I'd have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You've set mathematics back a month.\"\n\nAfter he won the bet, he promptly resumed his use of antidepressants and amphetamines.\n\nOverall, his work leaned towards solving previously open problems, rather than developing or exploring new areas of mathematics. Erdős published around 1,500 mathematical papers during his lifetime, a figure that remains unsurpassed.\n\nErdős was so prolific because he collaborated. He was aware of the limits of his knowledge, and actively sought collaborators to move mathematics ahead. He was willing to let go of his ego and enmesh himself with other experts. He was willing to get down from his peak, walk, and climb the next peak. And do it all over again. Over an entire lifetime.\n\nSo in a life, where meeting new people and making new friends is hard in your 30’s and 40’s, how could you possibly find experts and collaborators? When each of us is enmeshed in our fields and sub-fields, how are we to isolate and enmesh ourselves with others?\n\nBuilding and Finding Communities\n\nOn 8th April 2024, Deepak ‘Chuck’ Gopalakrishnan and I started a little experiment. We launched The 6% Club, where we hoped to help people launch their newsletters, podcasts or YouTube channels. We expected 10 people to sign up.\n\n80 did.\n\nWe had to limit the size of the cohort to 40, and open another cohort in July, which had to accommodate the other 40. And while we were thrilled to have such an overwhelming response, we did not even anticipate the hidden benefits we would accrue.\n\nHow often do you meet smart, thoughtful, empathetic and creative people?\n\nHow often do you meet them, 40 at a time?\n\nHow often do you meet a fresh set of 40, four times a year?\n\nOver the past year, across four cohorts, we have had the privilege to intimately know 150+ such people. I am floored by the dumb luck we are experiencing - Just as a sample: We have mentored wildlife photographers, physicians, scientists, painters, professors and ultramarathoners. Even someone who has an Erdős number of 2. We have mentored people who have gone through life-changing trauma, and have subsequently turned their life around (which btw is deeply embarrassing because what can I teach them?). We have had the privilege of seeing thoughtful newsletters, vulnerable podcasts and beautiful YouTube channels come to life. And we can claim a tiny piece of credit for them.\n\nEveryday, I get the opportunity to climb down from my peak, and ask these folks elementary questions, and have them indulge me with an equanimity only surpassed by the experts facing Philomena Cunk.\n\nEveryday, I get the privilege of having these people being one message or call away. I could even call some of them, friends.\n\nYou may not be at a point in life to be able to build such a community. But you can find experts and collaborators. Here is how you could do it\n\nDefine 1-2 areas you’d want to learn about. Something you have been genuinely curious about, ideally for a long time. Ask EVERYONE you know - Hey, I am interested in learning about Y. Do you know someone who knows a lot about Y? Once you find a connection, ask for a warm introduction. I can almost guarantee you, the expert will be happy to give you their time. Ask thoughtful questions. Don’t expect them to explain things to you, but ask them to point you to resources, or craft a learning path with them. Put in the hours, immerse yourself in the resources and update them about the progress you have made and the things you have learnt. This in turn will start a conversation. Repeat 1 - 6 for the rest of your life.\n\nAnd what will happen?\n\nYou have kickstarted your own version of ‘The Game of Life’. Remember, the Game of Life has only one variable: The starting point. You now have not just ideas from your field, but ideas from fields you know nothing about. You will now see ‘emergence’ in action.\n\nI’ve experienced this first hand. Take this Substack for example. My initial pieces were in the style I typically wrote in - Text, with a few images. Then, through one of the cohort members of The 6% Club, I was introduced to the writings of More to That. A few years earlier, thanks to an early conversation with Nishant Jain (aka SneakyArtist), who encouraged me to sketch, I got over my fears and picked up sketching with a pen. How did I discover him? By listening to him on Amit Varma’s The Seen and The Unseen. I just reached out to him, and got a conversation going. I showed him my early sketches and he gave me feedback. I sought another expert in Khushboo Prashant whose course taught me the basics of linework. With her kindness and patience, she gave me extensive feedback on my sketching (and all of them gave me faith in the generosity of experts).\n\nCombined with my existential questions, pieces like these (and the last three, here, here and here) were born. I take inspiration (which includes me trying to copy their style and fail) from multiple artists for the linework and sketches you see in the pieces. Now with this one, I tried my hand at drawing a fantasy map, coming up with names for all the places (which I could not, and my fantasy fiction loving partner did). I have used watercolours extensively to bring the map alive, and I will let you decide how good/bad/ugly it is.\n\nCould I have elevated my writing without all these experts? Not a chance in hell. They may not be my collaborators today, but who knows what the future holds?\n\nThe unknowability of a future filled with the potential of giving birth to new ideas and projects is what makes life worth living.\n\nSo there you have it - The key to living an intellectually rich life. But there is one step missing.\n\nDocument your intellectual journey\n\nWrite physically in a journal, write on your phone, write on your laptop. Write on whatever latest gadget you’ve gotten your hands on.\n\nWrite notes, single line ideas, thoughts, quotes. Doodle, sketch, paint. Write entire pieces in long form, by hand.\n\nWrite for no one but yourself. The act of writing forces you to think clearly. It makes you commit your ideas to paper in a logical flow. It allows you to make connections you did not see earlier. It allows you to come up with ideas that seemed implausible. Writing is emergence, of the ideas and the self.\n\nEarly notes from my journal for developing this piece. Messy yes, Fun YES.\n\nIt does not have to follow a pattern. It does not have to make sense. I blend lived experience, mathematics and science with philosophy, and sprinkle it with some art.\n\nWhy do I mix the two?\n\nBecause the arts and the sciences are not different. As Sarah Hart, the eclectic author of Once Upon a Prime says\n\nMath and Literature are complementary parts of the same quest: To understand human life and our place in the universe.\n\nYou will find your formula too. You have to trust the process\n\nAfter all, aren’t we all trying to understand our place in the universe?\n\nThank you for reading this far. I am grateful that you gave me 30 minutes of your time. I hope some part of this made you feel heard or helped you feel, think and live better.\n\nI have one last thing to say. I along with a friend run The 6% Club, a content creation program designed for people with full-time jobs. We help you launch your newsletter, podcast or YouTube channel in 45 days. We neither promise virality nor algorithm hacking, but a sustainable, enjoyable way to build a creative outlet for yourself. We have helped 150+ people so far and could help you too."}

Donald Trump declared that he had fired the commissioners. That is, functionally, he announced a desire that he should have the power to fire FTC commissioners and named the commissioners that he would fire if he were to have that power—a power which he does not, within the bounds of the law and the constitution, possess.\n\n“It is hard to fit that into a headline!” Scocca and McLeod acknowledged. “Yet it is essential for news outlets to find a way.” I wish I saw more of an effort toward that goal, and less of the brain-breaking examples of headline torture I saw in last week’s Times’ account of Trump’s strong-arming of the GOP, titled, “Trump, With More Honey Than Vinegar, Cements an Iron Grip on Republicans.” Does that set a new standard for the mixed metaphor? Between vinegar, honey, cement, and iron, it certainly sets a mixed-media record.\n\nOr consider a report of a more recent vintage from The Washington Post: “Trump has a plan to remake the economy. But he’s not explaining it very well.” The piece reduces the trouble the president is having on the economic front—where for the first time he’s underwater on polls—to one in which he’s left the investor class with insufficient insight into his master plan. In this telling, the president’s claims of a soon-to-arrive golden age are taken at face value. “If the administration’s plan succeeds, the $30 trillion U.S. economy would be remade,” the article claims, adding that the United States was set to become “even more self-sufficient, producing more of its energy, lumber, steel and computer chips than ever before.”\n\nPaul Krugman greeted this article’s array of assertions and unfalsifiable claims with something more reality-based: “I don’t know about you, but I don’t think Trump’s problem is that he’s doing a poor job of explaining his plan. I think his problem is that he’s offering fake answers to fake problems, and the public—unlike, apparently, the Washington Post—isn’t buying it.” That seems right to me. Beyond that, if anyone is actually in need of an “explanation” about Trump’s economic plans, I’d say that once you understand that everything proceeds from the fact that the president is an omnidirectionally corrupt moron whose desperate need for adulation fuels his every decision, with the added problem that he has, since his first term, become more intellectually infirm, everything starts to make sense. The constant whiplashing between implementing and retracting tariffs, the constant characterization of prosperity as a bad thing, the wild-eyed talk of how economic hardship will finally set us all free—all of this stems from the simple fact that the man at the top is a deceitful asshole with a cranial cavity full of damp parsley."}

In the early 1900s, recorded music was still a novelty, overshadowed by sales of sheet music. Early vinyl records were vastly different from what we think of today: discs were sold individually and could only hold up to four minutes of music per side. Sometimes, only one side of the record was used. One of the most popular records of 1910, for example, was “Come, Josephine, in My Flying Machine”: it clocked in at two minutes and 39 seconds. An example of early album art via Wikipedia The packaging of these records was strictly utilitarian: a brown paper sleeve to protect the record from dust, printed with the name of the record label or the retailer. Rarely did the packaging include any information on the disc inside; the label on the center of the disc was all there was to differentiate one record from another. But as record sales started to show signs of life, music publishers took note. Columbia Records, one of the first companies to sell music on discs, was especially successful. They pioneered the sale of songs in bundles: the individual discs were bound together in packages resembling photo albums, partly to protect the delicate shellac that the records were made of, partly to increase their sales. They resembled photo albums, so Columbia called them “record albums.” There were many more technological breakthroughs that made it possible to mass-manufacture and distribute music throughout the world at affordable prices. The five-minute-long 78 rpm discs were replaced by 20-minute discs that ran at 33 ⅓ rpm, which were replaced by the hour-long 12″ LP we know today. Delicate shellac was replaced by the more resilient (and cheaper) vinyl. Both recording technology and consumer electronics were always evolving, allowing more dynamic music to fit into smaller packages and be played on smaller, higher-fidelity stereos. The invention of album art can get lost in the story of technological mastery. But among all the factors that contributed to the rise of recorded music, it stands as one of the few that was wholly driven by creators themselves. Album art — first as marketing material, then as pure creative expression — turned an audio-only medium into a multi-sensory experience. This is the story of the people who made music visible. The prophet: Alex Steinweiss Alex Steinweiss was born in 1917, the son of eastern European immigrants. Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, Steinweiss took an early interest in art and earned a scholarship to Parsons School of Design. On graduating, he worked for Austrian designer Joseph Binder, whose bold, graphic posters had influenced design for the first decades of the 1900s.\n\nJoseph Binder, The Most Important Wheels in America, Association of American Railroads (1952) via Moma Joseph Binder, Österreichs Wiederaufbau Ausstellung Salzburg (1933) via Moma Joseph Binder, Air Corps U.S. Army (Winning entry for the MoMA National Defense Poster Competition [Army Air Corps Recruiting]) via Moma\n\nAfter his work with Binder, Steinweiss was hired by Columbia Records to produce promotional displays and ads, but the job didn’t stick. At the outbreak of World War II, he went to work for the Navy’s Training and Development Center in New York City, designing teaching material and cautionary posters. When the war ended, Steinweiss went back to freelancing for Columbia. At a lunch meeting in 1948, company president Ted Wallerstein mentioned that Columbia would soon introduce a new kind of record that, spinning at a slower speed of 33 ⅓ rpm, could hold more music than the older 78 rpm discs. But there was a problem: the smaller, more intricate grooves on the discs were being damaged by the heavy paper sleeves used for the 78s. After the lunch, Steinweiss went to work to create a new, safer jacket for the records. But his vision for the new packaging went beyond just its construction. “The way records were sold was ridiculous,” Steinweiss said. “The covers were brown, tan or green paper. They were not attractive, and lacked sales appeal.” He suggested that Columbia should spend more money on packaging, convinced that eye-catching designs would help sell records. His first chance to prove his case was a 1940 compilation by the songwriters Rodgers and Hart — one of the first releases on the new microgroove 33 ⅓ records. For it, he asked the Imperial Theater (located one block west of Times Square) to change the lettering on their marquee to read “SMASH SONG HITS BY RODGERS & HART.\" Steinweiss had a photographer take a photo, and back in his studio, superimposed “COLUMBIA RECORDS’’ on the image to match the perspective and style of the signage. The last touch, a nod to the graphic abstraction of his mentor Joseph Binder, were orange lines arcing around the marquee in the exact size of the record underneath. Album art was born. Steinweiss' cover art for Columbia's Smash Song Hits by Rodgers & Hart via RateYourMusic Steinweiss would go on to design hundreds of covers for Columbia from 1940 to 1945. His methodology was rigorous; the covers went beyond nice pictures to be visual representations of the music itself. Before most people owned a TV set, Steinweiss’s album covers were affordable multi-sensory entertainment. Looking at the album cover and listening to the music created an experience that was more than the sum of its parts. “I tried to get into the subject,” he explains, \"either through the music, or the life and times of the composer. For example, with a Bartók piano concerto, I took the elements of the piano—the hammers, keys, and strings—and composed them in a contemporary setting using appropriate color and rendering. Since Bartók is Hungarian, I also put in the suggestion of a peasant figure.” Steinweiss' cover art for Columbia's recording of Bartók's Concerto No. 3 via RateYourMusic Steinweiss was prophetic: His colorful compositions sold records. Newsweek reported that sales of Bruno Walter’s recording of Beethoven’s “Eroica” symphony increased 895% with its new Steinweiss cover.” Steinweiss' cover art for Columbia's recording of Beethoven's Eroica The challenger: Reid Miles From 1940 to 1950, Columbia Records was the dominant force in music sales. Buoyed by Steinweiss’s initial successes, Columbia hired more artists and designers to produce album art. Jim Flora led the charge from 1947–1950 with irreverent illustrations and more daring explorations of typography, and like Steinweiss, his work mirrored the music on the records. During the era, Columbia began to focus much more on popular music. Flora’s campy compositions screamed “this isn’t your parent’s music.”\n\nJim Flora's cover for Gene Krupa and His Orchestra via JimFlora.com Jim Flora's cover for Bix and Tram via JimFlora.com Jim Flora's cover for Kid Ory and His Creole Jazz Band via JimFlora.com\n\nBut while Columbia was focusing on making it into the hit parade, an upstart label was honing in on a sound that would come to define the era; Blue Note Records, founded in 1939, was fixated on the jazz underground. From its founding and throughout the 1950s, Blue Note focused on “hot jazz,” a mutant strain of jazz descending from the big band swing era, often including twangy banjoes, wailing clarinets, and rambunctious New Orleans second-line-style drumming. Founder Alfred Lion wrote the label’s manifesto: Blue Note Records are designed simply to serve the uncompromising expressions of hot jazz or swing, in general. Any particular style of playing which represents an authentic way of musical feeling is genuine expression. … Blue Note records are concerned with identifying its impulse, not its sensational and commercial adornments. One way Blue Note stood out from labels like Columbia was their dedication to their artists. Many of the working musicians of the ’50s lived like vampires, waking up after dusk and playing gigs into the early hours of the morning, then rehearsing until dawn. Blue Note would record their artists in the pre-dawn hours, giving musicians time to rest up before their next night’s gigs started. Art Blakey, Thelonius Monk, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and John Coltrane are household names now; but then, because of their drinking, drug use, and frenetic schedules, labels wouldn’t work with them. Blue Note embraced them, feeding their fires of creative innovation and creating an updraft for the insurgency of jazz to come. Album art was one more revolutionary way for Blue Note to explore “genuine expression.” Just as they fostered talented musicians, they’d give young designers a chance to shine. Alfred Lion’s childhood friend Francis Wolff had joined the label as a producer and photographer; he’d shoot candid portraits of the musicians as they worked. Then, designers like Paul Bacon, Gil Mellé (himself a musician), and John Hermansader would pair Wolff’s black-and-white photos with a single, bright color, then juxtapose them with stark, sans-serif type.\n\nPaul Bacon's cover featuring Francis Wolff's photography for Thelonious Monk's Genius of Modern Music Vol. 1 via Deep Groove Mono Gil Mellé's cover featuring Francis Wolff's photography for his band's New Faces — New Sounds via Deep Groove Mono John Hermansader's cover featuring Francis Wolff's photography for George Wallington's Showcase via Deep Groove Mono\n\nAs the 1960s approached, the musicians Blue Note worked so hard to cultivate were forging new styles, leaving behind the swing-era pretense of jazz as dance music. Charlie Parker and Bud Powell kept speeding up the tempo and stuffing more chords into progressions. Max Roach started playing the drums like a boxer, bobbing and weaving around the beat with skittering cymbals, waiting for the right moment to land a single monumental “thud” of a kick drum. Without the drums keeping a steady rhythm, bass players like Milt Hinton and Gene Ramey had to furiously mark out time with eighth notes, traversing chords by plucking up and down the scale. This was bebop, and it was musicians’ music. Blue Note’s ethos of artistic integrity was the perfect Petri dish for virtuosic musicians to develop innovative sounds — they worked in small ensembles, often just five players, constantly scrambling and re-arranging instrumentation, playing harder and faster and louder. Then, around 1955, just as Blue Note was hitting its stride, Wolff met a 28-year-old designer named Reid Miles. Miles had recently moved to New York and had been working for John Hermansader at Esquire magazine. He was a big fan of classical music but wasn’t so interested in jazz. Wolff convinced Miles to start designing covers for Blue Note all the same and kicked off one of the most influential partnerships in modern design. The first cover Miles created was for vibraphone player Milt Jackson; it picked up from the established art style, with Wolff’s photos and a single bright hue. But the type was even more exaggerated, and the photo took up more than half the cover. White dots overlayed on Jackson’s mallets were the perfect abstraction of the staccato tones of the vibraphone. It’s a great cover, but it was just a hint of what was to come. Reid Miles' cover for Milt Jackson via Ariel Salminen A common theme of Miles’ covers was the emphasis on Wolff’s photography. We’re familiar with these iconic images today, but at the time they were revolutionary; before, black musicians like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald were portrayed in tuxedos and evening gowns, posed smiling genially or laughing, rendered so as to not offend the largely white listening audience. Wolff’s portraits were candid, realistic, showing black musicians at work. For example, the cover for Art Blakey’s The Freedom Rider shows Blakey lost in a moment, almost entirely obscured by a cymbal. The drummer is smoking a cigarette, but it’s barely hanging onto the corner of his lip — his mouth is half-open, his brows clenched in a moment of agony or ecstasy. Miles would let the photo fill up the entire cover, cramming the name of the record into whatever empty space was available. Reid Miles' cover for Art Blakey's The Freedom Rider via London Jazz Collector Miles sometimes reversed this relationship, pioneering the use of typography to convey the spirit of the music. His cover for Jackie McLean’s It’s Time! is composed of an edge-to-edge grid of 243 exclamation marks; a postage stamp picture of McLean graces the upper corner, almost a punchline. Lee Morgan’s The Rumproller is another type-only cover, this time with the title smeared out from corner to corner, like it was left on a hot dashboard for the day. Larry Young’s Unity has no photo at all; the four members of the quartet become orange dots resting in (or bubbling out of) the bowl of the U.\n\nReid Miles' cover for Jackie McLean's It's Time via Ariel Salminen Reid Miles' cover for Lee Morgan's The Rumproller via Fonts in Use Reid Miles' cover for Larry Young's Unity\n\nMiles fulfilled the Blue Note manifesto. His album covers pushed the envelope of graphic design just as the artists on the records inside continued to break new ground in jazz. With the partnership of Miles and Wolff, alongside Alfred Lion’s commitment to artistic integrity, Blue Note became the standard-bearer for jazz. Columbia Records couldn’t help but notice. Even though Blue Note wasn’t nearly as commercially successful as Columbia, their willingness to take risks had established them as a much more sophisticated, innovative, and creative label; to compete for the best talent, Columbia would need to find a way to win the attention of both artists and listeners. The master: S. Neil Fujita Sadamitsu Fujita was born in 1921 in Waimea, Hawaii. He was assigned the name Neil in boarding school — leading up to World War II, anti-Japanese sentiment was rampant, especially in Hawaii. Fujita moved to LA to attend art school, but his studies were cut short in 1942 when Franklin Roosevelt signed executive order 9066, allowing the imprisonment of Japanese Americans living on the west coast. Fujita was sent to Wyoming, where he enlisted in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Before the war was over, he’d see combat in Italy, France, and the Pacific theater. After the war, Fujita finished his studies in LA. He quickly made a name for himself in the advertising world; his résumé landed on the desk of Bill Golden, the art director for CBS, which owned Columbia Records. Alex Steinweiss, the first album artist and Columbia’s ace in the hole, had moved on to RCA. Columbia needed a new direction. Golden called Fujita and asked him to run the art department. Fujita would be building a whole new team, replacing the relationships that Columbia had built with art studios for hire. This wasn’t going to be the hardest part of Fujita’s work; when offering him the job, Golden warned him that he’d experience a lot of racist attitudes still simmering in the wake of World War II. Still, Fujita agreed to take the job. Fujita’s first covers fit in with the work that Reid Miles was doing at Blue Note: single-color accents set against black-and-white photography.\n\nFujita's cover for The Jazz Messengers via Discogs Fujita's cover for Miles Davis' 'Round About Midnight via Discogs\n\nIn 1959, jazz was leaving the stratosphere. Ornette Coleman was performing what he called “free jazz,” frenetic, inscrutable compositions that drew backlash and praise in equal parts. John Coltrane recorded Giant Steps with a level of virtuosity that even his own bandmates struggled to keep up with. Miles Davis recorded Kind of Blue, which would go on to be regarded as one of the best recordings of all time. Fujita was also breaking ground at Columbia. He was one of the first directors to hire both men and women in a racially integrated office. He delegated work, tapping painters, illustrators, and photographers to contribute to covers. Fujita himself trained to be a painter before starting his career in design; he started looking for ways to incorporate his own original paintings into the covers: “We thought about what the picture was saying about the music,” Fujita recalled, “and how we could use that to sell the record. And abstract art was getting popular so we used a lot more abstraction in the designs—with jazz records especially.” He got the perfect opportunity to make his mark with two albums released in 1959: Charles Mingus’s Mingus Ah Um and Dave Brubeck’s Time Out.\n\nFujita's cover for Charles Mingus' Mingus Ah Um Fujita's cover for Dave Brubeck's Time Out\n\nFujita’s abstract paintings reflected the pure exuberance of Mingus’ and Brubeck’s music. In the case of Mingus Ah Um, the divisions and intersections spanning the cover read like a beam of light passing through exotic lenses, magnifiers, refractors, and prisms; through his music, Mingus was reflecting on the transition of jazz from popular entertainment to mind-expanding creative exercise. For Time Out, the wheels and rollers spooling out across the page echo the way that Brubeck’s quartet was experimenting with how time signatures could be interlocked, multiplied, and divided to create completely new textures and musical patterns. Fujita’s covers made it plain: Jazz was art. ’59 turned out to be a watershed for both jazz and album art. Brubeck’s Time Out went to #2 on the pop charts in 1961, and was the first jazz LP to sell more than a million copies; “Take Five,” the album’s standout hit, would also become the first jazz single to sell a million copies. For a unique moment in time, the music and art worlds were being propelled forward by a commercially successful record. Fujita’s paintings were making their way into millions of homes, driving sales of records by the vanguards of jazz. Fujita left Columbia records shortly after these major successes. “I wanted to be something other than just a record designer,” he said, “so I left to go on my own.” He’d go on to design the book covers for Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood and Mario Puzo’s The Godfather — when the latter was turned into Francis Coppola’s breakthrough film, Fujita’s design was used for its title and promotional art. But he’d continue to design album covers, creating paintings for each one.\n\nFujita's cover for Johnny Eaton's Far Out, Near In Fujita's cover for Dony Byrd and Gigi Gryce's Modern Jazz Perspective Fujita's cover for Columbia's recording of Glenn Gould performing Berg, Křenek, and Schoenberg.\n\nThe next generation As jazz continued to evolve throughout the ’60s and ’70s, melding with rock ’n roll to produce punk, electronic, R&B, and rap, album art evolved alongside. Packaging became more sophisticated: multi-disc albums came in folding cases called gatefolds, accompanied by booklets of photography and art. New printing techniques allowed for brighter colors, shiny foil stamps, and textured finishes. Budgets for production grew larger and larger. The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band featured an elaborate photo of the band members, 57 life-sized photograph cutouts, and nine wax sculptures. For the first time for a rock EP, the lyrics to the songs were printed on the back of the cover. In another first, the paper sleeve inside was not white but a colorful abstract pattern instead.

Now it’s been rebuilt in LEGO as well, courtesy of Lasse Vestergård. Unlike the original, Lasse’s version isn’t just gilded but uses pearl gold bricks. With a limited range of elements in that color, the builder had to find creative solutions and work with small 1×1 and 1×2 plates to build the large structure. (Lasse has some experience with golden temples!) The temple looks incredible as it sits at an angle on a placid lake surrounded by gardens. I appreciate the brick-built hills in the distance, keeping every element on screen made from LEGO.\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve featured a MOC of Kinkaku-ji. 18 years ago we presented a version by Japanese LEGO legend Jumpei Mitsui.\n\nRelated"}

It updates the 2008 Public Access Policy, which allowed for a 12-month delay before research articles were required to be made publicly available. The 2024 policy removed the embargo period so that researchers, students and members of the public have rapid access to these findings, according to the announcement.\n\nNIH director Jay Bhattacharya, who took over last month, said the move is aimed at continuing “to promote maximum transparency” and rebuilding public confidence in scientists, which has waned in recent years.\n\n“Earlier implementation of the Public Access Policy will help increase public confidence in the research we fund while also ensuring that the investments made by taxpayers produce replicable, reproducible, and generalizable results that benefit all Americans,” Bhattacharya said in the memo. “Providing speedy public access to NIH-funded results is just one of the ways we are working to earn back the trust of the American people.”\n\nAlthough the scientific research community is supportive of the policy itself, some are calling on the NIH to reinstate the original implementation date to give researchers time to effectively comply with this and other new agency regulations.\n\n“This new effective date will impose extra burdens on researchers and their institutions to meet the deadline,” Matt Owens, president of COGR, which represents research institutions, said in a statement Wednesday. “Ironically, at the same time NIH is accelerating implementation of this policy, the agency is adding new burdensome certification and financial reporting requirements for grant recipients. This runs counter to the administration’s efforts to reduce regulations.”"}

It’s as scary as you think", "fullContent": "On the top floor of San Francisco’s Moscone convention center, I’m sitting in one row of many chairs, most already full. It’s the start of a day at the RSAC’s annual cybersecurity conference, and still early in the week. When the presenters take the stage, their attitude is briskly professional but energetic.\n\nI’m expecting a technical dive into standard AI tools—something that gives an up-close look at how ChatGPT and its rivals are manipulated for dirty deeds. Sherri Davidoff, Founder and CEO of LMG Security, reinforces this belief with her opener about software vulnerabilities and exploits.\n\nBut then Matt Durrin, Director of Training and Research at LMG Security, drops an unexpected phrase: “Evil AI.”\n\nCue a soft record scratch in my head.\n\n“What if hackers can use their evil AI tools that don’t have guardrails to find vulnerabilities before we have a chance to fix them?” Durrin says. “[We’re] going to show you examples.”\n\nAnd not just screenshots, though as the presentation continues, plenty of those illustrate the points made by the LMG Security team. I’m about to see live demos, too, of one evil AI in particular—WormGPT.\n\nThe WormGPT website. LMG Security / RSAC Conference\n\nDavidoff and Durrin start with a chronological overview of their attempts to gain access to rogue AI. The story ends up revealing a thread of normalcy behind what most people think of as dark, shadowy corners of the internet. In some ways, the session feels like a glimpse into a mirror universe.\n\nDurrin first describes a couple of unsuccessful attempts to access an evil AI. The creator of “Ghost GPT” ghosted them after receiving payment for the tool. A conversation with DevilGPT’s developer made Durrin uneasy enough to pass on the opportunity.\n\nWhat have we learned so far? Most of these dark AI tools have “GPT” somewhere in their name to lean on the brand strength of ChatGPT.\n\nThe third option Durrin mentions bore fruit, though. After hearing about WormGPT in a 2023 Brian Krebs article, the team dove back into Telegram’s channels to find it—and successfully got their hands on it for just $50.\n\n“It is a very, very useful tool if you’re looking at performing something evil,” says Durrin. “[It’s] ChatGPT, but with no safety rails in place.” Want to ask it anything? You truly can, even if it’s destructive or harmful.\n\nThat info isn’t too unsettling yet, though. The proof is in what this AI can do.\n\nWormGPT draws strong distinctions between it and ChatGPT. LMG Security\n\nDurrin and Davidoff start by walking us through their experience with an older version of WormGPT from 2024. They first tossed the source code for DotProject, an open-source project management platform. It correctly identified a SQL vulnerability and even suggested a basic exploit for it—which didn’t work. Turns out, this older form of WormGPT couldn’t capitalize on the weaknesses it spotted, likely due to its inability to ingest the full set of source code.\n\nNot good, but not spooky.\n\nNext, the LMG Security team ramped up the difficulty with the Log4j vulnerability, setting up an exploitable server. This version of WormGPT, which was a bit newer, found the remote execution vulnerability present—another success. But again, it fell short on its explanation of how to exploit, at least for a beginner hacker. Davidoff says “an intermediate hacker” could work with this level of information.\n\nNot great, but a knowledge barrier still exists.\n\nNewer versions of WormGPT can explain to novice hackers how exactly to pwn a server with a Log4j vulnerability. LMG Security / RSAC Conference\n\nBut another, newer iteration of WormGPT? It gave detailed, explicit directions for how to exploit the vulnerability and even generated code incorporating the sample server’s IP address. And those instructions worked.\n\nOkay, that’s…bad?\n\nFinally, the team decided to give the latest version of WormGPT a harder task. Its updates blow away much of the early variant’s limitations—you can now feed it an unlimited amount of code, for starters. This time, LMG Security simulated a vulnerable e-commerce platform (Magento), seeing if WormGPT could find the two-part exploit.\n\nIt did. But tools from the good guys didn’t.\n\nSonarQube, an open-source platform that looks for flaws in code, only caught one potential vulnerability… but it was unrelated to the issue that the team was testing for. ChatGPT didn’t catch it, either.\n\nOn top of this, WormGPT can give a full rundown of how to hack a vulnerable Magento server, with explanations for each step, and quickly too, as I see during the live demo. The exploit is even offered unprompted.\n\nAs Davidoff says, “I’m a little nervous to see where we’re going to be with hacker AI tools in another six months, because you can just see the progress that’s been made right now over the past year.”\n\nLMG Security’s recap of where AI hacker tools started, where they are now, and what we’re facing for the future. LMG Security / RSAC Conference\n\nThe experts here are far calmer than I am. I’m remembering something Davidoff said at the beginning of the session: “We are actually in the very early infant stages of [hacker AI].”\n\nWell, f***.\n\nThis moment is when I realize that as a purpose-built tool, WormGPT and similar rogue AIs have a head start in both sniffing out and capitalizing on code weaknesses. Plus, they lower the bar for getting into successful hacking. Now, as long as you have money for a subscription, you’re in the game.\n\nOn the other side, I start wondering how constrained the good guys are by their ethics—and their general mindset. The general talk around AI is about the betterment of society and humanity, rather than how to protect against the worst of humanity. As Davidoff pointed out during the session, AI should be used to help vet code, to help catch vulnerabilities before dark AI does.\n\nThis situation is a problem for us end users. We are the soft, squishy masses; we still pay (sometimes literally) if the systems we rely on daily aren’t well-defended. We have to deal with the messy aftermath of scams, compromised credit cards, malware, and such.\n\nOur Favorite Password Manager Dashlane Read our review Best Prices Today:\n\nThe only silver lining in all this? Those in the shadows typically don’t look too hard at anyone else there with them. Cybersecurity experts should be able to still research and analyze these hacker AI tools and ultimately improve their own methodologies.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you and I have to focus on how to minimize splash damage whenever a service, platform, or site becomes compromised. Right now it takes many different tricks—passkeys and unique, strong passwords to protect accounts (and password managers to store them all); two-factor authentication; email masks to hide our real email addresses; reliable antivirus on our PCs; a VPN to ensure privacy on open or otherwise unsecure networks; temporary credit card numbers (if available to you through your bank); credit freezes; and yet still more.\n\nIt’s a pain in the butt, but unfortunately so necessary. And it seems like that’s only going to become truer, for now."}

Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.).\n\n“The Republicans should start to think about expelling them from Congress for all of the crimes that they have committed, especially around Election time(s). These are very dishonest people that won’t let our Country heal,” Trump said.\n\n“Why do we allow them to continuously use Impeachment as a weapon against the President of the United States who, by all accounts, is working hard to SAVE OUR COUNTRY. It’s the same playbook that they used in my First Term, and Republicans are not going to allow them to get away with it again.”\n\n“These are total LOWLIFES, who hate our Country, and everything it stands for. Perhaps we should start playing this game on them, and expel Democrats for the many crimes that they have committed — And these are REAL crimes,” he continued.\n\nRep. Shri Thanedar announced Monday that he had filed seven articles of impeachment against Trump actions including the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\nEarlier this week, three other House Democrats quietly withdrew their names from the list of co-sponsors on Thanedar’s impeachment resolution after reportedly finding out the filing hadn’t been approved by party bigwigs.\n\nReps. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) and Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.) each went to the House floor to request removal of their names, each of which was granted by the House clerk, the Hill reported.\n\n“Congressman Mfume removed himself as a cosponsor from H. Res. 353 because he was made aware it was not cleared by Democratic leadership and not fully vetted legally — and he preferred to err on the side of caution,” an Mfume spokesperson said.\n\n“The Congresswoman was under the impression that the resolution was drafted and reviewed by both the House Judiciary Committee and Leadership when she originally signed on during a vote series on the floor,” a rep for Kelly added.\n\nNadler’s office, meanwhile, didn’t respond to The Post’s request for comment."}

The 23-year-old Georgian international has quietly built a reputation in La Liga and arrives at Anfield as one of Europe’s most promising young stoppers.\n\nDespite Valencia enduring a turbulent campaign, their shot-stopper remained a bright light. James Pearce reports for The Athletic that “he has been pivotal in a recent upturn that has seen Valencia go eight games unbeaten, conceding just five in their last seven matches.” That kind of consistency and composure under pressure makes Mamardashvili an exciting acquisition.\n\nHe is not coming in to challenge Alisson Becker just yet—but the roadmap is clear.\n\nAlisson Reaffirms His Loyalty to Liverpool\n\nAs speculation circled regarding Saudi Pro League interest last summer, Liverpool fans may have briefly worried about the future of their Brazilian No 1. But Alisson’s camp was quick to pour cold water on those rumours. Goalkeeping coach Claudio Taffarel told ESPN Brazil:\n\n“He wants to continue living this story. I saw that this wave of Saudi Arabia came with great opportunities, very high offers, but he always says: ‘I want to continue this story because I owe a lot to them here, and I want to continue this life here’.”\n\nAlisson remains central to Liverpool’s plans, with a contract that runs until at least 2026, with the club holding an option to extend by a further year. His recent performances during the title run-in, especially after returning from injury, showed exactly why Liverpool remain so committed to him.\n\nKelleher’s Future Points Elsewhere\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher, meanwhile, looks set to leave this summer. The Republic of Ireland international has long made clear his ambition to become a first-choice goalkeeper elsewhere. Pearce writes, “Liverpool rejected a bid from Nottingham Forest in January and Bournemouth are among his suitors.”\n\nValued around £30 million, Kelleher is expected to fetch a significant fee. His contributions this season have been vital, stepping in with maturity and confidence whenever Alisson was sidelined. Internally, Liverpool staff see him as one of the unsung heroes of their Premier League-winning campaign.\n\nIt’s bittersweet for supporters, as Kelleher has become a well-liked figure both on and off the pitch, but few can begrudge him the opportunity to spread his wings.\n\nJaros Faces Crucial Summer Decision\n\nAttention now turns to Vitezslav Jaros, who made his Premier League debut in October against Crystal Palace. Liverpool must decide whether to send him out on loan or keep him as third-choice behind Alisson and Mamardashvili. The 23-year-old has impressed in training and brief appearances, and his future could hinge on how pre-season unfolds.\n\nWith Liverpool now balancing short-term silverware goals under Arne Slot with long-term squad development, the Jaros decision will be a litmus test of the club’s confidence in their next generation.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs Liverpool fans, we’ve learned to spot the signs of smart planning—and this is it.\n\nMamardashvili’s arrival is the kind of forward-thinking business that successful clubs get right. At 6’6”, he’s an imposing figure with quick reflexes and the composure you want in big matches. More importantly, his signing doesn’t just plug a gap—it builds for the future while respecting the present.\n\nAlisson staying? That’s huge. You don’t win titles without a top-class goalkeeper, and we all saw how much his presence was missed during those 10 games he sat out. Taffarel’s quote was reassuring—it’s clear Alisson feels this club as much as we do. That kind of emotional buy-in is rare in modern football.\n\nAs for Kelleher, we owe him massive gratitude. He’s been there during cup runs, stepped up in pressure games, and never looked out of place. While it hurts to see him go, he deserves his shot at being No 1. We’ll be cheering him wherever he ends up—unless it’s against us, of course!\n\nAnd don’t sleep on Jaros. If the club decides he’s ready, he could quietly become a very important figure next season, especially with so many competitions demanding squad depth.\n\nWith Arne Slot having just delivered a title in his debut season, Liverpool’s foundation looks stronger than ever. From front to back, this team is preparing to dominate—not just for a season, but for a generation."}

James Pearce’s recent article for The Athletic outlines how Liverpool’s previous concerns over the No 6 position have now eased, thanks in part to the emergence of Ryan Gravenberch in a deeper role.\n\n“Gravenberch’s impact in the deeper No 6 role means that signing another holding midfielder is no longer a priority,” writes Pearce, reflecting a change in strategy. While Liverpool previously considered Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller after failing to land Martin Zubimendi last summer, they ultimately decided to move forward with existing options. That decision now appears to be paying off.\n\nSlot’s tactical flexibility and trust in youth has reshaped the narrative. Where once there was urgency to reinforce, now there’s a calculated calm—a sign of a club whose planning is aligning with performance.\n\nEndo’s Utility and Experience Still Valued\n\nWataru Endo may not be making headlines weekly, but his contribution remains appreciated. Though he’s only played 157 minutes in the Premier League this season, Endo’s role in helping close out games is seen as vital.\n\n“Getting sufficient game time before the 2026 World Cup is a consideration for Endo but he is happy and settled at Liverpool,” Pearce notes. The Japan captain’s professionalism, versatility and leadership offer intangible benefits that go beyond minutes on the pitch.\n\nWith his contract running until 2027, Endo is seen more as a specialist tool in Slot’s tactical arsenal—trusted to deliver control in high-stakes moments, especially late in matches.\n\nBajcetic’s Revival at Las Palmas Signals Hope\n\nAnother notable update is on 20-year-old Stefan Bajcetic, whose move from Red Bull Salzburg to Las Palmas in January has helped reinvigorate his development. Injuries had previously hindered his momentum, but now he’s gaining regular minutes in La Liga.\n\n“The plan is to assess young Spanish midfielder Stefan Bajcetic when he returns to Kirkby for pre-season,” says Pearce, and there’s a genuine hope he could yet provide a long-term solution in the deeper midfield roles. Slot is known for trusting young players, and Bajcetic, with his calmness in possession and positional intelligence, fits that profile perfectly.\n\nMorton’s Likely Departure Highlights Academy’s Transition Phase\n\nWhile the focus is on retention and integration for some, others are preparing to move on. Tyler Morton, who has recovered from shoulder surgery, is expected to be sold this summer. The 22-year-old, valued at around £20m, has shown promise in loan spells but now faces a crossroads.\n\nLiverpool’s midfield rebuild post-Klopp has been about more than just new signings; it’s also about managing transitions, ensuring talents like Morton are given the right environment to flourish—even if that means away from Anfield.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThere’s a quiet confidence underpinning Liverpool’s midfield strategy right now—an almost un-Kloppian calmness in the lack of transfer urgency. Slot, fresh off delivering a Premier League title in his debut season, is clearly backing his current crop, and that speaks volumes.\n\nEndo’s role remains understated but crucial. He may not be flashy, but in big moments—when games get tight—his composure and tactical awareness are assets. Having a player content with that supporting role, yet capable of influencing results, is a luxury.\n\nGravenberch’s deeper deployment is perhaps the most intriguing development. Many saw him as a roaming No 8, but his ability to anchor the midfield is giving Liverpool a new dimension. It’s a reminder that player development isn’t linear and that under the right manager, roles evolve.\n\nThe Bajcetic story is one fans should get excited about. Las Palmas might not draw headlines, but regular La Liga football has sharpened his instincts and decision-making. Slot’s willingness to reintegrate him this summer shows just how valued he is internally.\n\nMorton’s likely sale is bittersweet. Another Scouser who won’t quite make the leap to first-team regular, but his valuation speaks to Liverpool’s ability to nurture assets. £20m for a player with limited Premier League exposure is a testament to smart development.\n\nThis is what sustainable squad management looks like: no panic buys, measured evaluation of youth, and a long-term view. With a Premier League crown already secured, the next chapter under Slot looks to be as well-constructed as it is ambitious."}

Despite recent speculation linking the 22-year-old centre-back with a £30 million move—rumours which have included prior interest from Newcastle United—the club is making it clear he is a vital part of their plans moving forward.\n\nJames Pearce of The Athletic reports that senior Liverpool sources have “emphatically dismissed talk of a possible £30m price tag” and stressed that only a “very big offer” might cause them to reconsider. That is not the language of a club willing to entertain discussions lightly. It’s a firm line being drawn under the future of one of the brightest young defenders in the Premier League.\n\nThis stance comes at a critical time as Arne Slot, fresh off delivering a long-awaited Premier League title in his first season, begins to shape his long-term squad vision. With uncertainty surrounding Ibrahima Konaté’s contract and interest in Dean Huijsen heating up, Quansah’s role becomes even more pivotal.\n\nHuijsen on Radar, but Chelsea Lead Chase\n\nLiverpool are actively monitoring Dean Huijsen, the 20-year-old Spain international who impressed after joining Bournemouth last summer for £12 million. He has a £50 million release clause and boasts a skill set well-suited to Slot’s tactical demands—ball-playing composure, aerial strength, and the intelligence to read the game early.\n\nYet, as Pearce notes, “Liverpool currently regard Chelsea as the front-runners”, with strong competition from domestic and European clubs. This doesn’t mean Liverpool are backing off, but they may have to act decisively if Konaté’s contract stalemate continues to drag on.\n\nKonaté Contract Clouds Decision-Making\n\nIbrahima Konaté’s future adds further complexity. With his contract entering its final year and no extension in sight, Liverpool must balance loyalty, squad planning, and financial prudence. Pearce quotes the player directly amid title celebrations: “This is a conversation with the club and we will see.”\n\nIt’s a situation the Reds have encountered before. Pearce reminds us of the £150 million bid for Mo Salah from Al Ittihad in 2023 that was rejected, with Liverpool choosing to prioritise the player’s impact over the bottom line. A similar approach may emerge here, but with one crucial caveat: letting Konaté walk for free in 2026 is not an option.\n\nSlot’s Defensive Blueprint: Balance of Youth and Experience\n\nSlot will want stability at the back as he aims to build on a phenomenal debut season. That makes retaining Quansah even more important. He’s versatile, calm under pressure, and homegrown—crucial qualities in a squad where defensive options could soon be in flux.\n\nQuansah’s rise through the ranks has been timely. With Virgil van Dijk entering the twilight of his career and Joe Gomez often deployed at full-back, keeping a progressive talent like Quansah becomes less about rejecting offers and more about building around him.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a fan’s perspective, this feels like smart squad management. Quansah isn’t just promising; he’s already proven he can handle the pressure of elite-level football. To even entertain selling him for £30 million would be short-sighted. In this market, that fee barely gets you a solid Championship defender, let alone an England U21 international who looks comfortable at Anfield.\n\nIt’s clear that Liverpool are learning from past mistakes. In previous years, we might’ve seen the club cash in early on rising stars. But under Slot’s guidance—and with the backing of a confident recruitment strategy—Quansah looks set to become a central figure for years to come.\n\nThe interest in Huijsen is intriguing. He’s technically superb and would add depth, but it should never come at the cost of unsettling Quansah. Signing both Konaté and Huijsen to new deals while keeping Quansah should be the goal. If Konaté does not commit, the club must pivot decisively and reinforce accordingly.\n\nAs for the Konaté situation, the club need clarity soon. Fans respect him, but dragging it out risks destabilising the back line at a crucial moment. We’ve got momentum now; let’s not lose it through indecision.\n\nIn short, Liverpool’s current stance on Quansah is not only correct—it’s essential. Selling him now would be regression dressed as business. Slot’s era is just beginning, and Jarell Quansah deserves to be a part of it."}

While the trophy is already in the bag, Arne Slot’s side still have tangible milestones within reach – not least the opportunity to surpass the club’s Premier League points record and reinforce their status as England’s dominant force.\n\nSunday’s fixture will also see a potentially welcome sight for Liverpool supporters: the return of Conor Bradley to the matchday squad.\n\nConor Bradley’s Return Adds Depth to Liverpool Defence\n\nThe 21-year-old Northern Irishman has enjoyed a breakthrough campaign under Slot, offering energy and versatility on the right flank in the absence of Trent Alexander-Arnold. Yet, his progress has not come without setbacks. A hamstring tear in February kept him sidelined for over a month, and his recent knock in training saw him miss Liverpool’s 5-1 dismantling of Tottenham Hotspur – the match that mathematically sealed the club’s 20th English league title, bringing them level with Manchester United.\n\nNow, Slot has provided a timely update ahead of the Chelsea encounter.\n\n“He will train today, we expect him to be available, doesn’t mean he will start but if all goes well over the weekend, he will be in the squad,” said the Liverpool manager during his pre-match press conference.\n\nThat measured optimism encapsulates Slot’s approach since arriving at Anfield. There’s trust in youth, but never recklessness. Bradley’s contributions this season – particularly in high-pressure moments – have not gone unnoticed, but with Alexander-Arnold back to full fitness, rotation and caution are the watchwords.\n\nChelsea Face do-or-die Scenario as Liverpool Play with Freedom\n\nChelsea, meanwhile, find themselves in an altogether different scenario. Hovering just outside the top four, their need for points is desperate. While Liverpool can afford to be pragmatic with squad selection, Mauricio Pochettino must go full throttle. It’s a stark contrast that may work in the Reds’ favour.\n\nSlot, fresh off his Premier League triumph in his debut season, has preached consistency without conservatism. With the title wrapped up, he has the luxury of fine-tuning the squad and giving opportunities to emerging players like Bradley, while still maintaining high performance levels – especially with records and legacy still at stake.\n\nSlot’s Pragmatism Underpins Liverpool’s Dominance\n\nIt would be easy to forget that this is Arne Slot’s first season in English football. To arrive in the wake of Jürgen Klopp – a transformative figure – and immediately deliver silverware is no small feat. But Slot’s impact goes beyond results.\n\nBradley’s development is one example of how the Dutchman has instilled tactical clarity while promoting young talent. The right-back’s ability to slot seamlessly into Liverpool’s high-tempo, possession-based game suggests he’s not just a promising understudy, but a legitimate contender for a long-term starting role.\n\nLiverpool’s transformation this season has hinged on depth, adaptability, and clarity of purpose. Whether or not Bradley starts at Stamford Bridge, his availability provides further tactical flexibility for Slot – and yet another reminder of how Liverpool have mastered the art of squad building under their new boss.\n\nAs the Reds head into their final matches with the title secured, the focus shifts to sustaining momentum, protecting fitness, and perhaps most crucially, setting the tone for next season – with players like Conor Bradley firmly part of that vision."}

On The Daily Red Podcast, Dave Hendric… [+3472 chars]", "title": "Dave Hendrick Backs Morgan Rogers Move Amid Liverpool Squad Concerns", "fullContent": "Liverpool’s Summer Focus: Morgan Rogers Emerges as Priority Target\n\nRight Back Conundrum Requires Urgent Action\n\nLiverpool may be Premier League champions, but cracks remain in the squad—none more so than the right-back position. On The Daily Red Podcast, Dave Hendrick raised strong concerns about Connor Bradley’s durability: “I’m not saying Connor Bradley is injury-prone, but the fella has missed more games than he’s played for us.” While Bradley’s potential isn’t dismissed, Hendrick warned that recurring back, ankle and hamstring problems are “very concerning” for a player expected to be explosive in 1v1 situations.\n\nThe need for a new right-back is, in Hendrick’s words, “absolutely negligent work from Richard Hughes and co” if ignored. Suggestions that Jarell Quansah or Joe Gomez could fill in are dismissed: “Quansah can’t play there, he can stand out there, he can’t play there.” With uncertainty over Gomez’s future, Liverpool simply “need to buy a right-back this summer.”\n\nMorgan Rogers: Perfect Fit for Slot’s System\n\nShifting to Liverpool’s attacking future, Hendrick gave a glowing endorsement of Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers, whose name has recently emerged via transfer reporter Fabrizio Romano. Despite complications around a potential deal—given Villa’s financial juggling under PSR constraints—Hendrick sees a deal as a no-brainer: “Morgan Rogers would be an incredible signing for us.”\n\nHendrick linked the 21-year-old directly to Arne Slot’s tactical style, referencing Slot’s use of a “wing-10 hybrid type” role at Feyenoord: “Rogers is tailor-made for that role… He can also fill in at the 10.” That versatility adds further appeal, allowing Liverpool to rotate between Cody Gakpo, Dominik Szoboszlai, and Rogers himself, depending on the fixture demands.\n\nSquad Reshuffle: Outgoings to Fund the Future\n\nHendrick didn’t shy away from bold suggestions on reshaping the squad. He proposed a scenario in which Luis Díaz and Harvey Elliott are sold to raise funds for Rogers and the promotion of youngsters like Trey Nyoni and Rio Ngumoha: “Does anyone really think we’d be worse off by swapping out Luis Diaz and Harvey Elliott for Morgan Rogers, Rio and Trey? I just don’t see that we could possibly be any worse off.”\n\nIn Hendrick’s view, the additions would strengthen the squad now and lay a foundation for years to come. “You’re much better off for now and for the future… that could be a core group in place for the next three to four years.”\n\nNo Room for Sentiment in Future Planning\n\nHendrick made clear that reputation or past performance won’t factor into his vision of Liverpool’s next chapter. Harvey Elliott’s Premier League minutes this season were noted as minimal: “He doesn’t play. He just doesn’t play… less than 200 minutes in the Premier League.” As such, the idea of needing to replace him if sold is dismissed out of hand.\n\nSimilarly, he was blunt in evaluating Stefan Bajčetić’s loan spell in Spain, dismissing talk of “rave reviews” as Liverpool fan myth-making. “He hasn’t been particularly good with Las Palmas… his passing numbers are atrocious… there’s clearly talent there, but the idea of him as a Liverpool player right now is just wild.”\n\nFinal Thought: Rogers and Wharton as Cornerstones\n\nThe standout quote summarising Hendrick’s stance on the club’s summer ambition is emphatic: “If Morgan Rogers is gettable, we should do everything we can to get him. Him and Adam Wharton are two we should absolutely be going all in for.” For Hendrick, these are not just smart signings—they are the seeds of Liverpool’s next great team."}

One of the key questions to be resolved this summer is the centre-back conundrum, with fresh links to Bournemouth defender Dean Huijsen, and uncertainty surrounding Ibrahima Konaté’s future.\n\nHuijsen Interest Highlights Slot’s Long-Term Vision\n\nAccording to a detailed report by James Pearce for The Athletic, Liverpool are firmly in the race to sign 20-year-old centre-back Dean Huijsen, who has impressed during his first season at AFC Bournemouth. Huijsen is a composed ball-playing defender, known for his ability to carry the ball out from the back — a key trait in Slot’s high-possession, progressive system.\n\nHuijsen, a Spain international, has a £50 million release clause, and interest in him is widespread. Chelsea are reportedly leading the chase at this stage, but Liverpool remain in close contact and view him as an ideal profile to thrive under Slot’s guidance.\n\nHis signing would represent a forward-thinking move, fitting the club’s recent approach of investing in youth with high potential — much like the acquisitions of Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister last summer.\n\nKonaté Uncertainty Fuels Transfer Momentum\n\nWhat complicates the club’s thinking is the contract situation of Ibrahima Konaté. The Frenchman’s deal is running into its final year, and while both parties have expressed a willingness to continue, negotiations are ‘some way off’.\n\n“This is a conversation with the club and we will see,” Konaté said during the title celebrations, leaving fans and executives alike in suspense.\n\nThere’s no panic yet, but the club face a dilemma. If the impasse continues through next season, they risk losing a valuable asset for nothing in 2026. Liverpool will prioritise squad stability and performance, much as they did when they rejected Al Ittihad’s £150 million bid for Mohamed Salah in 2023, valuing team cohesion above a tempting windfall.\n\nSlot’s Stamp Begins to Show\n\nSlot’s immediate success has already won over many at Anfield, but the Dutchman is now entering the phase of building a team in his own image. Signing Huijsen would be a signal of that — moving away from reactive defending and towards a system that controls games from the back.\n\nLiverpool fans will remember past windows where promising targets slipped through the net. With Chelsea reportedly ahead, the next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether the Reds can assert themselves in the transfer market as confidently as they have on the pitch.\n\nBalancing Act Between Risk and Reinforcement\n\nWhile it’s unlikely Liverpool will invest heavily across multiple areas this summer, centre-back is now a live priority. With Joe Gomez also potentially departing, Virgil van Dijk aging, and Ibrahima Konate yet to agree a new contract, strengthening this position is no longer optional.\n\nWhether Konaté stays or not, adding someone like Huijsen would provide depth and future-proofing — essential if Slot is to keep Liverpool at the summit.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a supporter’s perspective, this report is both exciting and unsettling. On one hand, the idea of bringing in Dean Huijsen — a highly-rated young defender with elite pedigree — fits exactly the kind of smart business Liverpool should be doing. He’s young, already international level, and reportedly well-suited to Slot’s progressive approach.\n\nBut there’s a nagging concern. If Chelsea are truly ahead, why haven’t Liverpool acted faster? We’ve seen this story before: dithering over price tags, letting rivals swoop in. The longer Konaté’s contract situation lingers, the more it feels like we’re walking into another defensive transition without clarity.

Fresh off a season that… [+3915 chars]", "title": "“I Still Believe” – Andy Robertson Speaks out on Liverpool Future and Reacts to Milos Kerkez Links", "fullContent": "Andy Robertson Eyeing Liverpool Future as Premier League Era Under Slot Begins\n\nAndy Robertson has made clear his intentions: he wants to remain a Liverpool player beyond 2026, and he believes he still has the ability to perform at the very highest level. Fresh off a season that culminated in a Premier League title—the club’s 20th overall and the first under new manager Arne Slot—the Scotland captain says he’s far from finished.\n\nSpeaking during a candid chat with Jamie Carragher at a Football For Change charity event in Liverpool, Robertson offered a glimpse into both his personal ambitions and his views on the club’s direction after a landmark campaign.\n\nContract Talks on the Horizon\n\nWith just over a year left on his current deal, Robertson hasn’t hidden his desire to stay. “I have only got a year left,” he said. “So I hope all you guys (the fans) can help me with making the same noise around a new contract as you did with Mo and Virgil’s! Maybe you (Carragher) can stop linking the club with other left-backs as well!”\n\nHis message—part serious, part tongue-in-cheek—is clear: he believes he’s still playing at a level worthy of Liverpool Football Club. And the numbers support his claim. Despite a season disrupted at times by injuries and squad rotation, Robertson made 30 Premier League appearances and helped the Reds secure a league-high 14 clean sheets.\n\nRumours have linked Liverpool with a move for Bournemouth’s Milos Kerkez, a rising star and a decade younger than Robertson, but the veteran left-back isn’t fazed. His focus remains on performance and consistency. “I still believe I can still produce good performances and some really good performances… I still think I can produce at the top level and if I can do that then that is where I belong and hopefully I can stay here for many years to come.”\n\nSlot’s Champions Set Their Sights on Sustained Success\n\nLiverpool’s emphatic 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield sealed a dominant league campaign for Slot’s side—his first in charge following the departure of Jurgen Klopp in May 2024. For Robertson and the club’s experienced core, the triumph is validation and a motivation.\n\n“That is what we hope,” Robertson said, when asked if Liverpool could build a new era of dominance. “Our team under Jurgen was unbelievable at times… but we also believe that we should have had more.”\n\nHe references past near-misses and historic nights as fuel for the future. “We want to experience winning the Premier League with the fans. We want to have that moment.”\n\nThe title won in 2020—achieved during pandemic restrictions—was a unique triumph but one lacking the roar of the Kop. This season’s success will be celebrated properly, with an open-top bus parade and a full house at Anfield. “This time we will get a full house and the parade that we all deserve and I think that is what has been driving us forward.”\n\nTurning Points and Belief\n\nAsked to identify the moment belief truly set in among the squad, Robertson points to a hard-fought 2-0 win at Brentford in February—a match in which he and Darwin Nunez came off the bench to turn the tide.\n\n“You always have to have results where it looks like it is going one way and it goes another,” he said. “We obviously made two super subs on 60 minutes when me and Darwin came on… I am not sure I’ll get the credit that Darwin will!”\n\nThe late goals, combined with Arsenal’s draw against Aston Villa later that day, widened Liverpool’s lead and sparked a feeling of inevitability. “It just felt like walking off that pitch… now is the time to believe that we could do it and that was the start of a really good period for us.”\n\nLegacy, Leadership and Looking Ahead\n\nAs Liverpool prepare for the summer transfer window and life beyond their most recent title, Robertson stands as both a leader and a symbol of continuity. Alongside Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alisson Becker, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez, he’s part of a group that bridged the Klopp and Slot eras—and that isn’t lost on him.\n\n“We are all singing from the same hymn sheet,” Robertson said, with a nod to the unity that carried them to the top of English football once again.\n\nThe message is simple: don’t write him off yet."}

Yes, the visitors have already claimed the Premier League crown with that emphatic 5-1 demolition of Tottenham Hotspur. But don’t let the formalities fool you—this one matters. Not for Liverpool’s title parade, but for Chelsea’s Champions League hopes, which remain on a knife edge.\n\nLiverpool’s Title Won, but Professional Pride Remains\n\nArne Slot’s inaugural season in charge could hardly have gone better. A first campaign, a first title, and the promise of a bright new chapter post-Klopp. The Dutchman hasn’t just steadied the ship—he’s launched a fleet. And while Liverpool fans will have to wait until the final day to see their team lift the trophy, they can enjoy a lap of honour over these last four games.\n\nThe squad remains largely healthy, with Conor Bradley likely to return after a minor knock. Joe Gomez is still sidelined, but otherwise, the newly-crowned champions can field something close to a full-strength XI if they choose.\n\nChelsea’s Top-Four Hopes Hang in the Balance\n\nIn sharp contrast, for Chelsea, this is no end-of-term stroll. Enzo Maresca’s side find themselves locked in a tense battle for a Champions League berth, currently sitting fifth, level on points with Nottingham Forest. With just a handful of games left, three points at home are essential.\n\nWhile injuries have disrupted Maresca’s plans, there’s cautious optimism. Robert Sanchez and Christopher Nkunku both missed the midweek European trip with knocks, but the manager hinted these were precautionary. Malo Gusto will be assessed late after a thigh complaint, while Wesley Fofana, Marc Guiu, Omari Kellyman, and Mykhailo Mudryk remain sidelined.\n\nThis is a Chelsea side still in transition, yet to fully convince over a sustained period. But home advantage, urgency, and Liverpool’s potential complacency offer a rare opportunity—especially considering Chelsea haven’t beaten the Reds at Stamford Bridge since March 2020.\n\nPrediction and Tactical Outlook\n\nSlot may opt to experiment. With the title already secured, this could be a chance to hand minutes to fringe players and academy prospects—though Chelsea should beware underestimating Liverpool’s depth.\n\nMaresca’s game plan will likely hinge on controlling the midfield and exploiting any defensive looseness from a potentially rotated Liverpool XI. Expect high pressing, tight passing triangles, and a push to set the tone early.\n\nStill, one cannot ignore form and momentum. Liverpool will be brimming with confidence and the usual quality they possess, while Chelsea have struggled for consistency.\n\nPrediction: Chelsea 1-1 Liverpool\n\nChelsea vs Liverpool Match Essentials\n\nKick-off: Sunday, May 4, 2025, 4:30pm BST\n\nVenue: Stamford Bridge, London\n\nWatch: Sky Sports es.ulpgc.dacd.businessunit.Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League (from 4pm), stream via Sky Go\n\nHighlights: Sky Sports app, YouTube, BBC Match of the Day 2 at 10:30pm\n\nHead-to-Head Record\n\nChelsea wins: 64\n\nLiverpool wins: 86\n\nDraws: 46\n\nIn the end, it’s a Premier League clash that still delivers on drama, even with the title decided.

It was the realisation of a long-term idea — one Liverpool had quietly nurtured since Jürgen Klopp first walked through the doors. Slot’s success was not lightning in a bottle. It was legacy, refined.\n\nThe Dutchman, arriving from Feyenoord, inherited more than just Klopp’s squad. He stepped into a structure. A footballing identity that had been restored and reinvigorated by the German coach — and critically, one that the club chose to preserve rather than replace.\n\nWhile many questioned whether anyone could possibly follow Klopp, Liverpool instead focused on continuity. Not through sentiment, but through logic. They found someone whose football resonated with the ethos Klopp had embedded. The pressing. The pace. The passion. Slot hasn’t cloned his predecessor — there are tweaks, tactical refinements — but the heart of the team remains unmistakably Liverpool.\n\nGullit’s Praise Reflects Broader Issues in Football Culture\n\nRuud Gullit, speaking on Stick to Football, perfectly captured why this matters. “What I like, for instance, for Liverpool is that Klopp gave you a DNA, it’s what Liverpool is all about, now they’ve got another coach who did exactly the same,” the former Ballon d’Or winner explained.\n\n“There is a slight difference tactically, technically almost the same way. That’s what you need to do, you don’t need to get a new coach who does something totally different, you have to build on that same DNA, and what I see with a lot of clubs is that they lose that.”\n\nGullit’s words echo with frustration at modern football’s impatience. Clubs lurch from one ideology to the next, with identity too often sacrificed for short-term success. Chelsea and Manchester United have become case studies in confusion. Manchester City, for all their trophies, have built success more on Pep Guardiola’s singular brilliance than a deep-rooted cultural template.\n\nLong-Term Thinking Should Be Every Club’s Aspiration\n\nLiverpool’s approach should not be radical. It should be the norm. When Klopp restored the values of the club — intensity, collectiveness, and courage — it wasn’t marketing fluff. It was a footballing philosophy, embedded through recruitment, coaching, and mindset.\n\nSlot’s arrival wasn’t just about finding the best manager available. It was about finding the best manager for Liverpool. That distinction matters. Clubs often mistake star power for suitability. Liverpool looked for synergy — and found it.\n\nIn a sport obsessed with immediacy, Liverpool committed to identity. And they were rewarded not only with stability but success. Slot’s title win isn’t just validation of his quality. It’s proof that a coherent, consistent philosophy can span regimes.\n\nLessons for Clubs Chasing Their Own Identity\n\nWhat Liverpool have shown under Klopp and now Slot is that culture matters. It’s not a slogan or a soundbite — it’s the spine of a successful club. Identity isn’t built in weeks, and it shouldn’t be discarded in months. The Reds have offered a modern-day blueprint for others to follow: know who you are, build accordingly, and stay true when challenges come.\n\nAnd as Ruud Gullit rightly suggests, that’s what too many teams miss. Liverpool, instead, remembered what they stand for — and built on it."}

With that emphatic win, Arne Slot’s Reds secured the club’s 20th league title, an achievement soaked in symbolism, nostalgia, and a powerful sense of continuity. It wasn’t merely about lifting silverware—it was about reaffirming identity, ambition, and legacy in front of a capacity Anfield crowd dressed in red at the request of captain Virgil van Dijk.\n\nThe match-day atmosphere felt less like a final whistle and more like a curtain call on doubt. Slot, in his debut campaign, has managed to preserve and evolve the foundations laid by Jürgen Klopp. As Phil Thompson described it: “Out of 10 it was a 10 all day long. We are unique and we are different.” That sentiment resonated across the generations of Liverpool legends who shared their views on what this title means.\n\nSlot’s Quiet Revolution Speaks Loudly\n\nWhat makes this feat extraordinary is not just its historic weight but the manner in which it was achieved. Slot has orchestrated Liverpool’s return to the summit with minimal fuss and maximal efficiency. Mark Lawrenson observed: “He’s tweaked a few things, only signed one player and you can see he is a very good man-manager.” The Dutchman didn’t tear things down. He refined them—often the hallmark of true leadership.\n\nDavid Fairclough’s comparison with Bob Paisley following Bill Shankly’s departure may seem lofty, but in terms of narrative symmetry and expectation management, it holds weight. Like Paisley, Slot inherited more than a team—he inherited a culture. And like Paisley, he’s shown immediate signs of being able to not just uphold that culture, but enrich it.\n\nAnfield’s Emotional Outpouring\n\nThe emotional scope of the day extended beyond the scoreline. Sammy Lee’s recollection underscored the poignancy of the moment: “When the fans sang You’ll Never Walk Alone at the end with Arne, the staff and the players in front of the Kop… Wow!” This wasn’t just about victory; it was about healing, memory, and unity—especially after the behind-closed-doors title win of 2020.\n\nRobbie Fowler captured the emotional gravity succinctly: “This eclipsed all the European finals because doing it on home soil… makes it extra-special.” The Anfield roar wasn’t just celebrating a goal or a title; it was reclaiming something lost in recent years—shared, collective joy.\n\nClub Icons Reflect on Slot’s Impact\n\nThis wasn’t nostalgia for nostalgia’s sake. It was a procession of club icons—Carragher, Molby, Aldridge, Houghton—validating Slot’s work and recognising how rare this kind of seamless transition truly is. Ronnie Whelan, another ex-skipper, summarised Slot’s contribution perfectly: “You can’t win a league title and be great every week – you have to battle and get results.” Slot’s side didn’t just dazzle; they endured.\n\nTheir reflections echoed what fans felt—this wasn’t just about being good; it was about being Liverpool good. Smart, united, resilient.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool supporters, this wasn’t merely a title—it was a spiritual homecoming. The club’s 19th league crown, claimed in the empty stadiums of the COVID era, had always felt half-celebrated, a dream shouted into a void. But this time? This was the explosion of a decade’s worth of belief, heartbreak, and resilience. Van Dijk’s call for a red Anfield was more than a fashion choice—it was a war cry, and the Kop answered in full voice.\n\nSlot has walked a tightrope with elegance. Replacing Jürgen Klopp was always going to be daunting, but he hasn’t shied away from it—he’s embraced the role, building trust not just with players, but with supporters who were understandably cautious. His calm demeanour, tactical nous, and apparent respect for the club’s identity have all combined to make this season a masterclass in transitional success.\n\nSupporters won’t forget this day—not because of the scoreline, but because it gave back something deeply personal. The past was honoured, the present was conquered, and the future, with Slot at the helm, suddenly looks brighter than anyone dared imagine."}

With the Premier League title secured in Slot’s debut season, attention now turns to shaping a squad capable of sustained domestic and European success.\n\nInterest in Zubimendi Sparked Broader Midfield Search\n\nLiverpool made an approach for Real Sociedad’s Martin Zubimendi last summer, aiming to secure a long-term successor in the holding midfield role. However, their efforts fell short, with Zubimendi opting to remain in La Liga. This setback prompted the Reds to look elsewhere, and one name that gained traction internally was Angelo Stiller of Stuttgart.\n\nAs reported by James Pearce for The Athletic, “When Liverpool failed in their pursuit of Martin Zubimendi last summer, they considered Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller as an alternative but opted to push on with what they had.” That decision was partly informed by the emergence of Ryan Gravenberch, whose performances in a deeper No 6 role provided a solution from within.\n\nAngelo Stiller Profiled as Smart Long-Term Option\n\nStiller, a 23-year-old German midfielder, has quietly impressed in the Bundesliga, showcasing an intelligent reading of the game, tidy distribution, and strong tactical discipline—traits that align with the type of composed anchor Liverpool have previously valued. While not the most physically imposing, his positional awareness and maturity have made him a standout for Stuttgart, particularly under pressure.\n\nPearce’s reporting suggests that although signing a holding midfielder is “no longer a priority,” Stiller remains a player of interest. That nuanced positioning indicates Liverpool are not ruling out a midfield addition if the right profile becomes available—especially one who complements the balance of the current squad.\n\nWataru Endo and Bajcetic Among Midfield Options\n\nDespite his limited minutes in 2024–25—just 157 in the league—Wataru Endo remains a trusted figure in Slot’s plans. His ability to manage games in late stages makes him valuable, particularly given his leadership and tactical acumen. Pearce confirms Endo is “happy and settled at Liverpool” despite reduced game time and is focused on staying sharp ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\n\nMeanwhile, Liverpool are set to assess Stefan Bajcetic during pre-season. The 20-year-old Spaniard has seen his development reignited during a successful loan at Las Palmas in La Liga. According to The Athletic, “His fortunes have improved since he swapped a loan move at Red Bull Salzburg for Las Palmas… the 20-year-old needed regular game time after injuries disrupted his development.”\n\nTyler Morton Poised for Summer Exit\n\nOne midfielder who looks set to move on is academy graduate Tyler Morton. After recovering from shoulder surgery, the 22-year-old is expected to leave Anfield permanently. Liverpool value Morton at around £20 million, and while he has impressed during loan spells, there is an acceptance that his long-term future lies elsewhere.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nLiverpool’s midfield narrative is evolving—less about immediate reinforcements and more about maximising internal resources. Yet, there’s an intriguing strategic logic in continuing to track Angelo Stiller. His technical security and tactical maturity align with the profile Slot seems to favour: intelligent, press-resistant, and adaptable.\n\nWhile Gravenberch’s growing influence in the No 6 role may have reduced urgency, the demands of a 60+ game season across four competitions require depth and variation. Stiller wouldn’t arrive as a starter, but rather as a high-ceiling squad option—ready to slot in when rotation or injuries call.\n\nThere’s also a long-term vision at play. Endo, though dependable, is 31. Bajcetic, still raw and recovering, may need careful reintegration. Slot might find comfort in adding a midfielder who bridges those two poles: experienced enough to contribute now, but young enough to grow with the squad.\n\nUltimately, if the price is right and Stuttgart are open to negotiations, Stiller could be the sort of savvy acquisition that reflects Liverpool’s modern recruitment ethos—strategic, data-driven, and forward-thinking. He may not be Zubimendi, but he could still be the right player at the right time."}

And now, after a run of defining performances in April, recognition arrives in a more visible form: a nomination for Premier League Player of the Month.\n\nIn a season that has demanded leadership in evolution, Mac Allister has become more than a midfielder. He is Liverpool’s tempo-setter, its problem-solver, and increasingly, its match-winner.\n\nForm That Reflects a Champion\n\nApril was no ordinary month. It was the month Liverpool reclaimed their perch atop English football, securing the Premier League title under Arne Slot. Through it all, Mac Allister started every game — five performances that crystallised his importance to this Liverpool side.\n\nHe wasn’t just present; he was decisive.\n\nTwo of his contributions were especially eye-catching: sumptuous, long-range finishes against Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur. The goals were not just technically exquisite — they were moments that punctuated Liverpool’s dominance with class.\n\nAnd then there was the delivery that decided a tight contest. His assist for Virgil van Dijk’s late winner against West Ham United was a moment of calm amid chaos, the kind of cross that suggests vision and conviction in equal measure.\n\nThis wasn’t form built on flash — it was built on control, intelligence, and timing. And it helped guide Liverpool across the line.\n\nRecognition Among Rivals\n\nMac Allister’s name appears on the Premier League Player of the Month shortlist, alongside Rayan Ait-Nouri, Harvey Barnes, Jacob Murphy, Morgan Rogers, Ryan Sessegnon, and Jorgen Strand Larsen.\n\nIt’s a diverse list, each name there on merit. But few can claim to have influenced both ends of the pitch with such balance and assurance.\n\nThere’s an elegance to how Mac Allister moves through a game. Rarely hurried, never wasteful. It’s not just his goals or assists that make him a standout — it’s the way everything seems to orbit around him when Liverpool are in possession.\n\nA Midfielder Made for This Moment\n\nSince his arrival from Brighton, there was little doubt that Mac Allister had the technical pedigree. But what’s become clear in recent weeks is just how complete his profile has become.\n\nAt times, he drops deep and initiates play. At others, he ghosts into space higher up the pitch and unlocks defences. He’s become the ideal bridge between defence and attack, and his understanding with those around him has only deepened with each game.\n\nThat he has found such consistency in a transitional year for Liverpool is no small feat. With Arne Slot taking over from the long-serving Jürgen Klopp, stability was a commodity in short supply. Mac Allister, though, has been a constant — in quality and in presence."}

In James Pearce’s recent article for The Athletic, he captures Elliott’s frustrations with clarity and fairness. Pearce notes that despite Elliott’s obvious talent and commitment, he’s been limited to just 189 Premier League minutes across 14 substitute appearances this season—a stark contrast to the player’s ambitions.\n\nIt’s a jarring narrative for a midfielder whose deep-rooted connection with the club has always been one of his strongest traits. “If I had it my way, that would be here, I would play every game and stay for the rest of my career,” Elliott told the Liverpool Echo. Yet, that dream is increasingly clouded by competition and tactical choices.\n\nSlot’s Tactical Vision Leaves Elliott Marginalised\n\nArne Slot’s first season as Liverpool boss couldn’t have gone better on paper, ending with a historic Premier League title. But with that success has come a more rigid tactical identity—one in which Elliott hasn’t quite fit.\n\nElliott prefers playing as a No 10, dictating play and linking the midfield to the front three. However, Pearce rightly points out that Slot “has opted for the greater physicality and athleticism of Szoboszlai in that position”. While this makes sense from a physical standpoint, it leaves little room for a technician like Elliott, whose game is built on vision, creativity, and quick combinations.\n\nStill, it’s important to underline that Elliott has never shown discontent outwardly. Pearce emphasises that “Elliott’s attitude has remained impeccable and he has made crucial contributions off the bench to help swing tight matches.” His professionalism has never been in question—only his opportunity to shine.\n\nTransfer Speculation Grows Amid Uncertainty\n\nLiverpool’s stance on Elliott is cautious but respectful. According to Pearce, the club want him to stay, but if he seeks more consistent minutes elsewhere, “they would reluctantly consider offers.” That language—”reluctantly”—speaks volumes about how the club still values his presence and potential.\n\nNaturally, interest in Elliott is expected to be strong. A technically gifted, homegrown 22-year-old with Premier League experience and a ceiling yet to be reached will not be short of suitors. Clubs looking for a creative spark in midfield could easily position him as a central figure, which may tempt the player away from Anfield.\n\nLong-Term Implications for Liverpool’s Squad\n\nLetting Elliott leave now could carry long-term consequences. Liverpool aren’t particularly overstocked with midfielders who can unlock defences.\n\nSlot’s current preference for physical profiles may work in the short term, but modern football often requires flexibility. Losing a player like Elliott, who can shift momentum in tight games and who loves the club deeply, might be a strategic misstep in seasons to come.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThis potential departure hits differently. Harvey Elliott isn’t just another promising youngster. He is Liverpool through and through—he lives and breathes the badge. His growth, from watching as a boy to stepping onto the pitch at Anfield, has been a tale every fan wants to believe in. So, the thought of him walking away, not because of a lack of ability but because of a lack of opportunity, is heartbreaking.\n\nWe get it—Slot has brought us the title. He’s earned the right to shape the team as he sees fit. But there’s something very “Liverpool” about giving chances to those who feel like one of us. Elliott is one of us. And even in limited minutes, he’s turned games around, added urgency, and brought quality.\n\nLetting him go now, especially when he’s still only 22, feels premature. We should be building around him, not moving him on. If he leaves, it will be with dignity—but it will leave a scar. Not just on him, but on us too. Because players like Harvey Elliott don’t come along often. And when they do, we should be doing everything we can to keep them."}

A glorified boss rush? Some weird Fortnite-esque live-service Forever Game? Or is it an official replacement for Elden Ring's seamless co-op mod? None of the above, really, and the latest trailer aims to dispel some of those myths and explain exactly what players are getting into through ten minutes of soothingly infomercial-esque narration.\n\nIn the video below, FromSoftware breaks down the structure of the game, piece by piece, from the shifting overworld to the timed rounds, summaries of six of the eight launch classes and a quick look at the meta-progression options available between runs.\n\nELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Overview Trailer - YouTube Watch On\n\nWhile I regrettably missed out playing the network test myself, I got to watch friends streaming it, and I'm eager to give it a spin. I've also got dibs on either the bird-man Guardian (the archetypical greatshield defender class) or the Duchess (an all-or-nothing glass cannon combo fiend with an aesthetic straight out of Bloodborne), although I'm gravitating towards the former purely because of the Solaire alternate skin that they show off in the trailer.\n\nOne thing that is relatively new in this trailer is the mention of personal quests for each of the playable characters. Talking with certain NPCs in the Roundtable Hold (your home between sorties) will unlock bonus objectives in the field which will build on the Deepest Lore of each hero. Probably not a major focus of the game, but it's nice to see a little bit of a narrative hook sprinkled in amongst the loot-hoarding, monster-mashing, semi-speedrunning combat.\n\nThe last segment of the trailer is dedicated to the big Nightlord bosses, which you'll be throwing down with on the third day of each session. While some of them are immediately familiar to anyone that has survived Elden Ring (horrible cosmic skull-bug Astel is returning to thrash another round of asses), there's some interesting new faces in there. I'm a little perturbed by the giant goat-man shaman with far too many giant googly goat eyes, but I especially want to tussle with the chunky-looking one-armed centaur warlord. His moves remind me of Ludwig from Bloodborne.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign launches at the end of the month—May 29th—with pre-orders open now on Steam. There's a £35/$40 regular edition and a £48/$55 deluxe version, which doubles as a preorder on some DLC coming further down the line, including \"additional playable characters and bosses\", hinting at a planned season pass kinda situation."}

They are on the block level. The others are Global Style Variations coming with a block theme, and Sections Style variations, that are for patterns and container blocks.\n\nWordPress includes a few block-level styles. You might have an urge to change them. Adjust them to your theme or branding designs. This post shows you three ways on how to alter those styles.\n\nUse Editor > Styles > Blocks\n\nWordPress offers more than one style for certain blocks. For example, the Buttons block has two styles: Fill and Outline.\n\nContent creators and site builders can change the block’s style on a per-block basis. They can also change it on a per-site basis via the Styles area in the site editor.\n\nOverwrite core block styles via theme.json\n\nAs a developer, you can overwrite the Outline button styles via theme.json file.\n\nThe example code below shows the modification of the core/button variation with a:\n\n0px border radius.\n\n3px wide blue border.\n\nThese styles will replace the default rounded, black, 2px borders.\n\n{ \"$schema\" : \"https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json\" , \"version\" : 2 , \"styles\" : { \"blocks\" : { \"core/button\" : { \"variations\" : { \"outline\" : { \"border\" : { \"color\" : \"blue\" , \"radius\" : \"0\" , \"style\" : \"solid\" , \"width\" : \"3px\" } , } } } } } }\n\n🖼️\n\nFor other core/block styles, you can overwrite their styles in the styles.blocks.core/[block] section of your theme.json file—simply replace [block] above with the actual block name. You can find a detailed walk-through of this process, including a list of available core block styles, on the WordPress.org Developer Blog: Customizing core block style variations via theme.json.\n\nRemoving unwanted core block styles\n\nThere are two functions you’ll need to address:\n\nThe PHP function unregister_block_style()\n\nThe JavaScript function unregisterBlockStyle()\n\nBlock styles can only be unregistered in the same coding language used to register them. Core blocks are all registered via JavaScript. The example code removes the extra block style for the image block called rounded.\n\nwp.domReady( function() { wp.blocks.unregisterBlockStyle( 'core/image', [ 'rounded' ] ); } );\n\nIf you are keen to learn more about how to create block styles, I just published a deep dive into that topic.\n\nMastering Custom Block Styles in WordPress: 6 Methods for Theme and Plugin Developers\n\nResources to learn more\n\nFor more ways to change the block editor, read 15 ways to curate the WordPress editing experience.\n\nFor more articles on the various styles, there are great articles on the WordPress Developer blog:\n\nWhat are other questions you might have about changing core blocks via the Global Styles?

Keys have been exchanged successfully across cities and even between a spacecraft and a ground station. Such feats usually require complex, expensive equipment. Now Feihu Xu and Jian-Wei Pan of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and their collaborators have demonstrated QKD over 403 km of standard optical fiber using off-the shelf lasers [1]. At nearly 48 bits per second (bit/s), their key distribution rate is high enough for some real-world applications.\n\nDespite optical fiber’s impressive transparency, QKD photons traveling through a fiber eventually get scattered or absorbed and lose their entanglement. One way to extend the transmission distance is to place an intermediary—based on an interferometer—halfway between the source and the receiver. The two parties don’t have to trust the intermediary, but it does need to be able to accurately compare the streams of photons coming from them. This comparison can be achieved using a technique called mode pairing, which uses a clever way to pair up the incoming photons. The method requires tracking the photon frequencies, which ordinarily entails additional equipment, including high-quality lasers for both parties. Xu and his colleagues figured out that performing a fast Fourier transform on the photons serves to track the frequencies even when lower-quality lasers are used.\n\nThe QKD performance achieved by the USTC team falls short for securely sharing video and other high-bandwidth applications. But, Xu says, “Our result of 47.8 bit/s over 403 km is already sufficient for many high-security applications, such as secure messaging, key distribution for financial transactions, or authentication in communications over long distances.”\n\n–Charles Day\n\nCharles Day is a Senior Editor for Physics Magazine.\n\nReferences et al., “Experimental mode-pairing quantum key distribution surpassing the repeaterless bound,” L.

Siri, ChatGPT, and Perplexity each bring unique strengths to the table, but their capabilities vary depending on your specific requirements. Whether you prioritize seamless app integration, conversational intelligence, or advanced problem-solving, understanding the differences between these assistants is essential to making an informed choice. The video below from 9to5Mac gives us more details.\n\nArtificial Intelligence: The Core of Voice Assistants\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) forms the foundation of Siri, ChatGPT, and Perplexity, allowing them to interpret and respond to your commands. Siri uses AI for straightforward tasks such as sending messages, setting reminders, or checking the weather. In contrast, ChatGPT and Perplexity use more advanced AI models, allowing them to handle complex conversations and provide in-depth solutions. The distinction lies in their AI implementation: Siri focuses on efficiency within the Apple ecosystem, while ChatGPT and Perplexity aim to deliver broader conversational capabilities. Understanding these differences is crucial when evaluating their overall performance.\n\nNatural Language Processing: Understanding Your Commands\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is the technology that allows voice assistants to interpret and respond to your spoken or typed commands. Siri’s NLP is optimized for simple, task-oriented commands like “Call Mom” or “Set a timer for 10 minutes.” It excels in executing direct instructions quickly and efficiently. On the other hand, ChatGPT and Perplexity shine in handling more complex queries. For example, if you ask ChatGPT to explain the principles of quantum mechanics, it can provide a detailed, structured explanation. Siri, in such cases, often redirects users to web search results. This difference highlights how ChatGPT and Perplexity are better suited for users seeking deeper insights or conversational engagement.\n\nVoice Recognition: Accuracy and Accessibility\n\nVoice recognition plays a pivotal role in making sure that these assistants can accurately interpret your spoken commands. Siri’s voice recognition is deeply integrated into iOS, offering a smooth, hands-free experience. Whether you’re dictating a message or asking for directions, Siri’s ability to recognize your voice commands is reliable and efficient. ChatGPT and Perplexity also support voice recognition, but they often rely on third-party apps or interfaces, which can introduce additional steps and reduce the overall seamlessness of the experience. For users seeking quick and accurate voice-based interactions, Siri remains a strong contender.\n\nApp Integration: Siri’s Strength in the Apple Ecosystem\n\nFor users who rely on apps to manage their daily tasks, Siri’s app integration is a significant advantage. It works seamlessly with Apple’s native apps like iMessages, Calendar, and Apple Maps, as well as many third-party apps such as Spotify and WhatsApp. This integration allows you to send texts, play music, or navigate without leaving the Apple ecosystem. In comparison, Perplexity offers limited app integration, and ChatGPT currently lacks this feature entirely. For iPhone users who prioritize productivity and convenience, Siri’s ability to integrate with apps gives it a competitive edge.\n\nAdvanced Problem-Solving and Summarization: ChatGPT’s Expertise\n\nWhen it comes to solving complex problems or summarizing large amounts of information, ChatGPT stands out. Its advanced algorithms enable it to condense lengthy articles into concise summaries or provide step-by-step solutions to intricate problems. For instance, if you need a summary of a research paper or guidance on solving a challenging math problem, ChatGPT delivers accurate and detailed responses. Perplexity also performs well in these areas, though it often requires user confirmation before proceeding, which can slow down the process. Siri, while effective for basic tasks, lacks the depth and sophistication needed for advanced problem-solving.\n\nNavigation and Location-Based Features: Siri’s Reliability\n\nFor navigation and location-based tasks, Siri remains the most reliable choice. Its integration with Apple Maps ensures accurate and efficient directions, whether you’re driving, walking, or using public transportation. Perplexity offers limited navigation capabilities, and ChatGPT does not support navigation tasks at all. This makes Siri the go-to option for users who frequently rely on their iPhone for travel and location-based assistance.\n\nContextual Understanding: Adapting to Your Needs\n\nContextual understanding is a critical feature for maintaining coherent conversations and addressing complex queries. ChatGPT excels in this area, offering detailed and contextually relevant responses that adapt to the flow of your questions. Perplexity also performs well but occasionally requires clarification to maintain accuracy. Siri, while improving, still struggles with contextual understanding and often defaults to web searches when faced with intricate queries. For users who value conversational depth and adaptability, ChatGPT offers a more intelligent and engaging experience.\n\nUser Confirmation: Perplexity’s Unique Approach\n\nOne feature that sets Perplexity apart is its user confirmation system. Before executing certain actions, such as sending an email or initiating navigation, it asks for your explicit approval. This added layer of security ensures accuracy and prevents unintended actions, making it a safer option for tasks that require precision. However, this feature can slow down workflows for users who prioritize speed and efficiency. Siri and ChatGPT, by contrast, focus on executing commands quickly, which may appeal to users who value convenience over caution.\n\nKnowledge Depth: Comparing Responses\n\nAll three assistants rely on extensive knowledge databases to answer your questions, but the depth of their responses varies. Siri provides concise, straightforward answers, making it ideal for quick, factual queries. ChatGPT and Perplexity, however, offer more detailed explanations. For instance, if you ask about the history of Paris, Siri might give you a brief summary, while ChatGPT could provide a comprehensive overview, including historical events and cultural significance. This makes ChatGPT and Perplexity better suited for users seeking in-depth information.\n\nChoosing the Right Voice Assistant for Your Needs\n\nYour choice of voice assistant ultimately depends on your priorities and how you use your iPhone.\n\nSiri: Best for users who value seamless app integration and efficient task management. Its tight integration with Apple’s ecosystem makes it ideal for everyday use.\n\nBest for users who value seamless app integration and efficient task management.

Mueller/Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light No more DIY. The design of optics setups can be automated, according to new research results. ×\n\nResearchers in optics and photonics rely on devices that interact with light in order to transport it, amplify it, or change its frequency, and designing these devices can be painstaking work requiring human ingenuity. Now a research team has demonstrated that the discovery of the core design concepts can be automated using machine learning, which can rapidly provide efficient designs for a wide range of uses [1]. The team hopes the approach will streamline research and development for scientists and engineers who work with optical, mechanical, or electrical waves, or with combinations of these wave types.\n\nWhen a researcher needs a transducer, an amplifier, or a similar element in their experimental setup, they draw on design concepts tested and proven in earlier experiments. “There are literally hundreds of articles that describe ideas for the design of devices,” says Florian Marquardt of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany. Researchers often adapt an existing design to their specific needs. But there is no standard procedure to find the best design, and researchers could miss out on simpler designs that would be easier to implement.\n\nInspired by recent progress in applications of machine learning across the sciences, Marquardt and colleagues wondered if the design procedure could be improved. “Our aim was to find a way to search through the space of possible design concepts in some automated and efficient way,” he says.\n\nThe researchers represented the possible design concepts as networks of interlinked “modes.” A mode could be any kind of resonant cavity or structure able to trap microwaves, optical waves, or even mechanical vibrations. Examples include a microwave cavity in a superconducting chip or an optical cavity in an integrated photonic circuit. In the network representation, links between the modes represent physical interactions enabling one mode to influence another.\n\nThe team’s network representation reflects the strengths of the connections by assigning a number to each link between modes. There are also some input modes, into which signals can be injected, and some output modes that can deliver the desired result. This representation allows machine learning to optimize the design for any input-to-output relationship. The algorithm the team developed simultaneously optimizes the network structure and the link strength parameters to find setups that yield the ideal behavior.\n\n“The main challenge was to find an efficient way to go through the large space of possible designs,” Marquardt says. “We found a way to drastically ‘prune’ the search by inferring, based on the first few tested networks, which ones would be automatically ruled out.”\n\nTo test their scheme, Marquardt and colleagues employed it for several design tasks. For example, they used it to design an isolator—a device that provides perfect transmission with no loss of energy from the input to the output while also ensuring zero reverse transmission. Isolators have been developed for a wide range of wavelengths and applications. The algorithm quickly found the most efficient solution in a simple setup, one that had already been discovered by engineers using conventional techniques.\n\nBut in more challenging design cases, the researchers found that the machine-learning approach yielded superior results and new designs that had not been found previously. For example, they looked for schemes suitable for amplifying signals from a quantum computer. Here, the key measures of the complexity of the design are the number of modes and the number of interaction pathways required between the different modes. The best design known so far relies on four modes with six interaction pathways, but the automated procedure provided a design with the same behavior using only three modes with three interaction pathways. The team also described how to use the designs to build real hardware for waves of a wide range of wavelengths, from microwaves to visible light.\n\n“This research is both exciting and timely,” says Andreas Nunnenkamp, an expert in quantum control and many-body physics at the University of Vienna. “I imagine that this kind of automated scientific discovery will become an indispensable part of the toolbox for both experimentalists and theorists.” In future work, the researchers plan to look into the automated design of periodic systems, where waves can propagate in spatially extended structures.\n\n–Mark Buchanan\n\nMark Buchanan is a freelance science writer who splits his time between Abergavenny, UK, and Notre Dame de Courson, France."}

Enter the farm fresh chicken egg – the new preferred way to tell how well or poorly we're doing as a nation!\n\n\n\nUnless you've been marooned on a desert island or mountain-climbing without the Internet, you cannot help but have noticed that the ordinary chicken egg has pushed the gallon of gas and the pound of ground beef off the field of contenders for the top economic pain barometer.\n\nThe supermarket has overtaken the filling station where we are now spending the lion's share of our disposable income, especially if we have large families.\n\nSince COVID struck, and our supply chains and production facilities were interrupted, Americans have been experiencing an increasingly higher level of food-related anxiety. Price rises have become the bane of our existence and changed our buying habits, markedly. Now, trips to the market are planned with D-Day-like precision. We comparison-shop and prepare extensive shopping lists that contain fewer and fewer impulse or snack food items. We're clipping coupons if we still have a newspaper subscription or we watch our mobile phones for announcements of discounts on our favorite food products. We've downsized our food expectations and relegated certain comfort or luxury foods to the bottom of our lists. Bags of potato chips are now costing upwards of $6.00, not to mention breakfast cereals that are packaged with less content for the same or even higher prices. We've also deserted name brands in favor of generic or \"house\" brands to save some money, hoping that taste and quality are not victims of our penny-pinching purchases.\n\n\n\nEven vegetarians are paying a high price for their virtue. Green vegetables and fruits now command more and more from our pocketbooks, forcing some families to forego garden fresh, organic, healthy food. And those trips to the fast food establishments are also making us cough up more of our hard-earned money to satisfy his highness, the Burger King, or to placate our children, who do not share our parsimony.\n\n\n\nAnd now, after all those years of gas and hamburger comparisons, we have the egg to contend with.\n\nMost of us have always regarded eggs as a commodity, a staple, a necessity, but not something to be overly worried about when it came to the occasional rise in poultry feed. We always knew we could count on eggs being there for us, like good friends that always made themselves available when we needed them. Even during outbreaks of avian flu we knew that eggs would bounce back and prices would fall again once things settled down. There was nothing magic about eggs. We accepted their cholesterol and protein content as part of the deal to enjoy our breads, desserts and our hearty breakfasts at the Waffle or Pancake House.\n\n\n\nThese days, egg displays at upscale supermarkets have taken on an air of luxury, and are now enjoying their life at the top of the food price pyramid. Comedians are telling egg jokes. Economists are studying their ability to forecast the country's economic future and journalists are penning articles about their exorbitant prices and castigating the current administration for not taking the \"egg war\" seriously.\n\n\n\nNotice how I have avoided using any egg puns in this article. It is not because I haven't been tempted, it is just because eggs have now become the new economic third rail and I do not want to be the cause of egg producers' attacks on me for disparaging their products. And since any good article must have some statistics to be readable or memorable, here are a few:\n\n\n\nAccording to Statista, over 9 billion dozen eggs were produced in the U.S. in 2023. That's over 280 eggs for every man, woman and child in the U.S. (source: the Washington Post). Not to be outdone, China remains at the top of egg-producing countries in the world (source: The American Egg Board).\n\nThe World Atlas says that our friendly McDonald's hamburger chain buys 2 billion eggs a year from different sources. But before you conclude that all those egg purchases are for American chicken-laid eggs, think again. The U.S. imports nearly $80 million worth of eggs from Canada, the U.K., China, Turkey and Belgium. America's – strike that – the world's largest egg producer/supplier is Cal-Maine Foods, located in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n\n\nAnd when it comes to foreign producers, the world's largest exporter of eggs is The Netherlands, clucking in, strike that, clocking in, with $1 billion in exports, or nearly 20% of all global egg exports. (And you thought the Dutch only grew tulips and made cheese in that densely populated little country of theirs, built on land reclaimed from the sea.)\n\nFinally, the U.S. Inflation Calculator reported that: \"In March, the average price of one dozen Grade A eggs was $6.227, representing a 5.6% increase from the February price of $5.897, data released April 10, 2025, by the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed. Over a longer period and averaging the BLS’s monthly pricing data, the cost of a dozen eggs jumped to $3.17 in 2024 from $2.80 in 2023, representing a 13.2% increase.\"\n\n\n\nWhichever way you boil down the numbers or fry up the statistics, Americans love their eggs and will probably continue to pay whatever it costs to keep themselves in a perpetual state of albumen. And that is very definitely a lot of yolks. I suspect that U.S. consumers' very personal relationship with their eggs will, eventually, persuade them to return the lowly gallon of gas back down the ranks to be the measurement of the country's economic vulnerability, proving that the egg is resilient and is indeed mightier than the fuel that takes them to our tables. After all, it's purely eggumenical, my dear Watson.\n\n\n\nStephen Helgesen is a retired career U.S. diplomat specializing in international trade who lived and worked in 30 countries for 25 years during the Reagan, G.H.W.

I know myself I’m still grandfather in pocketcast. I’m alpha member on thurrott still grandfathered in at $42 dollars year. My question is have you ever thought of changing your pricing models. I know you offer a few different pricing models. Any thoughts changing site and moving to something like memberful just asking not saying the site should change. Memberful would made it easier if it was around when thurrott launched remember all the crazyness with the premium FRD in the beginning and feed not working. Good times :)\n\nI haven't looked at Memberful specifically, but yes, I've been thinking a lot about the future and what this might look like. I can't claim to have specific plans here, but I feel like continued change is inevitable.\n\nTo start at a high level, I'm sure I've written at some point about retirement and how this isn't really a concept that applies to me. I'm a writer, not a coal miner, so I should be able to write for as long as I want, and I feel like being engaged in this fashion is healthy long-term. I'm not going to sit on a chair on the beach with a drink in my hand. But I may sometimes sit on a chair on the beach with a laptop and get some work done. That's the nice thing about this job. I can do it from anywhere.\n\nLower-level, when we transitioned Thurrott.com from George to me (or, for legal reasons, to a new company called Thurrott LLC that is basically me), I made a number of changes tied to streamlining the backend we have, which lowered the cost of doing business and made it more viable as a standalone operation. Since then, I've done nothing in regard to marketing or sales or whatever and have pretty much coasted in a business sense. Not out of laziness, but because I'm fundamentally just a writer and not a business person, and this isn't where my head is at.\n\nThis year, we've endured two episodes that speak to a common dynamic in business in which one typically reacts to problems as they occur rather than somehow magically predicting them and working to prevent them ahead of time: YouTube without warning or good reason took away our access to the service back in January, and then we had the fun little site outage yesterday and were down for the better part of a day for the first time in, I think, years. Years ago, I suffered some data loss on a PC and observed that people typically get backup religion when they lose data.

However, after two months of real-world use, the question remains: does it justify its premium price compared to the M2 Ultra? While the M3 Ultra introduces modest improvements in CPU, GPU, and media engine performance, these enhancements may not be compelling enough for most users to upgrade. Let’s delve into its performance, use cases, and cost-effectiveness to help you make an informed decision in a new video from Matt Talks Tech.\n\nPerformance: Incremental Gains Over the M2 Ultra\n\nThe M3 Ultra delivers slight performance improvements over its predecessor, the M2 Ultra. Benchmarks indicate marginally faster CPU and GPU speeds, but the differences are often negligible for most workflows. Tasks such as video exporting, rendering, and 3D modeling show only minor reductions in completion times, often measured in seconds rather than minutes.\n\nCPU Performance: The M3 Ultra features a small increase in core count and clock speed, resulting in better performance for both single-threaded and multi-threaded tasks. However, the M2 Ultra’s CPU remains more than adequate for demanding workloads, making the upgrade less impactful for most users.\n\nThe M3 Ultra features a small increase in core count and clock speed, resulting in better performance for both single-threaded and multi-threaded tasks. However, the M2 Ultra’s CPU remains more than adequate for demanding workloads, making the upgrade less impactful for most users. GPU Enhancements: The M3 Ultra’s GPU offers a slight boost in rendering and graphics-intensive tasks. While this may benefit users working with highly complex 3D models or ultra-high-resolution video projects, the real-world impact is minimal for the majority of professionals.\n\nFor most users, the performance gap between the M2 Ultra and M3 Ultra is too narrow to warrant an upgrade, especially if your current workflows are already running efficiently.\n\nMedia Engine: Limited Advancements\n\nBoth the M2 Ultra and M3 Ultra are equipped with four media encoders and decoders, which are essential for tasks like video editing, music production, and RAW file handling. These media engines excel at accelerating video exporting, playback, and other media-intensive processes, even when working with demanding formats such as 8K ProRes.\n\nHowever, the M3 Ultra does not introduce any significant advancements in its media engine. This lack of innovation limits its appeal for media professionals who rely heavily on these features. If your work involves frequent video exporting or RAW file processing, the M2 Ultra already provides exceptional performance without the need for an upgrade.\n\nWho Should Consider the M3 Ultra?\n\nThe M3 Ultra may appeal to a specific subset of users, but for most professionals, the M2 Ultra remains the more practical choice. Below is a breakdown of who might benefit from the M3 Ultra and who might not:\n\nMedia Professionals: If your primary focus is on video editing, music production, or handling RAW files, the M2 Ultra Mac Studio offers robust performance at a lower cost. Its powerful CPU, GPU, and media engine make it a reliable and cost-effective workhorse.\n\nIf your primary focus is on video editing, music production, or handling RAW files, the M2 Ultra Mac Studio offers robust performance at a lower cost.

Early expectations suggest it will deliver more substantial improvements across a broader range of applications. Innovative Enthusiasts: If you prioritize having the latest technology and are willing to pay a premium for incremental improvements, the M3 Ultra could be a suitable option. However, this group represents a niche audience.\n\nFor the majority of professionals, the M2 Ultra remains a more balanced and economical choice, offering nearly identical performance at a significantly lower price.\n\nCost-Effectiveness: A Critical Factor\n\nThe M3 Ultra’s high price tag is one of its most notable drawbacks. In contrast, the M2 Ultra Mac Studio, especially when purchased secondhand, provides nearly equivalent performance at a much lower cost. This makes the M2 Ultra a far more practical option for budget-conscious professionals.\n\nUnless you require the absolute latest hardware for highly specialized tasks, the M3 Ultra’s incremental upgrades do not justify its premium price. For most users, the M2 Ultra delivers comparable capabilities without the added expense, making it the smarter investment.\n\nLooking Ahead: Future Chip Releases\n\nApple’s roadmap for future chip releases, such as the anticipated M4 Ultra or M5 Ultra, promises more substantial advancements. These upcoming models are expected to feature enhanced media engines, additional CPU and GPU cores, and improved energy efficiency. For professionals who can afford to wait, these future iterations may offer a more significant leap in performance and value.\n\nThe M3 Ultra, while a capable machine, represents only a modest step forward. If you’re considering an upgrade, it may be worth holding out for the next generation of chips, which are likely to deliver more meaningful improvements for a wider range of users.\n\nBelow are more guides on M3 Ultra Mac Studio from our extensive range of articles.\n\nSource & Image Credit: Matt Talks Tech\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

(NOW): Strong Beat, Raised Targets — Why Analysts Are Doubling Down on AI Workflow Powerhouse", "fullContent": "We recently published a list of 12 AI Stocks Making Waves Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other AI stocks making waves today.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry recently released a video on its social media feeds, complete with a voice-over in American-accented English, comparing the acceptance of U.S. President Donald Trump’s 145% tariffs to “drinking poison”.\n\n“China won’t kneel down, because we know standing up for ourselves keeps the possibility of cooperation alive, while compromise snuffs it out… Imperialists are always arrogant. If they show a bit of reason it’s only because they are forced to do so”\n\nA Chinese official revealed that Beijing believes yielding or compromising now would only weaken China in the future and that it would authorize Trump to change the terms later. These ongoing tariff riots aren’t superficial, rather, they are a reflection of deeper tensions in the ongoing US-China rivalry, particularly over dominance in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 AI Stocks Analysts Are Talking About Right Now and 10 AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week.\n\nIn the initial days of the tariff frenzy, former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland had called on President Donald Trump to take the threat of tariffs off the table. She argued that the U.S. will need Canadian energy in the race to achieve dominance in artificial intelligence.\n\nFreeland has deemed the tariffs as “the dumbest trade war in history,” stating how the U.S.-Canada trade relationship is largely balanced when oil, gas, and electricity are excluded. She said that the tariff threat needs to be taken “definitively off the table.”\n\n“You are really lucky that Canada is the country that sells you oil and gas and electricity. We are a much more reliable supplier than, say, Venezuela. And the fact is, particularly with AI, America’s needs for energy are only going to increase.”\n\nCanada aside, the artificial intelligence boom is being slowed due to the overall global trade war triggered by the Trump administration. Upcoming earnings reports from tech giants and utilities powering the massive data centers will reveal whether tit-for-tat tariffs, particularly between the U.S. and China, are making businesses change their plans for building data centers and other infrastructure.\n\nChina plays an important role in the production of AI hardware. It was excluded from a 90-day tariff reprieve earlier. According to analysts, the 145% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will sharply increase data center costs if an exemption on electronics is rolled back."}

As all things are here, it’s never a one-man effort, not a one-woman effort, but it’s a communications product.”\n\nThe eye-catching style of the site is meant to give readers a “digestible format” that’s “not overly complicated,” this person added.\n\n“This is just kind of a no-brainer, in my personal opinion, to put all that coverage in one place, for folks to take a look at, folks to digest or to share,” they said. “I think it’s really important that we go to the American people. They don’t have to come to us, you know, looking for information. And I thought, what better way than to put all that coverage in one spot?\n\n3 The White House’s new website is meant to be “digestible” for readers. whitehouse.gov/wire\n\n“It’s just an easy-to-digest form and just, if it looks similar to someone else’s stuff, so be it. But I think it’s different and but it kind of achieves the same intended goal.”\n\nThe “wire” branding of the website comes after the White House removed the Associated Press, Reuters and Bloomberg from their traditional spots in the press pool following a court fight with the AP over access.\n\nA federal judge ruled the AP — which miffed the administration for its refusal to use the term “Gulf of America” — has to have the same access as the other outlets, prompting the White House to strip wire reporters of guaranteed daily access to the commander-in-chief.\n\n3 The headlines feature news from the administration. whitehouse.gov/wire\n\n3 President Trump disembarks from Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport, West Palm Beach, Florida, May 1, 2025. REUTERS\n\nAs of midday Friday, the website included links to Trump’s Truth Social posts, the administration’s “rapid response” X account, official statements, and articles and op-ed pieces from outlets including Fox News, Breitbart, the Washington Post, Washington Times and Washington Examiner.\n\nThe effort, the White House official said, is a part of its “new media strategy” to shake up the media landscape.\n\n“In the run-up to the 100 days, you know, we did 100 interviews from the White House,” the official said. “This is just another part of that strategy, making sure that it’s in one place, digestible for the public. I can’t stress that enough that it’s about just knocking down barriers and making things as accessible as possible, making sure people don’t have to do all the world.”"}

The Trump administration is legally obligated to produce the assessment, but the White House told CBS News that it's evaluating the scope of the assessment that it will publish.\n\nThe National Climate Assessment is a major publication produced every four years that summarizes the impacts of climate change in the U.S., and it is congressionally mandated under the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The sixth edition is scheduled for publication in 2027, and preparations have been underway for months to meet that deadline.\n\nThe assessment helps federal, state and local governments and businesses to prepare for the impacts of climate change and adapt to and mitigate challenges arising from climate change.\n\nAmerican Meteorological Society president David Stensrud praised the National Climate Assessment as \"a comprehensive, rigorous integration and evaluation of the latest climate science knowledge that decision makers — from government at all levels to private enterprise — need in order to understand the world in which we live.\" He said it's \"vital to support and help expand this collaborative scientific effort\" to benefit the U.S. and the world.\n\nThe American Geophysical Union and American Meteorological Society told CBS News in an email that their new effort will be a \"collection of scientific papers from across multiple journals that address a particular topic,\" and the focus on the collection will be climate change in the United States.\n\nAmerican Geophysical Union president Brandon Jones said in a statement, \"This collaboration provides a critical pathway for a wide range of researchers to come together and provide the science needed to support the global enterprise pursuing solutions to climate change.\"\n\nThe two organizations will open the effort to any scientists who want to submit original work or review articles. Authors who were released from writing the sixth National Climate Assessment are being encouraged to participate and submit their work.\n\nThe AGU and AMS have not determined when this new collection of climate change research will be published. The groups told CBS News in an email that it's likely to take months, or even years, to produce the full catalogue of research, since every submission will need to undergo a rigorous peer-review process."}

This takes the annual payment to 3.4% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry.\n\nOur free stock report includes 2 warning signs investors should be aware of before investing in Corbion. Read for free now.\n\nCorbion's Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future Distributions\n\nWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. The last payment made up 81% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 92.1% over the next year. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 45% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.\n\nENXTAM:CRBN Historic Dividend May 2nd 2025\n\nView our latest analysis for Corbion\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from €0.21 total annually to €0.64. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. Corbion has grown distributions at a rapid rate despite cutting the dividend at least once in the past. Companies that cut once often cut again, so we would be cautious about buying this stock solely for the dividend income.\n\nCorbion's Dividend Might Lack Growth\n\nGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Corbion has impressed us by growing EPS at 12% per year over the past five years. EPS has been growing at a reasonable rate, although with most of the profits being paid out to shareholders, growth prospects could be more limited in the future.\n\nIn Summary\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Corbion's payments are rock solid. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Corbion that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
