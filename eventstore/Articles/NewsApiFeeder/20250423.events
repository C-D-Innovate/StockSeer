Yet, because of it’s ease and simplicity to just “get something working”, it’s also one of the most underappreciated.\n\nIf you search for Top 10 Advanced Python Tricks on Google or any other search engine, you’ll find tons of blogs or LinkedIn articles going over trivial (but still useful) things like generators or tuples .\n\nHowever, as someone who’s written Python for the past 12 years, I’ve come across a lot of really interesting, underrated, unique, or (as some might say) “un-pythonic” tricks to really level up what Python can do.\n\nThat’s why I decided to compile the top 14 of said features alongside examples and additional resources if you want to dive deeper into any of them.\n\nThese tips & tricks were originally featured as part of a 14-day series on X/Twitter between March 1st and March 14th (pi-day, hence why there are 14 topics in the article). All X/Twitter links will also be accompanied with a Nitter mirror. Nitter is a privacy-abiding open source Twitter frontend. Learn more about the project here.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Typing Overloads\n\n@overload is a decorator from Python’s typing module that lets you define multiple signatures for the same function. Each overload tells the type checker exactly what types to expect when specific parameters are passed in.\n\nNote that Python’s @overload works differently than some other languages. In Python, @overload tells the type checker to expect different signatures for the same function. It doesn’t actually define multiple versions of the function itself, unlike Java or C++.\n\nFor example, the code below dictates that only list[str] can be returned if mode=split , and only str can be returned if mode=upper . (The Literal type also forces mode to be either one of split or upper )\n\nfrom typing import Literal, overload @overload def transform (data: str, mode: Literal[ \"split\" ]) -> list[str]: ... @overload def transform (data: str, mode: Literal[ \"upper\" ]) -> str: ... def transform (data: str, mode: Literal[ \"split\" , \"upper\" ]) -> list[str] | str: if mode == \"split\" : return data . split() else : return data . upper() split_words = transform( \"hello world\" , \"split\" ) # Return type is list[str] split_words[ 0 ] # Type checker is happy upper_words = transform( \"hello world\" , \"upper\" ) # Return type is str upper_words . lower() # Type checker is happy upper_words . append( \"!\" ) # Cannot access attribute \"append\" for \"str\"\n\nOverloads can do more than just change return type based on arguments! In another example, we use typing overloads to ensure that either one of id OR username are passed in, but never both.\n\n@overload def get_user (id: int = ... , username: None = None ) -> User: ... @overload def get_user (id: None = None , username: str = ... ) -> User: ... def get_user (id: int | None = None , username: str | None = None ) -> User: ... get_user(id = 1 ) # Works! get_user(username = \"John\" ) # Works! get_user(id = 1 , username = \"John\" ) # No overloads for \"get_user\" match the provided arguments\n\nThe ... is a special value often used in overloads to indicate that a parameter is optional, but still requires a value.\n\n✨ Quick bonus trick: As you probably saw, Python also has support for String Literals. These help assert that only specific string values can be passed to a parameter, giving you even more type safety. Think of them like a lightweight form of Enums!\n\ndef set_color (color: Literal[ \"red\" , \"blue\" , \"green\" ]) -> None : ... set_color( \"red\" ) set_color( \"blue\" ) set_color( \"green\" ) set_color( \"fuchsia\" ) # Argument of type \"Literal['fuchsia']\" cannot be assigned to parameter \"color\"\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n2. Keyword-only and Positional-only Arguments\n\nBy default, both required parameters and optional parameters can be assigned with both positional and keyword syntax. However, what if you don’t want that to happen? Keyword-only and Positional-only args let you control that.\n\ndef foo (a, b, / , c, d, * , e, f): # ^ ^ # Ever seen these before? ...\n\n* (asterisk) marks keyword-only parameters. Arguments after * must be passed as keyword arguments.\n\n# KW+POS | KW ONLY # vv | vv def foo (a, * , b): ... # == ALLOWED == foo(a = 1 , b = 2 ) # All keyword foo( 1 , b = 2 ) # Half positional, half keyword # == NOT ALLOWED == foo( 1 , 2 ) # Cannot use positional for keyword-only parameter # ^\n\n/ (forward slash) marks positional-only parameters. Arguments before / must be passed positionally and cannot be used as keyword arguments.\n\n# POS ONLY | KW POS # vv | vv def bar (a, / , b): ... # == ALLOWED == bar( 1 , 2 ) # All positional bar( 1 , b = 2 ) # Half positional, half keyword # == NOT ALLOWED == bar(a = 1 , b = 2 ) # Cannot use keyword for positional-only parameter # ^\n\nKeyword-only and Positional-only arguments are especially helpful for API developers to enforce how their arguments may be used and passed in.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n3. Future Annotations\n\nA quick history lesson into Python’s typing:\n\nThis is less of a “Python Feature” and more of a history lesson into Python’s type system, and what from __future__ import annotations does if you ever encounter it in production code.\n\nPython’s typing system started off as a hack. Function annotation syntax was first introduced with PEP 3107 back in Python 3.0 as purely an extra way to decorate functions with no actual type-checking functionality.\n\nProper specifications for type annotations were later added in Python 3.5 through PEP 484, but they were designed to be evaluated at bound / definition time. This worked great for simple cases, but it increasingly caused headaches with one type of problem: forward references.\n\nThis meant that forward references (using a type before it gets defined) required falling back to string literals, making the code less elegant and more error-prone.\n\n# This won't work class Foo : def action (self) -> Foo: # The `-> Foo` return annotation is evaluated immediately during definition, # but the class `Foo` is not yet fully defined at that point, # causing a NameError during type checking. ...\n\n# This is the workaround -> Using string types class Bar : def action (self) -> \"Bar\" : # Workaround with string literals, but ugly and error-prone ...\n\nIntroduced as a PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal), PEP 563: Postponed Evaluation of Annotations aimed to fix this by changing when type annotations were evaluated. Instead of evaluating annotations at definition time, PEP 563 “string-ifies” types behind the scenes and postpones evaluation until they’re actually needed, typically during static analysis. This allows for cleaner forward references without explicitly defining string literals and reduces the runtime overhead of type annotations.\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations class Foo : def bar (self) -> Foo: # Works now! ...\n\nSo what was the problem?\n\nFor type checkers, this change is largely transparent. But because PEP 563 implements this by essentially treating all types as strings behind the scenes, anything that relies on accessing return types at runtime (i.e., ORMs, serialization libraries, validators, dependency injectors, etc.) will have compatibility issues with the new setup.\n\nThat’s why even after ten years after the initial proposal, modern Python (3.13 as of writing this) still relies on the same hacked-together type system introduced in Python 3.5.\n\n# ===== Regular Python Typing ===== def foobar () -> int: return 1 ret_type = foobar . __annotations__ . get( \"return\" ) ret_type # Returns: <class 'int'> new_int = ret_type()\n\n# ===== With Postponed Evaluation ===== from __future__ import annotations def foobar () -> int: return 1 ret_type = foobar . __annotations__ . get( \"return\" ) ret_type # \"int\" (str) new_int = ret_type() # TypeError: 'str' object is not callable\n\nRecently, PEP 649 proposes a new method to handle Python function and class annotations through deferred, or “lazy,” evaluation. Instead of evaluating annotations at the time of function or class definition, as is traditionally done, this approach delays their computation until they are actually accessed.\n\nThis is achieved by compiling the annotation expressions into a separate function, stored in a special __annotate__ attribute. When the __annotations__ attribute is accessed for the first time, this function is invoked to compute and cache the annotations, making them readily available for subsequent accesses.\n\n# Example code from the PEP 649 proposal class function : # __annotations__ on a function object is already a # \"data descriptor\" in Python, we're just changing # what it does @property def __annotations__ (self): return self . __annotate__() # ... def annotate_foo (): return { 'x' : int, 'y' : MyType, 'return' : float} def foo (x = 3 , y = \"abc\" ): ... foo . __annotate__ = annotate_foo class MyType : ... foo_y_annotation = foo . __annotations__[ 'y' ]\n\nThis deferred evaluation strategy addresses issues like forward references and circular dependencies, as annotations are only evaluated when needed. Moreover, it enhances performance by avoiding the immediate computation of annotations that might not be used, and maintains full semantic information, supporting introspection and runtime type-checking tools.\n\n✨ Bonus Fact: Since Python 3.11, Python now supports a “Self” type (PEP 673) that allows for proper typing of methods that return instances of their own class, solving this particular example of self-referential return types.\n\nfrom typing import Self class Foo : def bar (self) -> Self: ...\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n4. Generics\n\nDid you know that Python has Generics? In fact, since Python 3.12, a newer, sleeker, and sexier syntax for Generics was introduced.\n\nclass KVStore [K: str | int, V]: def __init__ (self) -> None : self . store: dict[K, V] = {} def get (self, key: K) -> V: return self . store[key] def set (self, key: K, value: V) -> None : self . store[key] = value kv = KVStore[str, int]() kv . set( \"one\" , 1 ) kv . set( \"two\" , 2 ) kv . set( \"three\" , 3 )\n\nPython 3.5 initially introduced Generics through the TypeVar syntax. However, PEP 695 for Python 3.12 revamped type annotations with native syntax for generics, type aliases, and more.\n\n# OLD SYNTAX - Python 3.5 to 3.11 from typing import Generic, TypeVar UnBounded = TypeVar( \"UnBounded\" ) Bounded = TypeVar( \"Bounded\" , bound = int) Constrained = TypeVar( \"Constrained\" , int, float) class Foo (Generic[UnBounded, Bounded, Constrained]): def __init__ (self, x: UnBounded, y: Bounded, z: Constrained) -> None : self . x = x self . y = y self . z = z\n\n# NEW SYNTAX - Python 3.12+ class Foo [UnBounded, Bounded: int, Constrained: int | float]: def __init__ (self, x: UnBounded, y: Bounded, z: Constrained) -> None : self . x = x self . y = y self . z = z\n\nThis change also introduces an even more powerful version of variadic generics. Meaning you can have an arbitrary number of type parameters for complex data structures and operations.\n\nclass Tuple [ * Ts]: def __init__ (self, * args: * Ts) -> None : self . values = args # Works with any number of types! pair = Tuple[str, int]( \"hello\" , 42 ) triple = Tuple[str, int, bool]( \"world\" , 100 , True )\n\nFinally, as part of the 3.12 typing changes, Python also introduced a new concise syntax for type aliases!\n\n# OLD SYNTAX - Python 3.5 to 3.9 from typing import NewType Vector = NewType( \"Vector\" , list[float])\n\n# OLD-ish SYNTAX - Python 3.10 to 3.11 from typing import TypeAlias Vector: TypeAlias = list[float]\n\n# NEW SYNTAX - Python 3.12+ type Vector = list[float]\n\nIt’s important to note that NewType and TypeAlias (including the new type syntax) are slightly different! NewType creates a subtype that is not equivalent to its base type, whereas TypeAlias assigns an alternative name for an existing type. from typing import TypeAlias type NewInt = int AliasInt: TypeAlias = int NewInt == int # False, not equivalent AliasInt == int # True, equivalent\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n5. Protocols\n\nOne of Python’s major features (and also major complaints) is its support for Duck Typing. There’s a saying that goes:\n\n“If it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.”\n\nHowever, that raises the question: How do you type duck typing?\n\nclass Duck : def quack (self): print( 'Quack!' ) class Person : def quack (self): print( \"I'm quacking!\" ) class Dog : def bark (self): print( 'Woof!' ) def run_quack (obj): obj . quack() run_quack(Duck()) # Works! run_quack(Person()) # Works! run_quack(Dog()) # Fails with AttributeError\n\nThat’s where Protocols come in. Protocols (also known as Structural Subtyping) are typing classes in Python defining the structure or behavior that classes can follow without the use of interfaces or inheritance.\n\nfrom typing import Protocol class Quackable (Protocol): def quack (self) -> None : ... # The ellipsis indicates this is just a method signature class Duck : def quack (self): print( 'Quack!' ) class Dog : def bark (self): print( 'Woof!' ) def run_quack (obj: Quackable): obj . quack() run_quack(Duck()) # Works! run_quack(Dog()) # Fails during TYPE CHECKING (and runtime)\n\nIn essence, Protocols check what your object can do, not what it is. They simply state that as long as an object implements certain methods or behaviors, it qualifies, regardless of its actual type or inheritance.\n\n✨ Additional quick tip: Add the @runtime_checkable decorator if you want isinstance() checks to work alongside your Protocols!\n\n@runtime_checkable class Drawable (Protocol): def draw (self) -> None : ...\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n6. Context Managers\n\nContext Managers are objects that define the methods: __enter__() and __exit__() . The __enter__() method runs when you enter the with block, and the __exit__() method runs when you leave it (even if an exception occurs).\n\nContextlib simplifies this process by wrapping all that boilerplate code in a single easy-to-use decorator.\n\n# OLD SYNTAX - Traditional OOP-style context manager class retry : def __enter__ (self): print( \"Entering Context\" ) def __exit__ (self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb): print( \"Exiting Context\" )\n\n# NEW SYNTAX - New contextlib-based context manager import contextlib @contextlib.contextmanager def retry (): print( \"Entering Context\" ) yield print( \"Exiting Context\" )\n\nTo create your own, write a function with the @contextlib.contextmanager decorator. Add setup code before yield , cleanup code after it. Any variables on yield will be passed in as additional context. That’s it.\n\nThe yield statement instructs the context manager to pause your function and lets content within the with block run.\n\nimport contextlib @contextlib.contextmanager def context (): # Setup code here setup() yield ( ... ) # Any variables you want to be passed to the with block # Teardown code here takedown()\n\nThe real power with contextlib comes from its exception handling and state management. For example, the same logic with this following function:\n\n@contextlib.contextmanager def handle_file (path: str): try : with open(path, 'w' ) as f: f . write( 'Hello, world!' ) yield f f . write( 'Goodbye, world!' ) except Exception as e: raise CustomFileOpenError() from e\n\nUsing raw __enter__ and __exit__ methods would look like this:\n\nclass handle_file : def __init__ (self, path: str): self . path = path self . file = None def __enter__ (self): try : self . file = open(self . path, 'w' ) self . file . write( 'Hello, world!' ) return self . file except Exception as e: raise CustomFileOpenError() from e def __exit__ (self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb): try : # Only write \"Goodbye, world!\" if no exception occurred during the yield if exc_type is None : self . file . write( 'Goodbye, world!' ) finally : if self . file: self . file . close() # Not suppressing any exceptions return None\n\nBoth are functionally identical, but the @contextmanager decorator lets us write more readable and maintainable code by handling all the boilerplate for us.\n\n(No need to deal with exec_type , exec_val , exec_tb , etc!)\n\n✨ Bonus Tip: raise ... from ... is also a neat Python feature that allows you to chain exceptions together! For example, try : raise ValueError () except Exception as e: raise NameError () from e returns an exception like: Traceback (most recent call last): File \"...\", line ..., in ... ValueError The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception: Traceback (most recent call last): File \"...\", line ..., in ... NameError\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n7. Structural Pattern Matching\n\nIntroduced in Python 3.10, Structural Pattern Matching gives Python developers a powerful alternative to traditional conditional logic. At its most basic, the syntax looks like this:\n\nmatch value: case pattern1: # code if value matches pattern1 case pattern2: # code if value matches pattern2 case _: # wildcard case (default)\n\nThe real power comes with destructuring! Match patterns break down complex data structures and extract values in a single step.\n\n# Destructuring and matching tuples match point: case ( 0 , 0 ): return \"Origin\" case ( 0 , y): return f \"Y-axis at { y } \" case (x, 0 ): return f \"X-axis at { x } \" case (x, y): return f \"Point at ( { x } , { y } )\"\n\n# Using OR pattern (|) to match multiple patterns match day: case ( \"Monday\" | \"Tuesday\" | \"Wednesday\" | \"Thursday\" | \"Friday\" ): return \"Weekday\" case \"Saturday\" | \"Sunday\" : return \"Weekend\"\n\n# Guard clauses with inline 'if' statements match temperature: case temp if temp < 0 : return \"Freezing\" case temp if temp < 20 : return \"Cold\" case temp if temp < 30 : return \"Warm\" case _: return \"Hot\"\n\n# Capture entire collections using asterisk (*) match numbers: case [f]: return f \"First: { f } \" case [f, l]: return f \"First: { f } , Last: { l } \" case [f, * m, l]: return f \"First: { f } , Middle: { ', ' . join(m) } , Last: { l } \" case []: return \"Empty list\"\n\nYou can also combine match-case with other Python features like walrus operators to create even more powerful patterns.\n\n# Check if a packet is valid or not packet: list[int] = [ 0x01 , 0x02 , 0x03 , 0x04 , 0x05 , 0x06 , 0x07 ] match packet: case [c1, c2, * data, footer] if ( # Deconstruct packet into header, data, and footer (checksum := c1 + c2) == sum(data) and # Check that the checksum is correct len(data) == footer # Check that the data length is correct ): print( f \"Packet received: { data } (Checksum: { checksum } )\" ) case [c1, c2, * data]: # Failure case where structure is correct but checksum is wrong print( f \"Packet received: { data } (Checksum Failed)\" ) case [_, * __]: # Failure case where packet is too short print( \"Invalid packet length\" ) case []: # Failure case where packet is empty print( \"Empty packet\" ) case _: # Failure case where packet is invalid print( \"Invalid packet\" )\n\nNOTE: This is not the cleanest example, but instead more of a demo to show how you can use match-case with other Python features to create more powerful patterns.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n8. Python Slots\n\nSlots are a way to potentially speed up the creation and access of any Python class.\n\nTLDR: They define a fixed set of attributes for classes, optimizing and speeding up accesses during runtime.\n\nclass Person : __slots__ = ( 'name' , 'age' ) def __init__ (self, name, age): self . name = name self . age = age\n\nUnder the hood, Python classes store instance attributes in an internal dictionary called __dict__ , meaning a hash table lookup is required each time you want to access a value.\n\nIn contrast, __slots__ uses an array-like structure where attributes can be looked up in true O(1) time, bringing a minor overall speed bump to Python.\n\n# Without __slots__ class FooBar : def __init__ (self): self . a = 1 self . b = 2 self . c = 3 f = FooBar() print(f . __dict__) # {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n\n# With __slots__ class FooBar : __slots__ = ( 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ) def __init__ (self): self . a = 1 self . b = 2 self . c = 3 f = FooBar() print(f . __dict__) # AttributeError print(f . __slots__) # ('a', 'b', 'c')\n\nThere is still debate about whether __slots__ is worth using, as it complicates class definitions with very marginal or no performance benefits at all. However, it is a useful tool to have in your arsenal if you ever need it.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n9. Python Nitpicks\n\nThis is not a Python “feature” or “tip” per se, but instead a handful of quick syntax tips to really clean up your Python codebase. As someone who’s seen a lot of Python code.\n\n9.1 For-else statements\n\nIf you ever need to check if a for loop completes without a break, for-else statements are a great way to accomplish this without using a temporary variable.\n\n# ===== Don't write this ===== found_server = False # Keep track of whether we found a server for server in servers: if server . check_availability(): logger . info( f \"Found server: { server } \" ) # Adding some side-effects here primary_server = server found_server = True # Set the flag to True break if not found_server: logger . info( \"No server found. Using backup server.\" ) # Use the backup server if no server was found primary_server = backup_server # Continue execution with whatever server we found deploy_application(primary_server)\n\n# ===== Write this instead ===== for server in servers: if server . check_availability(): logger . info( f \"Found server: { server } \" ) # Adding some side-effects here primary_server = server break else : # Use the backup server if no server was found logger . info( \"No server found. Using backup server.\" ) primary_server = backup_server # Continue execution with whatever server we found deploy_application(primary_server)\n\n9.2 Walrus Operator\n\nIf you need to define and evaluate a variable all in one expression, the Walrus Operator (new in Python 3.8 with PEP 572) is a quick way to accomplish just that.\n\nWalrus operators are really useful for using a value right after checking if it is not None !\n\n# ===== Don't write this ===== response = pattern . search(line) if response: print( 'You pressed:' , response) else : print( 'You pressed nothing' )\n\n# ===== Write this instead ===== if response := pattern . search(line): print( 'You pressed:' , response) else : print( 'You pressed nothing' )\n\n9.3 Short Circuit Evaluation\n\nShort-circuit Evaluation is a shortcut for getting the “next available” or “next truthy” value in a list of expressions. It turns out you can simply chain or statements!\n\n# ===== Don't write this ===== username, full_name, first_name = get_user_info() if username is not None : display_name = username elif full_name is not None : display_name = full_name elif first_name is not None : display_name = first_name else : display_name = \"Anonymous\"\n\n# ===== Write this instead ===== username, full_name, first_name = get_user_info() display_name = username or full_name or first_name or \"Anonymous\"\n\nNOTE: As some readers have pointed out, there are some hidden footguns with evaluating variables as booleans! Empty strings, zeros, and empty lists are all considered “falsy” values, which means you need to be extra careful when checking explicitly for None or 0 . # Zero is considered falsy, so it gets skipped even when it's a valid value user_data = { \"name\" : \"Alice\" , \"age\" : 0 } age = user_data . get( \"age\" ) or \"Unknown\" print( f \"User age: { age } \" ) # \"User age: Unknown\"\n\n9.4 Operator Chaining\n\nFinally, Python lets you chain comparison operators together to shorten up integer range comparisons, making them more readable than the equivalent boolean expressions.\n\n# ===== Don't write this ===== if 0 < x and x < 10 : print( \"x is between 0 and 10\" )\n\n# ===== Write this instead ===== if 0 < x < 10 : # Instead of if 0 < x and x < 10 print( \"x is between 0 and 10\" )\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n10. Advanced f-string String Formatting\n\nPython’s f-strings are no secret by now. Introduced in Python 3.6 with PEP 498, they are a better, cleaner, faster, and safer method of interpolating variables, objects, and expressions into strings.\n\nBut did you know there is more to f-strings than just inserting variables? There exists a hidden formatting syntax called the Format Mini-Language that allows you to have much greater control over string formatting.\n\nprint( f \" { ' [ Run Status ] ' : =^50 } \" ) print( f \"[ { time : %H:%M:%S } ] Training Run { run_id =} status: { progress : .1% } \" ) print( f \"Summary: { total_samples : , } samples processed\" ) print( f \"Accuracy: { accuracy : .4f } | Loss: { loss : #.3g } \" ) print( f \"Memory: { memory / 1e9 : +.2f } GB\" )\n\nOutput:\n\n=================== [ Run Status ] =================== [11:16:37] Training Run run_id=42 status: 87.4% Summary: 12,345,678 samples processed Accuracy: 0.9876 | Loss: 0.0123 Memory: +2.75 GB\n\nYou can do things like enable debug expressions, apply number formatting (similar to str.format ), add string padding, format datetime objects, and more! All within f-string format specifiers.\n\nRegular f-strings\n\nprint( f \"Hello { item } !\" )\n\nHello World!\n\nDebug Expressions\n\nprint( f \" { name =} , { age =} \" )\n\nname='Claude', age=3\n\nNumber Formatting\n\nprint( f \"Pi: { pi : .2f } \" ) print( f \"Avogadro: { avogadro : .2e } \" ) print( f \"Big Number: { big_num : , } \" ) print( f \"Hex: { num : #0x } \" ) print( f \"Number: { num : 09 } \" )\n\nPi: 3.14 Avogadro: 6.02e+23 Big Number: 1,000,000 Hex: 0x1a4 Number: 000000420\n\nString Padding\n\nprint( f \"Left: | { word : <10 } |\" ) print( f \"Right: | { word : >10 } |\" ) print( f \"Center: | { word : ^10 } |\" ) print( f \"Center *: | { word : *^10 } |\" )\n\nLeft: |Python | Right: | Python| Center: | Python | Center *: |**Python**|\n\nprint( f \"Date: { now : %Y-%m-%d } \" ) print( f \"Time: { now : %H:%M:%S } \" )\n\nDate: 2025-03-10 Time: 14:30:59\n\nPercentage Formatting\n\nprint( f \"Progress: { progress : .1% } \" )\n\nProgress: 75.0%\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n11. Cache / lru_cache\n\nYou can use the built-in @cache decorator to dramatically speed up recursive functions and expensive calculations! (which superseded @lru_cache in Python 3.9!)\n\nfrom functools import cache @cache def fib (n): return n if n < 2 else fib(n - 1 ) + fib(n - 2 )\n\nSince Python 3.2, @lru_cache was introduced as part of the functools module for quick & clean function memoization. Starting with Python 3.9, @cache was added for the same effect with less code. lru_cache still exists if you want explicit control of the cache size.\n\nFIB_CACHE = {} # With Manual Caching :( def fib (n): if n in FIB_CACHE: return FIB_CACHE[n] if n <= 2 : return 1 FIB_CACHE[n] = fib(n - 1 ) + fib(n - 2 ) return FIB_CACHE[n]\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache # Same code with lru_cache :) @lru_cache (maxsize = None ) def fib (n): return n if n < 2 else fib(n - 1 ) + fib(n - 2 )\n\nfrom functools import cache # Same code with new Python 3.9's cache :D @cache def fib (n): return n if n < 2 else fib(n - 1 ) + fib(n - 2 )\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n12. Python Futures\n\nDid you know that Python has native Promise -like concurrency control?\n\nfrom concurrent.futures import Future # Manually create a Future Object future = Future() # Set its result whenever you want future . set_result( \"Hello from the future!\" ) # Get the result print(future . result()) # \"Hello from the future!\"\n\nPython’s concurrent.futures module gives you direct control over async operations, just like JS Promises. For example, they let you attach callbacks that run when the result is ready (just like JS’s .then() ).\n\nfrom concurrent.futures import Future future = Future() # Add callbacks BEFORE or AFTER completion! future . add_done_callback( lambda f: print( f \"Got: { f . result() } \" )) future . set_result( \"Async result\" ) # Prints: \"Got: Async result\" future . add_done_callback( lambda f: print( f \"After: { f . result() } \" )) # Prints: \"After: Async result\"\n\nPython Futures also come with primitives to handle exceptions, set timeouts, or stop tasks completely.\n\nfrom concurrent.futures import Future import time , threading # Create and manage a future manually future = Future() # Background task function def background_task (): time . sleep( 2 ) future . set_result( \"Done!\" ) thread = threading . Thread(target = background_task) thread . daemon = True thread . start() # Try all control operations print( f \"Cancelled: { future . cancel() } \" ) # Likely False if started try : # Wait at most 0.5 seconds result = future . result(timeout = 0.5 ) except TimeoutError : print( \"Timed out!\" ) # Create failed future err_future = Future() err_future . set_exception( ValueError ( \"Failed\" )) print( f \"Has error: { bool(err_future . exception()) } \" )\n\nJust like modern JS, the asyncio module has its own Future that works seamlessly with Python’s async/await syntax:\n\nimport asyncio async def main (): future = asyncio . Future() # Set result after delay asyncio . create_task(set_after_delay(future)) # Await just like a JS Promise! result = await future print(result) # \"Worth the wait!\" async def set_after_delay (future): await asyncio . sleep( 1 ) future . set_result( \"Worth the wait!\" ) asyncio . run(main())\n\nFinally, for CPU or I/O bound tasks, Python’s ThreadPoolExecutor can automatically create and manage futures for you.\n\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor import time def slow_task (): time . sleep( 1 ) return \"Done!\" with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor: # Returns a Future immediately future = executor . submit(slow_task) # Do other work while waiting... print( \"Working...\" ) # Get result when needed print(future . result())\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n13. Proxy Properties\n\nDid you know you can make class attributes act as BOTH methods AND properties?!? This isn’t a built-in feature of Python, but instead a demonstration of what you can do with clever use of Python’s dunder (magic) methods and descriptors.\n\n(Note that this is very much an example implementation and should not be used in production)\n\nfrom typing import Callable, Generic, TypeVar, ParamSpec, Self P = ParamSpec( \"P\" ) R = TypeVar( \"R\" ) T = TypeVar( \"T\" ) class ProxyProperty (Generic[P, R]): func: Callable[P, R] instance: object def __init__ (self, func: Callable[P, R]) -> None : self . func = func def __get__ (self, instance: object, _ = None ) -> Self: self . instance = instance return self def __call__ (self, * args: P . args, ** kwargs: P . kwargs) -> R: return self . func(self . instance, * args, ** kwargs) def __repr__ (self) -> str: return self . func(self . instance) def proxy_property (func: Callable[P, R]) -> ProxyProperty[P, R]: return ProxyProperty(func) class Container : @proxy_property def value (self, val: int = 5 ) -> str: return f \"The value is: { val } \" # Example usage c = Container() print(c . value) # Returns: The value is: 5 print(c . value( 7 )) # Returns: The value is: 7\n\nHow does this work under the hood? It comes down to Python’s Descriptor Protocol:\n\nThe __get__ method transforms the ProxyProperty object into a descriptor. When you access c.value , Python calls __get__ which returns self (the descriptor instance). The __repr__ method handles property access (returning default values). The __call__ method handles method calls with parameters.\n\nThis creates a dual-purpose attribute that can be both read directly AND called like a function!\n\nThe benefit of this class is that it allows you to create intuitive APIs where a property might need configuration, or properties that should have sensible defaults but still allow for customization.\n\nIf you want to look at a proper production-ready implementation of proxy properties, check out Codegen’s implementation of ProxyProperty here: codegen/src/codegen/sdk/_proxy.py\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n14. Metaclasses\n\nFinally, introducing one of Python’s most powerful yet mysterious features: Metaclasses\n\nclass MyMetaclass (type): def __new__ (cls, name, bases, namespace): # Magic happens here return super() . __new__ (cls, name, bases, namespace) class MyClass (metaclass = MyMetaclass): pass obj = MyClass()\n\nClasses in Python aren’t just blueprints for objects. They’re objects too! And every object needs a class that created it. So what creates class objects? Metaclasses.\n\nBy default, Python uses the type metaclass to create all classes. For example, these two are equivalent to each other:\n\n# Create a MyClass object class MyClass : ... obj = MyClass() # Also creates a MyClass object obj2 = type( \"MyClass\" , (), {})\n\nTo break down what those arguments mean, here is an example that creates a class with an attribute x and a method say_hi , that also subclasses off object .\n\n# type( # name, # bases, # attributes # ) CustomClass = type( 'CustomClass' , (object,), { 'x' : 5 , 'say_hi' : lambda self: 'Hello!' } ) obj = CustomClass() print(obj . x) # 5 print(obj . say_hi()) # Hello!\n\nIn essence, Metaclasses let you customize and modify these arguments during class creation. For example, here is a metaclass that doubles every integer attribute for a class:\n\nclass DoubleAttrMeta (type): def __new__ (cls, name, bases, namespace): new_namespace = {} for key, val in namespace . items(): if isinstance(val, int): val *= 2 new_namespace[key] = val return super() . __new__ (cls, name, bases, new_namespace) class MyClass (metaclass = DoubleAttrMeta): x = 5 y = 10 print(MyClass . x) # 10 print(MyClass . y) # 20\n\nHere is another example of a metaclass that registers every class created into a registry.\n\n# ===== Metaclass Solution ===== class RegisterMeta (type): registry = [] def __new__ (mcs, name, bases, attrs): cls = super() . __new__ (mcs, name, bases, attrs) mcs . registry . append(cls) return cls\n\nThe problem is, decorators could achieve this same goal without the use of black magic (and it’s often cleaner too).\n\n# ===== Decorator Solution ===== def register (cls): registry . append(cls) return cls @register class MyClass : pass\n\nAnd that kind of brings to light the biggest problem with metaclasses:\n\nAlmost 100% of the time, you will never need to touch them.\n\nIn your day-to-day development, 99% of your code won’t ever hit a use case where metaclasses could be useful. And of that 1%, 95% of those cases could just be solved with regular decorators, dunder methods, or just plain inheritance.\n\nThat’s why there is that one famous Python quote that goes:\n\nMetaclasses are deeper magic than 99% of users should ever worry about. If you wonder whether you need them, you don’t. - Tim Peters\n\nBut if you are that 1% which has a unique enough problem that only metaclasses can solve, they are a powerful tool that lets you tinker with the internals of the Python object system.\n\nAs for some real-world examples of metaclasses: Python’s “ABC” implementation uses metaclasses to implement abstract classes.\n\nPython’s “Enum” implementation uses it to create enumeration types.\n\nA bunch of 3rd party libraries like Django, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Pytest use metaclasses for a variety of purposes.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFin\n\nAnd that’s it folks! 14 of some of the most interesting & underrated Python features that I’ve encountered in my Python career.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, shoot me a quick message as to which ones you’ve seen before and which ones you haven’t! I’d love to hear from you.\n\nHappy Python-ing, y’all 🐍!"}

Staff Sgt. Fred Brown/US Army\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe United States will begin withdrawing hundreds of troops from northeast Syria in coming months, a sign that it believes its Kurdish partners and the new Syrian government can keep ISIS extremists from reorganizing.\n\nThe US troops in Syria have assisted its local partner, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, in the fight against ISIS since 2015. The presence was always relatively small, never exceeding 2,500, and is being reduced to below 1,000.\n\n\"This consolidation reflects the significant steps we have made toward degrading ISIS' appeal and operational capability regionally and globally,\" Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a Friday statement. \"This deliberate and conditions-based process will bring the US footprint in Syria down to less than a thousand US forces in the coming months.\"\n\n\"The US is likely to keep a small residual force in Syria to conduct targeted raids against ISIS,\" Nicholas Heras, senior director of strategy and innovation at the New Lines Institute, told Business Insider. \"The US is also likely to keep the base in Erbil (Iraqi Kurdistan) as a hub to surge forces into Syria, as needed.\"\n\n\"These factors would mean that a phased US withdrawal from Syria would be less likely to be chaotic, and more likely to adhere to a typical reduction in force.\"\n\nIn October 2019, two years after ISIS lost its self-styled caliphate's de-facto capital to the US-led coalition, President Donald Trump ordered an abrupt withdrawal, triggering a brief but destructive and destabilizing cross-border Turkish operation against the SDF. Trump ultimately postponed that hasty withdrawal and the US maintained a smaller deployment of about 900 personnel.\n\nThe latest drawdown takes place under significantly different circumstances.\n\n\"The 2019 withdrawal was so chaotic because it was a snap decision that the US administration wasn't adequately prepared for, and which senior officials in the administration were outraged by,\" Aron Lund, a fellow with Century International and a senior analyst at the Swedish Defense Research Agency, told BI.\n\n\"You don't have that situation today,\" Lund said, adding that, unlike the previous Trump administration, there are no officials who would likely resign in protest as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis did.\n\nIn December, after the overthrow of long-time Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, the US disclosed that it had 2,000 troops in Syria. It clarified that those additional 1,100 were \"temporary rotational forces\" and the remaining 900 \"core\" assets.\n\nSoldiers with the 10th Mountain Division provided security after departing a CH-47 Chinook during air assault training with Syrian partners at Al-Tanf Garrison, Syria, in February. Staff Sgt. Fred Brown/US Army\n\nMyles B. Caggins III, a senior nonresident fellow at the New Lines Institute, retired US Army colonel, and former spokesman for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, believes Washington would be \"well-served\" in continuing its Syria deployment.\n\n\"During the first Trump administration, the US-led global Coalition defeated ISIS by supporting the Kurdish-led SDF,\" Caggins told BI. \"It is important for President Trump to preserve that victory and support the SDF while they continue raids on ISIS remnants and hold 10,000 ISIS detainees.\"\n\n\"The 2,000 US troops in Syria continue to blast and capture ISIS and Hurras al-Din leaders, as well as preventing Iranian-backed militants from having a land bridge to Lebanon and ultimately Israel,\" Caggins said; Hurras al-Din is an al-Qaeda-affiliated group in Syria.\n\nThese continued counter-terrorism efforts coincide with improving relations between Turkey and the SDF. A ceasefire recently ended months of skirmishes between the SDF and Turkey's Syrian militia allies.\n\n\"The situation now in eastern Syria is more fortuitous than it has been before for this type of US reduction of force,\" Heras said.\n\nThe SDF also signed a landmark deal with Damascus in March that will eventually see the SDF integrated into Syria's national armed forces. Until that deal, the US still has a crucial role to play in supporting its Kurdish-led partner.\n\n\"The new transitional Syrian government is not able to fund or staff the ISIS detention centers and Damascus tacitly welcomes the presence of US troops because they know that the well-trained, well-equipped SDF is a critical part of the future composition of the Syrian Ministry of Defense,\" Caggins said.\n\nThousands of ISIS fighters and their families remain in prisons and open-air camps in SDF-held areas. The most notable is the sprawling Al-Hol camp near the Iraqi border in northeast Syria. The camp is an indefinite detention for an estimated 40,000 people, primarily Iraqi and Syrian nationals, many with suspected links or sympathies to ISIS. ISIS prisoners and sleeper cells have attempted to free fellow captives and regroup, most notably in January 2022 through an attempted prison break in Hasaka that took the US-backed Kurdish authorities 10 days to suppress.\n\nEfforts to rehabilitate foreign ISIS fighters at al-Hol are ongoing. So far, an estimated half of Iraqi nationals in the camp have been repatriated, with the majority rehabilitated.\n\nShortly before he returned to the White House in January, Trump said that America should have nothing to do with Syria or its conflict.\n\nCentury International's Lund believes it remains to be seen if \"a more extensive pullout\" of US troops from Syria and Syria's reabsorption of SDF territories and institutions could be smoothly coordinated with Damascus and Ankara.\n\n\"If everyone shows a bit of goodwill, you could have a handover of areas and prisons and other things\" from the US and SDF to the Syrian government, Lund said. \"But if there's not a deal in place when US troops start a final exit, or if there's a deal that doesn't hold up when tested, things could go haywire very quickly.\"\n\n\"Even if we end up with just a partial reduction of forces this time, I believe the United States will probably quit Syria in Trump's second mandate,\" Lund added. \"And if so, it will probably be sooner rather than later.\"\n\nPaul Iddon is a freelance journalist and columnist who writes about Middle East developments, military affairs, politics, and history.

Those claims sit in contrast to comments made by the head of the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU) in a recent interview. Detective Chief Inspector Emma Warbey concedes that people who use pirate devices are largely able to do so \"without risk of arrest.\" That doesn't mean entirely without risk, however.\n\nFor those not directly involved, assessing the effectiveness of an anti-piracy campaign meets significant challenges.\n\nThe results of campaigns are often measured by those behind them, in some cases after receiving significant financial assistance from friendly governments. Whether by coincidence or otherwise, subsequent reports suggesting that everyone wasted their money are impossible to find.\n\nReports of successful campaigns are less scarce but since supporting evidence now amounts to commercially-sensitive corporate information, details showing why the investment paid off tend to be restricted.\n\nEstimating the results of an anti-piracy campaign that strives to increase awareness is much more straightforward. Publicly unencumbered by requirements to decrease piracy while increasing sales, success amounts to more people being aware of the issues than before the campaign launched.\n\nPiracy Awareness At Record Highs in the UK\n\nThe UK’s BeStreamWise anti-piracy campaign has been running since September/October 2023. At launch the campaign was publicly supported by the Federation Against Copyright Theft, the UK government’s Intellectual Property Office, CrimeStoppers, British Association for Screen Entertainment, Sky, the Premier League, the Irish Industry Trust For IP Awareness, and broadcaster ITV.\n\nDuring the months that followed, additional companies and organizations were revealed as backers, including DAZN, BBC, the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit, streaming platforms GAAGO and Clubber, U.S. giant Universal, and the most recent addition, the world-famous Formula 1.\n\nAs things stand that’s already an impressive set of backers but also somewhat understated.\n\nThrough their memberships of FACT and BASE, several major entertainment companies can be added to the list.\n\nThey include The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros., Sony Pictures, Studio Canal, Virgin Media, TNT, Lionsgate, Mattel, and Crunchyroll, to name a few. The overwhelming majority haven’t been publicly associated with the campaign in any way, with FACT shouldering most of the overt press appearances. Commentary provided is regularly attributed to FACT, but not explicitly stated as provided on behalf of the campaign.\n\nIf piracy awareness was the goal, mission accomplished. Awareness of pirate set-top boxes and the possibility of obtaining all media for free is at an all-time high in the UK. Much of the credit for that goes to the tabloid media for their sustained wall-to-wall piracy coverage over the past 18 months.\n\nDivide and Conquer – GENTLY\n\nUnlike many traditional anti-piracy campaigns that demonized suppliers and consumers of pirated content, BeStreamWise launched with emphasis on the risks associated with illegal content consumption, such as malware, credit card fraud, and identity theft.\n\nBy not immediately going to war with those consuming pirated content, the scale of any pushback was naturally limited, and the nightmare scenario of the campaign itself providing the fuel for opposition was effectively eliminated. That theoretically provided BeStreamWise with space to undermine loyalty to pirate suppliers and gently ease consumers back onside against a common adversary.\n\nPerceptions of how things played out will obviously vary. However, of the 27 or so news updates subsequently published on the BeStreamWise portal, just three or four addressed the main theme of the campaign (consumer risk). The overwhelming majority reported on “crackdowns” on illegal IPTV services, raids, arrests, people being fined, imprisoned, and otherwise being held accountable for piracy activities.\n\nThis tends to suggest that warning messages are still perceived as important, if the confrontation they generate can be effectively managed.\n\nBe Polite, Always Credit the Source\n\nThe BeStreamWise campaign’s official work with the media, and the motivation behind hundreds of articles published by the UK tabloids containing exactly the same talking points and overall narrative, show few clear dividing lines. Comments from Sky and the Intellectual Property Office, for example, are notable for their clear attribution, albeit in relatively few articles.\n\nThe individual companies and government departments behind BeStreamWise are known to communicate with the press, but attribution is consistently limited. Commentary from the campaign itself has in many cases gone uncredited in much the same way.\n\nDespite being involved in a major national campaign, the Intellectual Property Office website lacks any public mention of BeStreamWise, while a trawl of its expenditure records reveals no direct references to financial assistance or details of resource allocation. The apparent disconnect seems unusual but considering the sensational and often misleading information churned out in local media, maintaining distance may avoid most of the embarrassing questions.\n\nWarnings Published Regularly in the Media\n\nPersistent media claims that users of pirate set-top boxes face up to a decade of imprisonment, are stated as fact but without attribution. Other distortions implying that police are somewhat routinely knocking on doors in search of people watching illegal streams, after tracking users down with vehicle-based ‘illegal streaming detection technology‘, receive exactly the same treatment.\n\nThese are just two examples of the type of commentary that has run alongside the campaign, in articles that mention the campaign and others that don’t. These claims are never directly linked to the campaign and that may be for good reason, i.e the campaign was not the source. Unfortunately, citing sources is extremely rare; corrections rarer still.\n\nStatements similar to the above often appear in articles that unhelpfully conflate, or fail to differentiate between, action against suppliers and sellers of pirate streams, and the alleged threat of action against consumers of pirated content. We’ve highlighted this problem several times before, including directly, but to no avail.\n\nInterestingly, confirmation that users are unlikely to face arrest arrived just a few days ago, in an article mentioning the BeStreamWise campaign where the source was actually cited.\n\nIndividuals Largely Use ‘Illegal Fire Sticks’ “Without Any Risk of Arrest”\n\nPublished in the Financial Times behind a paywall, the article’s headline speaks volumes. “Number of UK consumers streaming sports illegally has gone ‘through the roof’, police say” is the last thing rightsholders want to hear, but nonetheless typical of recent dreary assessments concerning the fight against piracy.\n\nThe article centers on an interview with Detective Chief Inspector Emma Warbey, the head of the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit at City of London Police. For the sake of clarity, the introduction and one additional paragraph are reproduced verbatim below.\n\nThe number of people who stream sports or other channels illegally in the UK has gone “through the roof” — straining already-stretched police forces in their efforts to prosecute consumers who flout the law, the head of Britain’s intellectual property crime unit has said. Emma Warbey, detective chief inspector and head of the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit at the City of London Police, admitted individuals were largely able to use “broken” illegal fire sticks without risk of arrest by her team as officers targeted organized crime groups and resellers at the head of such schemes.\n\n————–\n\nWarbey said it would be wrong to conclude that using illegal streams to watch sports and other paid TV content was a risk-free way of watching media, pointing to fraud and funding for organized crime gangs. She said her team had focused efforts on tackling “resellers and the people at the top of the tree” given that “it’s really hard to stop people doing it”. She added: “We always follow the money and go for the bigger organized crime groups and the bigger organized crime networks.”\n\n\n\nThe suggestion by the FT that consumers may have been at least considered for potential arrest is not especially surprising, but still falls way short of the scenarios suggested in the media.\n\nThe reality that police don’t have the necessary resources to pursue individual consumers is not surprising at all, but it would’ve been very effective at fueling the type of opposition BeStreamWise has largely avoided.\n\nWhat happens should the more gentle approach be considered ineffective, is the same unanswered question repeated several times annually for the last 25 years."}

But if you don’t?\n\nThen, you’ve got a bunch of tactics to gain earned media value without paying for every mention. Here’s where your whole team will help you gain EMV.\n\nIn this article, I’ll break down what EMV is, why EMV isn’t just your marketing team’s concern, how to calculate EMV to prove its impact, and real-world examples of brands doing it right.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is earned media value?\n\nEarned media value (EMV) is the estimated dollar worth of all the publicity your brand gets — without paying for ads. It’s free exposure from media coverage, social media mentions, shares, and good old-fashioned word-of-mouth.\n\nEMV is usually calculated by comparing it to the cost of running ads with the same reach and impact. In other words, how much would you have to spend on advertising to get the same level of attention?\n\nEarned Media Value Calculator This interactive EMV Calculator equips marketers with the insights needed to track engagement, conversions, and revenue impact.

Guest blogging and podcasts: Being invited to share your expertise on external platforms to tap into new audiences.\n\nBeing invited to share your expertise on external platforms to tap into new audiences. Awards and recognitions: Industry accolades that increase your brand’s credibility and authority.\n\nIn short, EMV happens when people talk about your brand because they want to — not because you paid them. It’s real influence, not rented space.\n\nWhy should your team know your earned media value?\n\nEarned media isn’t just a vanity metric. It’s an indicator of brand trust, customer engagement, and marketing effectiveness.\n\nHere’s why your team needs to track and understand it.\n\nBuilds brand authority and trust.\n\nEarned media builds the strongest trust between a brand and its audience. When a brand’s message comes from a third party, it instantly feels more credible.\n\nCostco is a great example of a company that makes the most of earned media. Its high-quality Signature Select products and dedication to its $1.50 hot dog combo have bred brand loyalty. You may have heard of the Costco guys, a father-and-son duo that reviews the company’s products. My personal favorite is the band The Never Ending Fall’s series, “Can It Kirkland?” In each video, they compare name-brand and Coscto-brand alcohol.\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@neverendingfall/video/7461072017937157422?lang=en\n\nActually, Costco doesn’t spend on advertising. Instead, the company relies heavily on earned media and word of mouth, leading to a brand value of $48.3 billion in 2024.\n\nBoosts visibility and referrals.\n\nThanks to EMV, your brand spreads naturally through shares, organic mentions, and referrals. For instance, 14.28% of Coca-Cola’s traffic comes from referrals only.\n\nIn fact, Facebook alone accounts for 51.23% of Coca-Cola’s total social media referrals, highlighting the impact of organic reach on brand visibility.\n\nSource\n\nBut how does it work for smaller brands?\n\nI talked to Mia Jozipović, content and marketing strategist for Siterice.hr. She recently pulled off a great PR campaign and shares her tips:\n\n\"We ran a study using data from our platform on the average costs of childcare, pet care, and cleaning services in Croatia for 2025. I sent the data to media outlets I thought would find it interesting, and it led to tons of PR articles — completely free,” she said.\n\n“For example, Net.hr and Lider Media — some of Croatia’s biggest sites gave us free media coverage. Did we deserve it? Absolutely! I gave them something juicy they simply could not resist.”\n\nThis case means your analysts or coders have to roll up their sleeves and aid marketing folks in preparing research. Most importantly, they have to understand the “why” and its business impact.\n\nImproves strategy and budget allocation.\n\nTracking EMV data means understanding what’s working and where to adjust. The right platforms, content types, and influencers can drive serious value, but without a clear measurement strategy, it’s easy to misallocate resources.\n\nOlivia Tian, marketing and innovation manager at Raise 3D, an industrial 3D printing company, shared a great example of this in action.\n\nShe told me about a product launch where they heavily relied on PR and assumed media coverage alone would generate conversions. While they secured solid placements, engagement stalled.\n\nNext, she amplified it through LinkedIn thought leadership posts, nurtured it via email marketing and integrated it into sales enablement materials.\n\nThis one adjustment — embedding media mentions into outbound sales efforts — led to a 30% increase in email response rates.\n\nTian wraps it up by saying:\n\n“Don't just chase PR wins — ensure earned media is woven into your broader marketing and sales funnel for long-term impact.”\n\nThe lesson: EMV campaigns include salespeople, too, to spread the word.\n\nThe Earned Media Value Formula\n\nEMV helps brands put a dollar amount on unpaid publicity. While there’s no single standard formula, marketers generally calculate it by estimating how much they would have spent on ads to get the same reach and engagement.\n\nThe basic EMV formula is:\n\nTotal Impressions — Includes views from social media, press coverage, influencer mentions, and user-generated content. CPM for Paid Ads — Look at industry benchmarks or your past campaigns to see how much brands typically pay per 1,000 impressions in your space. Multiply Impressions by CPM — Gives you an estimated dollar value of what your earned media exposure would cost if it were paid advertising.\n\nAlternative Ways to Measure EMV\n\nSometimes, you can tweak the formula to make it more accurate depending on the channel and engagement metrics. Here are a few other approaches:\n\n1. Engagement-Based EMV Formula\n\nSince impressions alone don’t show true impact, some marketers factor in engagement (likes, shares, comments) to get a more accurate value:\n\nCPE (Cost per Engagement) represents the average cost of a like, share, or comment in paid media campaigns.\n\n2. PR Value Formula\n\nFor press coverage, PR teams often use an Advertising Value Equivalency (AVE) model:\n\nThis works well for traditional media (newspapers, magazines) by estimating what it would cost to buy that same amount of space in ad form.\n\nMultiply it by a credibility factor (typically 2-5x).\n\n3. Influencer EMV Formula\n\nFor influencer partnerships, brands usually calculate EMV using engagement rates and influencer pricing models:\n\nCPE (Cost per Engagement) and CPV (Cost per View) vary by industry and influencer tier.\n\n“Our most successful EMV campaign involved partnering with micro-influencers in our niche who created authentic content showcasing our product. We calculated impact using: (Estimated Advertising Value) x (Quality Multiplier) x (Engagement Rate),” says Lisa Benson, marketing strategist at DeBella DeBall Designs.\n\n“For example, a post reaching 10,000 people in our target audience with high engagement would be calculated as: (Cost for equivalent paid reach) x (1.5 for positive sentiment) x (engagement rate of 6%). This formula helped us demonstrate that earned coverage was delivering 3x the value of our paid channels,” Benson said.\n\nEarned Media Value Calculator This interactive EMV Calculator equips marketers with the insights needed to track engagement, conversions, and revenue impact.

UGC EMV Formula\n\nFor user-generated content, you can calculate EMV based on engagement and reach:\n\nNatalia Lavrenenko, UGC manager at Rathly, offers her way to calculate UGC impact and shares tips for result-driven campaigns.\n\n“High engagement beats high follower count every time. Before launching, test different creators with small-budget activations to see who actually converts. One campaign stood out by turning UGC into brand momentum,” she said.\n\n“A giveaway encouraged customers to share their experiences, leading to thousands of organic posts. EMV was calculated using: (Total Mentions x Average CPM) + (Engagements x Value per Interaction) = Earned Media Value.”\n\nWhich EMV formula should you use?\n\nIt depends on your brand’s goals:\n\nFor social media: Engagement-based EMV works best.\n\nFor PR and press coverage: AVE gives a solid estimate.\n\nFor influencer marketing: Use engagement + view-based EMV.\n\nWhile EMV isn’t a perfect science, tracking it helps brands understand the real impact of organic buzz. Choose a formula that aligns with your strategy and tweak it as you gather more data.\n\nPro tip: HubSpot’s free Paid Media Template helps you track and organize media placements across channels like paid search, social media, TV, and more. Easily calculate metrics like CPC, CPM, CPA, and ROAS, while analyzing performance to see which channels deliver the best results for your business.\n\nEarned Media Value in Action\n\nLet’s get practical and walk you through a made-up example of an EMV campaign from the very beginning.\n\nScenario: A marketing manager tasked to attract new gym visitors for an indoor rock climbing gym. They need to create a viral campaign that will be lifted by pros and newbies and local sports news for free.\n\nImplementation: The gym hosts a special event where a 10-year-old climber completes a challenging route meant for pros. A spectator records the moment and posts it on Instagram and TikTok, tagging the climbing gym. The video gains:\n\n1.5 million views.\n\n75K likes.\n\n4K shares.\n\n800 comments.\n\nThe marketing manager takes it to local news and a national sports magazine. They agree to post the story for free, which triggers an avalanche of fitness bloggers picking up the story — all without the gym spending a dime on ads.\n\nEMV Calculations\n\nHere, we use the formula :\n\nEMV = (Impressions × CPM) + (Engagements × CPE)\n\nWhere:\n\nCPM (Cost per 1,000 impressions) = $8 (industry average for fitness ads)\n\n(industry average for fitness ads) CPE (Cost per engagement) = $0.40\n\nApplying the Formula\n\n1. Impressions Value\n\n(1,500,000÷1,000)×8=12,000\n\n2. Engagement Value\n\n(75,000+4,000+800)×0.40=31,120\n\n3. Total Earned Media Value\n\n12,000+31,120=43,120\n\nThis means that the final EMV accounts for $43,120 worth of exposure.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nIf the marketing manager chose paid ads to attract new leads and gain exposure, they would’ve needed a significant budget to reach the same audience.\n\nAnd to be honest, I can hardly imagine the climbing gym investing over $43K in paid ads in one month.\n\n3 Examples of Earned Media Value\n\nNow that we know what EMV is and how to calculate it, let’s check out a few brands that really know how to make the most of it.\n\n1. How did the Barbie movie spark organic buzz?\n\nThe marketing campaign for the Barbie movie, released in 2023, became a standout example of earned media success.\n\nWarner Bros created an immersive and catchy campaign, including the “Barbiecore” aesthetic that dominated social media platforms (TikTok and Instagram especially).\n\nSource\n\nThe campaign sparked organic conversations, with influencers and fans sharing their own Barbie-inspired outfits, memes, and experiences. This led to an avalanche of free publicity across social media, news outlets, and pop culture discussions.\n\nWhy I like it: The campaign blended nostalgia with modern trends, encouraging UGC content that extended its reach far beyond paid ads. It shows how aligning your brand with cultural moments can create a massive earned media impact.\n\n2. How does Duolingo turn trends into attention?\n\nTo follow up on the Barbie trend, I can’t skip mentioning Duolingo's perfect timing with their owl mascot, who transformed into Margot Robbie. Duolingo made a splash with a pre-film ad inspired by Barbie and a presence at a movie premiere in LA:\n\nIt didn’t just turn out bold but resulted in tons of likes and comments, with some of the most popular media outlets and influencers making stitches of these videos, giving Duolingo even more exposure.\n\nSource\n\nIn fact, Duolingo’s TikTok has become a masterclass in viral content, consistently generating earned media. Their owl mascot, featured in funny and relatable videos, regularly racks up millions of views and shares.\n\nWhy I like it: Duolingo proves that even tech brands can humanize themselves through humor and relatability. And by jumping on trends at the right time, they get noticed by influencers and media.\n\n3. How does Semrush amplify its event reach organically?\n\nGlobal Marketing Day, hosted by Semrush, is a 24-hour online marketing conference that brings together top experts from major brands like Google, TikTok, Pinterest, and Vogue Business.\n\nThe event streams live from studios in New York, London, and Dubai, offering 48 sessions on topics like SEO, branding, AI, and more.\n\nSemrush generated social media buzz and UGC content throughout the event, earning media exposure across different platforms.\n\nSource\n\nThe results from the 2023 conference speak for themselves:\n\nReached over 5 million people across all posts.\n\nGenerated 2,700 tweets with #globalmarketingday.\n\nAttracted 90,000 registrants.\n\nSecured 55,000+ leads.\n\nWhy I like it: When you invite experts from different companies, you’re pretty much guaranteed a lot of shares from their teams and connections. A snowball effect — more shares, less effort. Word of mouth takes over.\n\nAlso, by inviting SMEs, Semrush shows they’re not just throwing an event, they’re solidifying their spot as a leader in digital marketing education.\n\nDon’t Buy Attention — Earn It\n\nIs it easier to get a mention when you pay? Yes. But is it more valuable? No.\n\nPaid mentions can bring quick results or flop, but the real value lies in EMV. Every brand should aim for a long-term game — great content and smart promotion on their own end to make the media or an influencer notice them.\n\nGet these things right, media attention comes naturally.\n\nMonitor the value of organic mentions. Use AI to track brand mentions, and never forget to thank the media that featured you.\n\nBuild those relationships. Earn that attention, nurture it, and watch it compound."}

(1:52)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2025 WNBA draft is in the books, and starting next month we'll find out how those players adapt to the league. But it's not too early to examine next season's college senior class to see who might be in the mix for being selected in the first round of the 2026 draft.\n\nIn the past four drafts, the No. 1 pick seemed certain throughout the women's college basketball season: guard Rhyne Howard (2022), forward/center Aliyah Boston (2023), guard Caitlin Clark (2024) and guard Paige Bueckers (2025). The Atlanta Dream's Howard and the Indiana Fever's Boston and Clark were all selected as WNBA rookie of the year, an honor Bueckers is favored to win this season.\n\nFor 2026, a center is projected to go No. 1. But some top-notch guards will be in the mix, too. For this list, we're ranking only players who will be designated as seniors/grad students in the 2025-26 college season. The draft, as always, could include overseas players and draft-eligible juniors.\n\nThe WNBA, which grows to 13 teams this season with the expansion Golden State Valkyries, will expand to 15 teams in 2026 as Toronto and Portland join the league. Here is a look at the top 15 senior college prospects.\n\nUCLA Bruins | C | 6-7\n\n2024-25 stats: 20.2 PPG, 9.5 RPG, 2.9 BPG, 64.8% FG\n\nBetts' junior season was a breakthrough for her and the Bruins, who went to the Final Four for the first time in the NCAA era and won the Big Ten tournament title in their first year in that league. Betts' offensive and defensive skills as a true center will be valued in the WNBA.\n\nUConn Huskies | SG | 5-11\n\n2024-25 stats: 13.6 PPG, 2.0 RPG, 1.8 APG, 43.6% 3FG\n\nFudd was the Final Four Most Outstanding Player after totaling 43 points on 55.2% shooting in UConn's victories over UCLA and South Carolina to win the NCAA title in Tampa. Injuries are the only thing that have held back Fudd, but she's coming off a healthy season.\n\nTCU Horned Frogs | PG | 5-10\n\n2024-25 stats: 15.4 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 5.8 APG, 40.6% 3FG\n\nMiles started every game in 2024-25 for Notre Dame, her final season in South Bend. After losing to TCU in the Sweet 16, Miles transferred to join the Horned Frogs. Her elite passing and shooting are at pro level. She will look to improve defensively in her last year in college.\n\nSouth Carolina Gamecocks | SG | 5-8\n\n2024-25 stats: 25.2 PPG, 4.6 RPG, 4.6 APG\n\nLatson led Division I in scoring average in her last season at Florida State. Next season, she will finish her college career at South Carolina, which has been one of the country's deepest teams the past few seasons, and we'll see how that impacts her statistics. Latson can create offense out of nothing, but WNBA teams will want to see more 3-point success. She had 37 treys last season and 102 over three years, shooting 32.6% from behind the arc for her career.\n\nLSU Tigers | SG | 5-10\n\n2024-25 stats: 18.6 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 2.5 APG\n\nJohnson was the Tigers' second-leading scorer with a career-best average as a junior. Her 3-point shooting percentage (38.3), made 3-pointers (49) and free throw percentage (81.0) also were career highs, and she was first-team All-SEC.\n\nDuke Blue Devils | SG | 6-0\n\n2024-25 stats: 12.4 PPG, 2.4 RPG, 2.1 APG, 37.2% 3FG\n\nPlay Fantasy Women's Basketball Fantasy Women's Basketball is now open! Create or join a league today to get started. • Sign up for free!\n\nDuke made South Carolina sweat out an Elite Eight victory thanks largely to the Blue Devils' defense. Jackson plays that defense at a high level and still made 87 3-pointers this past season, which ranked third in the ACC. That should stand out to WNBA scouts. Jackson will look to improve her 2-point shooting percentage, which is also 37.2.\n\nOle Miss Rebels | SF | 6-0\n\n2024-25 stats: 16.5 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 2.1 APG, 37.4% 3FG\n\nMcMahon's scoring average, 3-point percentage and made 3-pointers (34) were career bests in her third season at Ohio State, which ended with an upset loss at home to Tennessee in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Now McMahon will play her final year with the Rebels. More 3-pointers and a better free throw percentage (64.7 for her career) are things to work on.\n\nTBA | C | 6-4\n\n2024-25 stats: 19.2 PPG, 9.8 RPG, 2.4 APG, 2.3 BPG\n\nWilliams has been under the radar for three seasons with the Wisconsin Badgers, who haven't had a winning record since 2011. Her profile should change dramatically if she transfers to one of the country's top programs as expected. Williams was the Big Ten's defensive player of the year in 2024 and named to the All-Big Ten first team the past two seasons.\n\nTBA | SG | 5-11\n\n2024-25 stats: 19.3 PPG, 5.0 RPG, 3.0 APG\n\nKneepkens made 94 3-pointers this past season at Utah and is one of the most sought-after pure shooters in the transfer portal. She shot 50.4%. from 2-point range this season, as well as nearly 45% from behind the arc. She made the All-Big 12 first team in Utah's first season in the league.\n\nSouth Carolina Gamecocks | PF | 6-2\n\n2024-25 stats: 10.2 PPG, 7.7 RPG, 1.9 APG\n\nThe past year was Kitts' best overall, especially with how well she played in the postseason as MVP of the SEC tournament and Birmingham Regional 2. She also started to make some progress as a 3-point shooter (she hit seven), which will help her WNBA profile.\n\nMaryland Terrapins | SG | 6-3\n\n2024-25 stats: 14.4 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 3.2 APG, 40.7% 3FG\n\nIn Garzon's three-season Indiana career, she shot 42.6% from behind the arc and hit 220 3-pointers, including 88 this past year. She has transferred to Maryland to complete her college career and stands out as a pro prospect for being such a good perimeter shooter at her height.\n\nOklahoma Sooners | C | 6-4\n\n2024-25 stats: 17.3 PPG, 9.4 RPG, 1.2 BPG, 63.3% FG"}

President John F. Kennedy effectively launched the program in 1961 with the help of a special assistant of his own, George McGovern. Within a year, it was feeding tens of millions of children around the world. The press generally regarded it as one of the Kennedy administration’s more impressive achievements.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThough some Republicans have critiqued foreign aid as wasteful, the Food for Peace initiative vividly illustrated how foreign aid can do incalculable humanitarian good, while helping the American economy and advancing U.S. foreign policy goals. In the late 1950s, as a young congressman, McGovern had been a critic of foreign aid, albeit for reasons much different than those espoused today. For every dollar the U.S. spent on economic assistance in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, he pointed out, it spent $10 on military aid. The spending disparity ignored the circumstances of many of the countries receiving this aid: people did not have enough to eat, and rates of illiteracy were as high as 90%. For McGovern, the test for any program of foreign aid should be \"how effectively it enables the people of the underdeveloped areas to build up the kind of society where better standards of life are possible.\"\n\nThis philosophy made McGovern a champion of Public Law 480, enacted under Dwight Eisenhower, in 1954, to reduce America's ruinous postwar agricultural surpluses by distributing them overseas. Critics branded PL 480 a clumsy Republican “dumping program,” one without any overt humanitarian mission, intended only to pacify electorally important farm states. McGovern saw things much differently. Instead of spending $1 billion annually to store surplus grain, he wanted to use PL-480 to feed more of the world's hungry. Doing so would raise “living standards” and promote “peace and stability in the free world\" he argued before Congress. McGovern and Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey turned his proposal into the “Food for Peace” Act, which Congress passed in 1959. Read More: Inside the Chaos, Confusion, and Heartbreak of Trump's Foreign-Aid Freeze Like many Republicans in the 1950s, Kennedy initially saw Food for Peace through a political lens, as a partial solution to the “farm problem” which he could not ignore it during the close 1960 campaign. McGovern, who was running for Senate in South Dakota, helped him find his voice, explaining the dynamic connection between the domestic issue and foreign policy. Under McGovern’s tutelage, the candidate played on the theme whenever he traveled to farm states.\n\nFor example, to thousands of cheering South Dakotans in McGovern's hometown of Mitchell, Kennedy declared the agricultural surplus “an opportunity.\" No group could do more for the country than farmers if Americans “recognize that food is strength” that gave the U.S. the power to win “good will and friendship” from people around the world Kennedy told the crowd. Kennedy won a narrow victory, but McGovern lost his race for the Senate. The President-elect admired the South Dakotan’s agricultural expertise and his distinguished record as a B-24 bomber pilot in World War II and appointed him the first Director of Food for Peace. McGovern set out to turn the program into a bona fide progressive instrument of foreign policy by burying the old “surplus disposal” concept and dramatically increasing the volume of food distributed through a variety of initiatives. For example, he marshaled allotments of millions of tons of surplus American food and fiber to fuel labor-intensive economic development projects in a “food for wages” program. In 22 underdeveloped countries, Food for Peace provided partial wage payments for over 700,000 workers engaged in land clearance, irrigation, reforestation, and the construction of roads, schools, hospitals, and agricultural cooperatives. (Workers received food not only for themselves but for their families as well.) For McGovern, this was the way to fight the Cold War—by improving the nutritional health of many millions of people while launching essential public works projects that otherwise might have gone undone.\n\nDearest to his heart, however, was the overseas school lunch program, which he worked tirelessly to expand in 17 countries, including Cold War hotspots like South Korea and South Vietnam. Feeding hungry school children did enormous good; it resulted in striking improvements in school attendance (often by 40 and 50%) and in the health of tens of millions of malnourished children. Pre-schoolers and nursing mothers often came at lunchtime, too. In 1962, McGovern arrived in Bombay to deliver the 14 millionth ton of wheat to India. One out of five Indian school children then received a Food for Peace lunch every day. The children, Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith remarked at the event, “are better fed and better read as a result of this progressive vision.” McGovern had masterminded the greatest humanitarian achievement of the Kennedy-Johnson era; but it was one that also came with substantial economic and political benefits for the U.S. In recounting to farm audiences the successes of Food for Peace, McGovern highlighted the practical advantages: it absorbed surpluses, saved millions of dollars in storage costs, and, because American ships carried half of all the exported commodities, it benefitted the merchant marine as well. Further, the program served a Cold War purpose: the abundance produced by American farmers alleviated the worst kinds of human suffering that had spawned tyranny abroad. It was “our most constructive instrument of foreign policy,” McGovern would tell audiences. “American food has done more to prevent communism than all the military hardware we’ve shipped around the world.”\n\nThis meant that America's rural heartland was now a force in foreign policy. Indeed, “America could make its greatest contribution to world peace by fully utilizing our agricultural abundance,” said McGovern. He often reminded farmers that they composed just 8% of the U.S. population, yet they produced a volume of commodities five times greater than did their counterparts in Russia who made up nearly half of its labor force. “Marx,” he liked to say, \"was a city boy.\" Read More: I Came to Congress to Gut Foreign Aid. I Was Wrong This experience would have a lasting impact on McGovern’s thinking about the ways powerful nations might figure in the life of weaker nations. He went on to help establish the World Food Program in 1961. Though he won a Senate race in 1962, he never forgot the lessons of Food for Peace. What today we call “food security” became his top domestic priority. In 1968 he launched the first serious investigation of the scope of hunger and malnutrition in America, which resulted in a major expansion of the school lunch program; in 1971, he worked with Kansas Republican Senator Robert Dole to quadruple the number of families who could qualify for Food Stamps, thus (for the while) nearly eradicating hunger in America.\n\nMcGovern is best remembered today for his prescient opposition to the Vietnam War and his landslide loss in the 1972 presidential election. But he was also the statesman who, according to Robert F. Kennedy, “almost single-handedly” transformed a mere surplus distribution venture and made it “mean something around the rest of the world.” President Kennedy did not exaggerate when he stated proudly in 1962, “Food for Peace has become a vital force in the world.” In the decades since, Congress has continued to reauthorize the program with an emphasis on international food security in the underdeveloped world. Legislators also recognized that it advanced the economic standing of American farmers and the country’s foreign policy goals. It remained, in Kennedy’s words, “a vital force” and the enlightened instrument of practical idealism that McGovern had crafted. As of February 2025, Food for Peace had fed upwards of some four billion people around the world.\n\nIn light of the Trump administration’s approach to foreign aid, Americans today would do well to recall McGovern’s legacy. For it demonstrates how foreign aid can have political and economic benefits while also accomplishing undeniable good. The history of Food for Peace exemplifies the value of internationalism and humanitarian endeavors in the making of American foreign policy.\n\nThomas J.

The company has suffered nightmarish processor woes, been eliminated from the dedicated graphics card market, and, to add insult to injury, laid off 15,000 employees last year. Unfortunately, those layoffs weren’t the end of it and more appear to be in store for the company.\n\nBloomberg reports that Intel plans to lay off another 21,000 employees, or about 20 percent of its entire workforce. The company is expected to announce the layoffs later this week.\n\nIntel’s newly appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan—who came on in March 2025, replacing Pat Gelsinger after he stepped down in December 2024—aims to streamline management and rebuild a work culture that’s focused on technology and engineering, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTan said all the right things when he made his opening statements as Intel’s new chief executive last month, asking for “brutal honesty” while promising to “turn things around” and capping it all off with a bold claim: “I will make it perfect.” As devastating as it is for a company to slash a fifth of its workforce, we can only wait and see if this move is what Intel needs to re-establish itself and make a much-needed comeback."}

The players have also been optimized to run off a TV’s USB power port (a USB-C to USB-A cable is included).\n\nWith each player measuring 3.7 x 0.8 x 0.45 inches and weighing in at just 0.9 ounces, the HD-only Streaming Stick ($29.95) and 4K-enabled Streaming Stick Plus ($39.99) replace the Roku Express and Roku Express 4K respectively.\n\nThat leaves just five players in Roku’s streaming lineup, including the Streaming Stick 4K (which adds Dolby Vision HDR, as the newer Streaming Stick Plus supports only HDR10), the high-end Roku Ultra (which offers ethernet and a backlit remote), and the Streambar SE soundbar.\n\nBoth the Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus will ship with Roku’s Voice Remote, allowing you to navigate the players’ streaming interfaces as well as control basic TV functions with your voice. That’s a step up from Roku’s now-legacy Express player, which included just a standard Roku remote.\n\nThe new Roku Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus both ship with Roku’s Voice Remote. Ben Patterson/Foundry\n\nThe new streaming players support dual-band Wi-Fi connectivity and Apple AirPlay casting, typical for Roku’s compact streaming sticks. Neither device offers native Dolby Atmos support, but they will pass through Dolby audio, including Atmos, to an Atmos-capable TV or A/V receiver.\n\nBoth the Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick Plus are available for pre-order now, and are slated to ship May 6.\n\nRoku made some other home-entertainment announcements during its New York press event, including the introduction of mini-LED backlighting for its step-down Roku Plus Series TVs.\n\nThe Plus Series is also getting the scene-by-scene Smart Picture Max image enhancement mode that previously debuted with its high-end Roku Pro Series TVs, along with an integrated remote finder button and cable management channels. Expect the new sets to arrive in the “coming months.”\n\nWe can also expect Roku to land on even bigger screens, with the company announcing the release of a design specification that third-party manufacturers can use to build Roku-branded portable video projectors. More details on Roku’s projector plans will be coming soon, Roku said.\n\nThis news story is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best media streamers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Roku OS is getting a “Coming Soon to Theaters” row featuring in-cinema releases that you can add to your “save” list, along with short-form content rows in the All Things Food and All Things Home hubs, plus “award-winning” badges for video titles.\n\nAlso coming to the Roku OS is a personalized highlights row for sports fans as well as notifications for favorite teams.\n\nIn the smart home arena, Roku unveiled a pair of new battery-powered security cameras. We’ll have a report on those shortly."}

As of now, the list of sites that support it remains small and almost non-existent.\n\nThe new picture-in-picture feature is currently available for beta testing in the Canary version of Chrome.

But what does it really mean to build one—and what does it take to make it last? More importantly, how can businesses create communities that drive long-term success?\n\nMatt Mullenweg, founder and CEO of Automattic—the company behind WordPress—joins HBR IdeaCast host Sarah Green Carmichael to answer those questions. He shares insights on fostering community within a firm—like hiring the right people through auditions instead of resumes—and within a customer base, by encouraging engagement and feedback.\n\nHere’s Mullenweg explaining why what’s good for his customers and contributors is good for his company.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: For me, it all starts with community. That’s really the beginning– the alpha and the omega. Everything that has been successful for WordPress in the past– and everything for Automattic– has really been part of thinking about what’s the best long-term answer for the wider– I don’t want to say community 10 times– but for the wider audience, people that are part of the ecosystem that makes up WordPress users and developers and the creators and all those sorts of folks.\n\nI do truly believe that working in their best interest is in the best commercial interest of the company long term. Maybe in the short term you make less money, and that might frustrate some of our investors or something. But in the long term, I think you’re much healthier and better off.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: That’s interesting. So there’s obviously the community of people who use WordPress, which has grown really, really fast and is huge. And then there’s the core community of people, I think, within WordPress– what you might call employees– which has maybe grown a little bit more.\n\nI saw an interview with you last year where you were saying you were taking the brakes off and hiring more people.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: I’m trying to grow the user base as fast as possible. And I’m trying to grow the employee base as fast as possible, but while still maintaining our culture.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: So how do you do that?\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: I think it’s just a rate. If you look around the room, how many people have been there more than a year, and how many people have been there less than a year? It’s also, what example are the people who have been there longer setting?\n\nBecause essentially what you’re saying– especially if someone’s been there five or 10 years– this person is good. They haven’t been fired. So they are demonstrating what it means to be a part of this organization.\n\nSo if you’re at a company dinner and they go and they order the most expensive thing on the menu and an expensive bottle of wine and then they expense it, that’s going to tell you something about the values of the company and what’s the behavior that’s OK.\n\nSo I don’t think culture has anything to do with ping-pong tables or any of that stuff, especially since we don’t have them here. Those people are not in our office. It’s really the culmination of 1,000 little decisions and actions that people see and then they emulate. And that starts from the very, very top.\n\nIf you’re the CEO or a founder and you walk by a piece of trash on the floor and you don’t pick it up, you know what, everyone else is going to too.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Well, and I’m glad that you mentioned your– what we at HBR would maybe a bit formally call a distributed workforce. You are famous at Automattic for having people scattered all over the world and not for putting a premium on– oh, we all have to be in the same city working together. Tell me a little bit about how that informs your decisions around building the company culture and that kind of thing. I mean, your example [INAUDIBLE] walking through the office, maybe picking up a piece of trash– what’s the digital, distributed, virtual world equivalent of that?\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: It’s funny because our designers actually do something– they call it trash pick-up day. They literally go around all of our products and look for things that are just out of alignment or where the colors aren’t right or the typography isn’t well. And they just do little fixes. Generally it takes less than half an hour or 20 minutes. But, yeah, they call it trash pick-up.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: That’s interesting. So just to sort of finish this interesting company culture jag that we’ve been on– I know one of the things that you have talked about is hiring by auditions rather than resumes. And I’m just wondering, is that something you’ve been able to keep doing as you’ve hired more people? And if so, do you use that to not only see how their work product turns out, but also to see how will this person contribute to the culture that we’ve built?\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: Absolutely. In fact, I still to this day refer people to the HBR article.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Yay!\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: It’s actually still totally accurate. The only thing that’s changed is the numbers. We’re now 390 people. In the article I feel like we were sub 200.\n\nSo it’s working. It’s scaling. And in fact, the more trials we do, the more times we run the process, I feel like the more people learn about it and the better they get.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: That’s great. That’s wonderful to hear.\n\nI wanted to pivot now back to talking about the kind of user community of the people who are actually using your products. One of the things, I think, that some of the big companies who read HBR have struggled with is creating communities around their products. I mean, this is something that people say– oh, we have to build a community around our products– but then when it comes time to do it, it seems there’s hesitation that I think sometimes seems to come from a desire just to control everything.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: Totally.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: So tell me about that. Is that something that you have wrestled with– how much control do we give away– or do you just have to trust people? Is it something that internet-native companies can do that established brands just can’t? I would love your thoughts on that.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: I feel like the equivalent of what companies sometimes do is they invite a bunch of people to their house for a party and they don’t put out any appetizers or drinks or anything. And they’re like, why aren’t people having fun? Why aren’t they having fun? Go have fun.\n\nYou know, you’ve got to grease the wheels a little bit. If you were hosting a dinner or a party, you would put out the snacks and the hors d’oeuvres. And you would make sure the liquor’s flowing freely and the wine and everything. You’re giving something to people, and then they start to participate. And whatever it is, the constructive is of what you’re trying to create.\n\nWith WordPress, I mean, we give away extremely good software. It’s multimillion dollar software that you can download for free. And so just from the start of it, people feel like they’ve gotten a lot of value.\n\nAnd for us, in particular– they get so much, again, for free, no expectations of anything– is a lot of people turn around and say, well, what can I do in return? What can I give back? Just like after a good dinner party, you might have a few of your guests helping out with the dishes. Because they’re so appreciative of how good the food is, what a great host you were. So as with all things, it works best when there’s no expectations.\n\nIf on your dinner party invite you said, you may come to dinner, but you have to stay for 34 minutes afterwards and clean up, that doesn’t sound like a very fun party, does it?\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: No. And it’s an interesting analogy because I think it’s– the other attitude I would say to continue that metaphor would be there’s a feeling of maybe some people are worried that they’ll have this party and then if people have too good of a time, the partygoers will get drunk and trash their house. And so it’s like, OK, everyone, time to go home because, really, you’ve had enough.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: Well, again, it’s the example you set. The parties I’ve been to that got a little out of hand, it was usually because the person who was hosting the party was also getting out of hand.\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Fair enough. One other thing you’ve just sort of hinted at there that I wanted to ask you about was the freemium model, because that’s obviously a model that relies on getting a significant number of people to use the product and then a smaller percentage to actually pay for it. This is something that I think a lot of different companies, legacy companies have looked at as maybe a way to make money in the internet era.\n\nDo you think that something like that would work for more companies? Do you think it’s just something that works for your company? It’s sort of a vague question, but I would love your thoughts on that as well.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: It just depends on the product. WordPress is relatively inexpensive to run for people. And so it doesn’t cost us a ton to have people use it for free. And so it’s a smart business decision– essentially use free as a mechanism to get more people in the door and then a percentage of them convert. And the economics of that work out.\n\nWe have another product called VaultPress. So VaultPress is a real-time backup system. So for the sites that you really care about, you can pay VaultPress $5 or $15 a month. And the instant that you make a change on your site, it’s backed up to nine different places. So it’s literally ultra ultra good backup.\n\nThis is a premium-only product. There’s no free version. And that’s because, well, it’s really expensive to run, because we’re storing nine or 11 copies of all your changes in real-time as soon as you make them. So that’s an example.\n\nI think it just depends on the economics of the product as well. Apple doesn’t give away free phones, but they work with phone companies to make the economics more affordable for people in the US. So they could subsidize phones. So you just have to look at your particular business model. The internet does make premium very, very attractive.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Yeah. I mean, and I guess the thing is the premium product then has to be worth the upgrade, because if it’s just marginally better, then no one would pay for it. for it. They’d just keep using the free product, I suppose.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: And that is the hardest part is deciding what to put in the free version and what to put behind the paid version, because the more stuff you put in the free, the more value it is, the more growth you have. But if you don’t have anything that’s super compelling behind the paywall, if you will, no one’s going to bother upgrading.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Well, and I guess so many internet companies now rely on advertising to support their business models. And I guess that’s the other question I have is, how much of this can we keep supporting off of ads?\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: You know, advertising is definitely going through a rough spot right now. A lot of the oxygen in the room is being eaten up by the Googles and Facebooks of the world. So I wouldn’t bet my business on advertising. I think if you can have a hybrid model where in good times advertising can support you and in other times you’re providing enough value to your core audience– that they’re paying you directly– I think that can be very sustainable.\n\nBut it is possible that when you think of advertising is fundamentally trying to get us to make an action, usually a commercial one. They’ll be able to close the loop on this a lot better. So advertising dollars will get smarter and smarter, where right now they just have a lot of work to do. They’re a little bit lazy. They’ll go to the big guys and folks who are holding people’s attention.\n\nLet’s say it’s a great 8,000-word HBR article that takes 30 minutes to read, and 10,000 people read it. You have 300,000 minutes of attention there. You should be able to monetize that from an advertising point of view just as well as a Google or Facebook. An ineffecient market.\n\nOne thing about the future as well is that you can imagine almost every device in your life becoming better when it’s connected to the internet. We’re seeing early versions of this with things like the Nest thermostat– you know, the ability to change the thermostat that’s upstairs when you’re downstairs or things like that, or turn it on when you leave or if you go on vacation.\n\nBut also things like– I actually just got– just like an hour ago– something called an Electric Objects frame. And basically what it is is it’s a screen, but it has no buttons, no controls, no notifications, no anything. All it does is a Mac screen that connects to the internet and displays art. And it looks beautiful– like a picture frame.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: That’s cool.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: And so now I have this device in my– that looks just like the art it’s sitting next to. And from my phone I can change what’s on there at any given point. And I think things like this will have entirely new mediums spring up around them, that we have a lot more control of our environment and our environments become a lot more complimentary to us, just like how your home can transform when you put a Sonos speaker in every room and you can synchronize them. That sort of tailoring of our environment [INAUDIBLE] mediated by the net. It’s going to be very exciting.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Well, and as someone who spends too much time staring at a screen, I sort of am excited about the idea of spending less time with screens. And I think connected objects are a way to get there.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: It’s ambient technology, right? So it’s a technology that fades into the background even though it’s always there.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Mm-hm. OK So in the past I have seen some interviews with you where you’ve talked about different personal productivity experiments you’ve run– changing your sleep schedule or limiting how often you check email. And I was wondering if you have any current ongoing personal productivity experiments that are currently underway– things you’re trying to do differently just to be happier or get more done.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: Yeah. Something I’m focused on right now is tiny habits. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. Things like, I do two sun salutations when I wake up in the morning, which is very easy, right? But by making sure I’m going to do two no matter how early or late I am or how rushed I am, I often end up doing a lot more. And these daily stretches are a great way to start the day. I do that with some exercises. I try to read a chapter of a book every day– very minimum.\n\nOne thing I’ve been more conscious of is productivity, we think of in terms of what you’re outputting. But I think it’s also really important to think of your state of mind that’s creating this. A lot of this, if you break it all down to the million different things you can do.\n\nBreathing– a lot of it comes back to breathing. And a good exercise that anyone listening to this or you yourself could do right now is just to stand there and take a few deep breaths, but take them from your belly instead of from your chest. So your chest should stay completely still. As you breathe in, expand your belly. And as you breathe out, feel it contract. And this just puts your body into a more relaxed state.\n\nAnd I find that if I can detect when I’m having a conversation or chatting or writing a blog post or something like that, I’m in more of the fight or flight mode. My brain’s probably more reactive and proactive. If you can just take a few deep breaths, it puts you into a great state to be able to really think through things and think through all sides of things and dispassionately examine both your feelings and what you’re outputting in a way that often has much superior results.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: That’s cool. As you were talking about that, I just tried to do it. And I do feel immediately more calm. So thank you for that.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: Instantly, right?\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Yeah.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: It’s the craziest thing because we all breathe all day. But you think about it for a few seconds, and it changes everything.\n\nSARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Yeah. Matt, thank you again so much for talking with us today. It’s really been a pleasure.\n\nMATT MULLENWEG: Likewise.\n\nHANNAH BATES: That was Automattic founder and CEO Matt Mullenweg in conversation with Sarah Green Carmichael on HBR IdeaCast.\n\nWe’ll be back next Wednesday with another hand-picked conversation about business strategy from the Harvard Business Review.

More notably, Roku is flying solo with its latest security cams rather than partnering up with a third party.\n\nWhile Roku had previously worked with Wyze Labs on its earlier smart home products, the upcoming Roku Battery Camera and Roku Battery Camera Plus are “all specifically Roku-designed cameras,” a Roku spokesperson told me during a New York City press event. (The company also unwrapped new Roku streaming players, which you can read about here.)\n\nAsked for the strategy behind breaking with Wyze, the Roku rep explained that the move allows for “more control over the app and the experience and prioritizing what we want to do, versus Wyze.”\n\nReached later by TechHive, another Roku spokesperson offered an additional statement: “We’re glad to have worked with Wyze to initially bring Roku Smart Home to the market. We’re proud of our new Roku-designed Battery Camera and Battery Camera Plus and excited to bring it to our Roku users.”\n\nWe’ve also asked Wyze for more details.\n\nPreviously known solely as a streaming media device manufacturer, Roku surprised many in the industry with its 2022 announcement that it was moving into the smart home space.\n\nThe Roku Battery Camera and Battery Camera Plus both have a bottom USB-C charging port. Ben Patterson/Foundry\n\nThe company did so with the help of Wyze, the maker of a popular line of budget security cameras as well as other smart home products. Roku ended up white-labeling a number of Wyze products, including smart light bulbs and light strips, smart plugs, video doorbells, and—naturally—security cameras.\n\nRoku later released the Roku Home Monitoring System SE, a rebrand of the Wyze Home Monitoring Core Starter Kit, and it also sells an indoor 360-degree camera, an outdoor camera, and a floodlight cam.\n\nThe new Roku Battery Camera and Battery Camera Plus look very different from the company’s Wyze-developed products. Both of the 1080p cams sport boxy, rectangular shells with rounded corners. They offer IP65-level protection from dust and resistance to low-pressure water jets from any angle. Rear threaded mounting holes let you attach the cameras to walls, eaves, or other structures.\n\nA rear threaded hole allows for mounting to a wall, eave, or other structure. Ben Patterson/Foundry\n\nThe main difference between the two new Roku cams appears to be their battery life, with the Roku Battery Camera ($49) delivering up to six months of battery-powered operation, versus up to two years for the Battery Camera Plus ($59). An upcoming and optional solar panel (no pricing yet) should allow the cameras to run almost indefinitely without the need for manual charging via AC adapter.\n\nOther features on the new cameras include an integrated spotlight, two-way audio, and motion alerts. Person, package, vehicle, and pet detection features require a Roku home security plan, which starts at $3.99 a month for a single camera (a second cam costs an additional $3.99 per month), or $9.99/month for all your cameras.\n\nAs with previous Roku security cameras, the Roku Battery Camera and Battery Camera Plus boast tight integration with the Roku app as well as Roku streaming players, with the latter capable of showing live feeds in a carousel on your big-screen TV.\n\nExpect the Roku Battery Camera and Roku Battery Camera Plus to arrive this summer. We’ll have full reviews once we have a chance to test out some sample units, so stay tuned for that."}

You can also summarize all of your emails with tracking in a search folder. These virtual folders will then live on the left-side of your Outlook window near the bottom of the folder list under “Search Folders.”\n\nHere’s how to create a new Search Folder:\n\nIn Outlook, go to Folder > New Search Folder.\n\nA window with predefined options will appear. You’ll be able to select emails from specific people, emails with attachments, older messages, or larger messages.\n\nTo filter by sender, choose “Mail from specific people,” click Select, and enter the email addresses.\n\nClick on the OK button to create the Search Folder.\n\nIn Outlook, certain mails can be summarized in search folders. This gives you a quicker and better overview of these mails and saves you having to use the search function repeatedly. IDG\n\nWhen the Search Folder gets created, it will start collecting matching emails (but it won’t move them)–it just creates a view of those emails in one place for easier access. Keep in mind that if you delete a message from the Search Folder, it will also be deleted from its original location (and vice versa).\n\nBy using Search Folders, you’ll save time and you’ll have an easier time keeping track of important emails."}

Now, it looks like the company is preparing to expand its capabilities. A new plugin-making system and several examples are already letting the tool’s tendrils expand to other services.\n\nWhile standard developers can already use the G-Assist API, Nvidia is hoping that more regular users will get in on the action, and has made a Plugin Builder to achieve this. Using ChatGPT’s generative code capabilities, it allows even a complete novice to “vibe code” and connect it with anything that also has an open API or a similar setup.\n\nThe video above shows an example user asking the Plugin Builder tool to generate a plugin to see if a Twitch streamer is live, then walks through the steps to create and install the plugin. It’s shockingly smooth, going from a text prompt to a functioning bit of code in two minutes (though I think it’s assuming a lot of how-to knowledge on the user’s part).\n\nNvidia has already built what it calls “official” G-Assist plugins to hook the system into Twitch, Spotify, Google Gemini, and peripheral and lighting control for Logitech, Corsair, and Nanoleaf, all available on GitHub. Nvidia says it’s going to create more plugins in the future, too.\n\nNvidia G-Assist is available in the official Nvidia app now, and naturally it needs an RTX 30-series GPU or later to work."}

While it’s not an entirely new idea, the Lorex 2K Wi-Fi Lightbulb Camera draws power from a standard E26/E27 light socket and can operate indoors and out.\n\nThe camera records in 2K resolution (2560 x 1440 pixels) at 15 frames per second with high dynamic range. When the camera is stationary, its lens has a diagonal field of view of 107.9 degrees (92.2 degrees horizontal, 50 degrees vertical), but an onboard motor allows it to pan 360 degrees (its degree of tilt is not specified). Video can be stored locally on a microSD card (not included, capacities up to 256GB are supported) or to one of Lorex’s network-attached Fusion Recorders. Lorex also offers an optional cloud subscription service. The camera is limited to operating on 2.4GHz Wi-Fi networks.\n\nThe Lorex 2K Wi-Fi Lightbulb Camera supports motion detection with person and vehicle detection, and it’s outfitted with a microphone and speaker for two-way talk. It also has an onboard siren. Its camera housing carries an IP65 weatherization rating, but the lighting element must be protected from the elements if installed outdoors. According to our IP code decoder, IP65 means the camera portion is impervious to dust and that it can withstand a blast of projected water from any direction (although it probably wouldn’t stand up to a pressure washer at close range).\n\nThe wrap-around, dimmable LED light on the Lorex s 2K Wi Fi Lightbulb Camera delivers 400 lumens of brightness at a color temperature of 6500K.

The light encircling the camera has a fixed color temperature of a cool 6500 Kelvin, and it is dimmable. It would probably be sufficient outdoors to illuminate a door lock beneath it; it would be considered mood lighting indoors. In either case, it should be sufficiently bright to enable the camera’s color night vision (black-and-white night vision is also supported).\n\nThis news story is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best home security cameras.\n\nThe Lorex 2K Wi-Fi Lightbulb Camera has a retail price of $99.99, but an introductory sale reduces that to $74.99 for a limited time. We’ll have an in-depth review of the product as soon as we can."}

Turns out, that’s no accident because Google is paying Samsung loads of money to make sure Gemini is front and center on its phones.\n\nThe information comes from a predictable source: testimony in the ongoing and potentially disastrous Google antitrust case. (No, not that one, the other one. Google has lost two separate antitrust cases brought by the US federal government in the last year.) Bloomberg reports that Google is paying Samsung “an enormous sum of money” to put Gemini on its phones and integrate it into the One UI Android skin, according to Google platform and device partnership VP Peter Fitzgerald.\n\nThe executive testified that the terms of the deal mean Google pays Samsung for every device that’s preloaded with Gemini and heavily featuring it in the system. Samsung also gets a cut of the advertising revenue generated from Gemini searches and other actions. The contract was set in place for at least two years, though the precise parameters (and how much an “enormous sum” amounts to) aren’t known.\n\nIt makes sense for Samsung. The company has been pushing its latest Galaxy devices as chock-full of AI capabilities (with a skeptical-at-best response from the technology press), and of course it’s pretty rare for a giant company to turn down dump trucks full of money. And this is a familiar move from Google, who’s known to pay Apple billions every year to keep its search on the iPhone and other devices. Less straightforward transactions—like insisting that phone makers load up their devices with Google services like Docs, Maps, and YouTube in order to keep access to the de facto standard Google Play Store app platform—have gotten the company in regulatory trouble before.\n\nUsers aren’t exactly thrilled with Gemini. As it fills up Google Search with answers of questionable utility and replaces long-term Google integrations like Google Assistant for smart device management, plenty of people are looking for alternatives. Apropos of nothing, did I tell you I really like the Vivaldi browser?\n\nIt remains to be seen what’ll happen as a result of the antitrust verdicts. The US Department of Justice wants to force Google to divest itself of the Chrome browser, and the same might happen to Google’s advertising business. Either (or both) would be a crushing blow to the tech giant, possibly knocking it out of its leading category. But it’s far from certain whether these results will come about, and Google will exhaust appeals and every other option to keep them from happening."}

The graphical conversion comes courtesy of the game development engine Unreal Engine 5, with a little input from Bethesda’s in-house gaming engine to keep it looking as true to the original version as possible.\n\nThanks to Unreal Engine 5, players will now be able to play Oblivion in 4K at up to 60 FPS, enjoying a level of detail they could otherwise only dream of in the original. They can forget about wandering past trees and shrubs that seemingly appear in 2D, for example, because they’ll now be rendered in mind-blowing 3D, like everything else in the game.\n\nIn addition to a graphics overhaul, the remaster boasts an updated UI as well as updated sound and visual effects. New enemy combat animations have been added too, which are sure to infuse an added level of adrenalin into fast-paced arena combat matches.\n\nAs the next installment in the Elder Scrolls franchise after Morrowind, it placed gamers in the most detailed and groundbreaking fantasy world of its time, full of interesting environments and interactive objects they could carry, move, and use. It was also teeming with reactive NPCs that would change their behavior according to what players did–look out, thieves, they’re going to catch you!\n\nBut as great as it was, over the years Oblivion’s graphics became outdated compared to newer games. Most Oblivion fans moved on to greener pastures–or at least whiter ones–when the next installment of the Elder Scrolls, the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, was released in 2011. I know I did, but I always kept a flame alive for the possibility of an Oblivion remake.\n\nRight now, I’m itching to download a copy and return to Cyrodiil. I still have a few lingering questions, though, like if I’ll be able to play my existing Oblivion mods in the remaster, but there’s no word yet from Bethesda on that point. Here’s hoping they’ll be easily adaptable…\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is available now on Windows PC on Steam or via a Game Pass Ultimate subscription. It’s also available on Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5."}

Hall, Explores Our Fear and Fascination around Snakes", "fullContent": "In a new book called Slither, Stephen S. Hall takes a deep dive into the biology and history of one of the most reviled animals.\n\nRachel Feltman: For Scientific American’s Science Quickly, I’m Rachel Feltman.\n\nPeople are funny about snakes. I remember being taught the rhyme, “Red touches black, you’re okay, Jack; red touches yellow, you’re a dead fellow,” in elementary school—never mind the fact that we did not have coral snakes in New Jersey.\n\nMy guest today has spent a lot of time exploring our cultural aversion to—and fascination with—snakes. Stephen S. Hall is a science writer and the author of seven books. He’s also a teacher of science communication at New York University, Rockefeller University and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. His latest book, Slither: How Nature’s Most Maligned Creatures Illuminate Our World, is on sale now.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nThank you so much for coming in to chat. I’m really looking forward to it.\n\nStephen S. Hall: My pleasure to be here. Thank you.\n\nFeltman: First question: Why snakes?\n\nHall: There’s several answers to that question. One of them is that as a kid, like many kids, I caught snakes, brought them home, put them in terrariums in the garage until my mother screamed when they would get loose, and that sort of ended that experiment. I was always fascinated by them because they were so different from other animals—and also so beautiful. There was a real fascination and attraction there. But I wasn’t a herper; I didn’t go out and continue to collect snakes.\n\nWhat I did do is become a science writer, and probably in the 2000s and 2010s, when I was reading science journals like Science and Nature, I occasionally would run across these really interesting major research articles based on snakes, and I always sort of set them aside, thinking, “This is kind of interesting. I should gather a little pile on this.”\n\nThe third piece of this explanation is that my agent suggested at one point, “Why don’t you do a book about an animal?” which I had never done before. And my first reaction was, “I’d only do a book about an animal that most people don’t like,” because I thought it’d be a really interesting challenge to try to change people’s minds. And as most people know snakes are not very popular. People do not like them—they’re afraid of them; they loathe them; there’re all these surveys that children detest snakes and adults detest snakes—and I thought it would be an interesting challenge to try to change people’s minds about a really interesting creature.\n\nFeltman: Very cool. Given your research for the book, how have our feelings about snakes evolved over time?\n\nHall: One of the things that surprised me is: this deeply embedded loathing of snakes was not always the case. In fact, that was the later evolution from earlier cultures, and part of the fun of doing Slither was going back and seeing how ancient cultures perceive snakes, and they perceived them very differently.\n\nThey were respected. They were venerated in some cultures. In, in early ancient Greek culture the snake was associated with healing. In Mesoamerican cultures the snake was associated with a kind of messenger that would go back and forth between humans and nature but also humans and the afterworld—the world of the nonliving, as it were. There was a great respect for these creatures. This was also true in ancient Egypt. And then [laughs] with the Garden of Eden story the snake got demonized and was blamed for human fallibility, human sin, and I think that changed a lot of perceptions.\n\nOne of the goals that I was trying to accomplish here was to get people to rethink what snakes represent: Why did ancient people venerate them, and is there a way to reclaim that sense of respect for these otherwise disliked creatures?\n\nFeltman: Well, and what do you think it is about snakes that made them venerated, and what do you think it is about them that makes people feel so negatively towards them?\n\nHall: In terms of the negative part they are so different from so many other creatures: They don’t have legs. They’re secretive. You can’t see them. They’re [laughs] extremely good at hiding. In fact, you know, there—it’s sort of a Darwinian badge of honor that they make themselves hard to see, with their camouflage skin, and coloration, and so on. So they represent a kind of extreme version of the other. And people also associate threat and danger with them, certainly with venomous snakes.\n\nOne of the interesting things that came up in the research—it’s a really interesting theory called the snake-detection theory. This is advanced by a researcher at the University of California, Davis, named Lynne Isbell. Isbell argues that the necessity of spotting snakes in the wild as a self-preservation mechanism led to the creation of a much larger primate brain, which we humans have inherited as well. So she attributes human acuity in vision to spotting snakes in [an] evolutionary sense that was developed a long time ago.\n\nFeltman: Yeah, I’ve also seen that as an explanation for why cats are freaked out by cucumbers; I’ll have to fact-check that. But that’s not [laughs] anything I’ve—I’ve heard that theory brought up before in the context of cats running away from cucumbers [laughs], so.\n\nHall: There’s some ingrained perception.\n\nCharles Darwin read a report by a German scientist—this is in the middle of the 19th century—that he had taken snakes to the monkey house in a zoo in Germany, and the monkeys went crazy just seeing that there was a snake in it when he revealed it. So Darwin puts a stuffed snake in a bag and goes to the London Zoo, and then he takes off the top, and all the monkeys go crazy, and he’d never seen a reaction like that. Then he went back with a live snake, and the same thing happened, and it was this sort of instantaneous reaction to the appearance of a snake, so there’s definitely an alarm system ...\n\nFeltman: Mm.\n\nHall: We don’t need to say that it was fear, necessarily, although some people call it a “fear module,” but there’s an alarm system in spotting a snake that I think is connected to the alarm that many humans feel when they see a snake.\n\nFeltman: Sure, and speaking of Darwin’s kind of crude research, how has our scientific understanding of snakes changed over time?\n\nHall: Scientists are belatedly using snakes as a nontraditional model organism.\n\nFeltman: Mm.\n\nHall: You would think that there was not much you could learn from a snake, but they’ve actually discovered some remarkable qualities in snakes because they finally started paying attention to them with the advent of molecular biology. What used to be observed naturalistically—okay, a snake eats a large prey and digests it—and they would take x-rays of it, like, in the 1970s; that was how metabolism was explained. After genomics emerged and they did the genome of the snake after the Human Genome Project, they discovered that snakes, pythons, as a model organism activate a huge suite of genes from the moment that they have a meal. And they were particularly interesting organisms to study because—I facetiously kinda say they invented intermittent fasting [laughs]—but, but they could go for a year at a time without eating a single meal. And then they eat these enormous meals. So the equivalence was, like, a 150-pound human, for example, roughly, eating a 220-pound hamburger ...\n\nFeltman: Mm [laughs].\n\nHall: “In one gulp.” That’s kind of what the meal of a python was like. How does an animal handle the digestion and processing of that? It turns out they activate all these genes that regenerate tissues in the body—a bigger heart, a bigger intestine—just to handle the [laughs] massive processing of this meal. And then they carve away all the regenerated tissue that they’ve created and go back to normal. So they have this ability to regenerate tissue, which, of course, is something we can’t do, except in a couple of isolated cases, and it became a really interesting thing to study.\n\nAnother thing that’s really interesting is convergent evolution: this idea that animals can evolve the same traits, although they’re completely unrelated. So there was a study that came out a couple years ago on spitting cobras. The researchers established that three different lineages of cobras that were completely independent of each other each evolved the anatomical mechanism to spit venom—a physiological change. They evolved the behavior to aim the spit at the eyes of whatever it was that was threatening them.\n\nFeltman: Wow.\n\nHall: And they independently evolved a change in their venom that produced excruciating pain in eyes. So independently all three of those different qualities were evolved in three different species of snakes that were completely unrelated to each other, in a sense. You couldn’t have found that out until you had genomics and very sophisticated molecular analysis of venom and all that stuff.\n\nFeltman: Yeah. What were some of the most surprising things that you learned in this project as someone who already really had a fondness for snakes?\n\nHall: The thing that really impressed me is how adaptive snakes are, how rapidly they adjust to their environment; it’s one of their signal traits. They’re very diverse—it’s amazing that they can live on every continent except Antarctica, which means temperate, cold weather, tropical weather, jungle, seawater. If there’s a threat in the environment, they have these remarkably ingenious evolutionary adaptations to it. There’s a story of these sea snakes in, in the Pacific off New Caledonia that, in response to the pollution in the waters there, have developed melanistic characteristics—a darker coloration in their skin—because that sequesters all these toxic chemicals that are in the water and prevents it from harming the animal, and then they slough off their skin and they get rid of the chemicals. And it’s only in those snakes that are inhabiting that particular niche.\n\nThis idea of being able to adapt to environmental challenge really struck me, not just because of the cleverness of the evolution or the selective process, but also, it’s a warning to us in terms of climate change and changes in the global meteorological systems. Snakes have a way of adapting to this that we don’t have, and maybe we can learn something from them. It’s really interesting that in the Mesoamerican cultures in particular, snakes were traditionally associated with meteorological events ...\n\nFeltman: Mm.\n\nHall: So rain, lightning, thunderstorms, droughts, floods, and all of that being attached to agricultural fertility. And these are all issues that are front and center now because of climate change, and I think the ancients realized that snakes were symbols of coming to terms with both the unpredictability of nature and perhaps suggesting ways to adapt to it.\n\nI spoke to a very well-known Australian herpetologist named Rick Shine. He did fieldwork in [the mountains of] Tasmania, which has horrible weather, and there are snakes there, and, you know, he said there’s only 20 or 30 really nice sunny days there. And humans go there, and they think, “This is the most god-awful environment. How could anything live here?” And the snakes live under the rocks for all but those 20 or 30 days, and then they come out, and they think they’re living in the villa by the sea [laughs], and it’s just, it’s a sunny day for them; they don’t have the sense that it’s a bad environment because they adjust to it. And he had this wonderful observation—he just wondered what it felt like for a snake to emerge into the sunlight, warm up, have all its organ systems click on, its consciousness click on. He said, “That must be an amazing feeling.” And I thought that was a wonderful way of kind of capturing the uniqueness of these creatures.\n\nFeltman: Yeah, well, and speaking of that adaptation, what dangers are snakes facing these days?\n\nHall: I would say the biggest danger’s habitat destruction. And there are a couple of anecdotes in the book—so I talk about when I caught snakes as a kid, and this was in a sort of exurban area of Michigan, outside Detroit. I went back to that area 50 years later to see how the habitat had changed, and all the places where you would catch turtles or you catch snakes or you would see them, it’s all changed: It’s been developed residentially. Population spread has confined the habitat.\n\nThomas Cole, who’s a pretty famous Hudson River School painter, had made the point that a habitat destruction was something that needed to be addressed or, as he put it, we would lose Eden and wouldn’t be able to recover it again.\n\nFeltman: Why do you think people should care about snakes?\n\nHall: I think it’s really important, when we talk about conservation, preservation of species, prevention of extinction, that we don’t only think about cute animals that everybody likes. It’s really important to globally embrace all creatures—including, in this case, that animal that is so different and so repulsive and historically so loathed by so many people—because if we pick and choose, we’re really not saving anything in terms of habitat or anything else.\n\nAnd it’s an acknowledgement that ecologies are complicated, that there are these very fragile webs, and it’s not just birds or mammals or snakes, but it’s the combination and interaction of these creatures that creates a vibrant and sustainable ecology. It’s really important to include everyone in our conservation arc, if you will.\n\nFeltman: Absolutely. Steve, thank you so much for coming on to talk to us, and I’m sure our listeners are really gonna love your book.\n\nHall: Thank you very much for having me.\n\nFeltman: That’s all for today’s episode.

Who do you expect the Giants to be pursuing, or at least who should they be pursuing?\n\nThe Giants sit at 15-9 with a 47% chance at the playoffs. I agree they'll be looking to upgrade at the deadline.\n\nOffensively, left field and first base seem like potential areas to improve. Heliot Ramos, manning left field, hasn't hit much over his last 200 PA dating back to last year. The Giants have some options in Triple-A, but none that seem clearly better than the likely 2-WAR-ish Ramos. Looking through the various unlikely playoff teams' outfields, I could see Taylor Ward being a decent target. Still, I'm not convinced he's better than Ramos. We'll get to Luis Robert Jr. later in this mailbag.\n\nBryce Eldridge homered in his first at-bat of the year yesterday, and if he gets to Triple-A quickly and hits well, I could see a fast track to the Majors. The bottom line is that I don't see an obvious position player for the Giants to target - yet.\n\nAs I said last week, the Giants will need more starting pitching behind Logan Webb. Landen Roupp and Justin Verlander both pitched well against the Angels over the weekend. Robbie Ray is entrenched salary-wise. Jordan Hicks could wind up in the bullpen, though he would probably not prefer that.\n\nSandy Alcantara is the name on everyone's lips, and he's back throwing 98 and getting groundballs, though he hasn't actually pitched well through four starts. Sonny Gray could be interesting, though there's no suggestion he'd waive his no-trade clause. Which other pitchers might be available at the deadline?"}

In fact, I’ve switched from Windows to ChromeOS and I’m loving every minute of it.\n\nNow, I want to be fully transparent: I admit that I still own an all-in-one Windows PC (currently running Windows 10 because Microsoft doesn’t think it’s capable of Windows 11), and I’m also likely to buy a new Windows PC before support for Windows 10 officially ends.\n\nHowever, my Windows PC only exists as a backup for those increasingly rare times when my Chromebook isn’t right for the task. Most days, my Chromebook is more than sufficient. Here’s why I switched and why I now love Chromebooks more than Windows laptops.\n\nRelated: The best Chromebooks for every budget\n\nWhy I switched to a Chromebook\n\nWhy did I switch from Windows to ChromeOS? There were several factors that influenced my decision. Some may resonate with you, while others may differ from your own experiences.\n\nReason 1: A simpler, less frustrating operating system\n\nDave Parrack / IDG\n\nAfter decades of using Windows in its various forms, I grew tired of how frustrating it has become to use. It feels bloated and slow more often than not, even with a decently specced machine and everything updated.\n\nI don’t want to wait minutes for an operating system to fully boot and be ready to use, I don’t want it to constantly grind away in the background doing God knows what, and I don’t want to be troubleshooting it all the time when things inevitably go wrong.\n\nI want an operating system that boots on demand in seconds and simply works without fuss or obstacles. I just want to get on with my day and do what I need to do. That’s what I found in ChromeOS.\n\nReason 2: Less stress about malware and security issues\n\nWindows has always been the favorite target of scammers and hackers due to its mainstream popularity and the many vulnerabilities that continue to pop up even as older ones are fixed.\n\nIn other words, while Microsoft has admittedly improved in this area, malware is more likely to hit and infect a Windows machine than a Chromebook. (Windows is riskier to use than macOS and Linux, too.)\n\nChromeOS is especially safe and secure thanks to a range of built-in security features, including Verified Boot (which checks for unexpected changes on startup), Sandboxing at all levels (which ensures any issues are kept isolated), and the inability to run random executables.\n\nAll of this, combined with the fact that malware creators are less likely to target ChromeOS, means I can use my Chromebook without worrying as long as I’m mindful of best practices for digital security.\n\nDave Parrack / IDG\n\nAnother constant frustration of using Windows that made me look around for an alternative is the seemingly never-ending updates that Microsoft pushes onto users — updates that aren’t seamlessly applied in the background but disruptive to daily productivity.\n\nI’ve often heard my PC chugging away as it downloads a massive Windows update, which then prompts me to restart my computer in order to install it. That can sometimes take upwards of an hour.\n\nChromeOS, on the other hand, is such a lightweight operating system that its regular updates are fast, silent, and without fuss. It takes the hassle out of maintaining an operating system.\n\nReason 4: Productivity without spending a fortune\n\nDave Parrack / IDG\n\nAs a freelance writer and editor, I have the privilege to work anywhere — at home, at an office, at a coffee shop, or even while on vacation. But only if I have a machine that’s light, portable, and user-friendly enough.\n\nSure, there are plenty of Windows laptops and MacBooks out there that fit the profile, but they generally come with higher price tags than Chromebooks. For me, a Chromebook strikes the right balance between usability, performance, and affordability.\n\nReason 5: I’m already embedded in Google’s ecosystem\n\nDave Parrack / IDG\n\nThe final reason why I made the switch away from Windows to ChromeOS is the fact that I’m already embedded in Google’s ecosystem.\n\nI own an Android phone and I use most of Google’s apps (including Gmail, Meet, Calendar, Maps, Photos, etc.), so it wasn’t a huge leap to ditch Windows and go (almost) all-in on ChromeOS.\n\nIn fact, the switch has made things easier for me as I now have full access to all of my data across my phone, Chromebook, and other devices.\n\nWhy I don’t regret making the switch\n\nI have no regrets about buying a Chromebook and I have no shame in preferring ChromeOS over Windows. Here are three big ways in which the switch has left me in a better place than before.\n\nI’m actually more productive\n\nMatthew Smith / IDG\n\nThe most obvious benefit I’ve felt after switching is a boost to my productivity, and that in turn has improved my work-life balance.\n\nAs a writer who works from home but also needs the option to work outside of the home at times, a Chromebook offers the perfect blend of power and portability. I can get my work done with little fuss and I can do it from anywhere, without the operating system bogging me down.\n\nChromeOS boots instantly and is ready when I need it\n\nDave Parrack / IDG\n\nDespite being a desk worker, I don’t actually have to be sat at a desk for 8 straight hours every day. I have flexibility in my schedule, and that’s why I need a machine that’s always ready to use on demand.\n\nSure, I could leave my Windows laptop running all day and jump on/off as required, but I don’t like the idea of needless idling. Sleep and hibernation modes are also options, but Windows is too sluggish for me when it comes to waking up.\n\nChromeOS offers a more practical and environmentally friendly alternative. Given how lightweight Google’s OS is, it’s no surprise that it boots instantly and can be used at a moment’s notice.\n\nWeb and Android apps are enough for me\n\nDave Parrack / IDG\n\nOne of the bigger worries I had when leaving Windows was losing access to all the Windows programs I’d been using for years. However, those fears proved (mostly) unfounded as there are adequate Android apps and web apps to replace the ones I used on Windows.\n\nWhat you may not know is that Chromebooks aren’t just limited to websites and Chrome extensions. A few years ago, Google added the ability to natively run Android apps on Chromebooks, and most apps in the Google Play Store are compatible with ChromeOS.\n\nSome work better than others, of course, and there was a lot of trial and error as I sought apps that most closely matched my needs and preferences. But these days, web and Android apps are pretty darn good and you can easily get by except in very specific situations.\n\nWhat you might miss if you switch from Windows to Chromebook\n\nChromeOS works perfectly for me 99 percent of the time, but if you decide to follow suit and switch from Windows to Google’s operating system, there are some things you may miss — and I’d be remiss if I didn’t at least mention them.\n\nAccess to your full-featured desktop applications\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWhile I was able to find suitable web and Android apps to replace most of the Windows programs I previously relied on, some niche programs simply don’t have viable web or Android alternatives.\n\nFor example, if your job requires that you use a particular Windows-only app — maybe even an in-house app that’s specific to your company — then you may not have a choice.\n\nAnother example is software that comes in web and Windows versions, with the Windows version being more full-featured or more performant. In that case, switching to the web version might be an obvious downgrade that seriously harms productivity or usability.\n\nTherefore, you really have to do your research before making the switch, whether you’re switching to ChromeOS or some other operating system like macOS or Linux. Windows-only apps are a valid deal-breaker.\n\nPC games without needing to rely on cloud gaming\n\nDave Parrack / IDG\n\nContrary to popular belief, you can game on a Chromebook — and the experience is far better than you’d probably expect it to be. The caveat is that you can’t just install Steam and play all the same PC games that you can enjoy on a Windows machine.\n\nYes, you can install Steam on Chromebooks now, but not all games on Steam are compatible with ChromeOS. You can also install most Android games on ChromeOS, which opens up a whole world of casual gaming opportunities (along with mobile ports of popular games like Stardew Valley, Dead Cells, and Hollow Knight).\n\nOtherwise, you have to rely on cloud gaming services if you want to play mainstream AAA games on a Chromebook. Using platforms like Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia’s GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna, you can stream gameplay to your Chromebook… but it’s notably not the same as playing games locally on a high-end machine.\n\nIf these limited gaming options are a problem for you, then you should probably skip the Chromebook. (Or keep a separate gaming PC.)\n\nSystem upgradeability and customizations\n\nFramework\n\nIf you’re a fan of either customizing your system to your heart’s content or upgrading your hardware to stay ahead of the curve, then ChromeOS probably won’t be for you.\n\nIt’s meant to be a lightweight operating system that works out of the box, not something for tinkering and customizing and messing around in. And while that suits me perfectly, it won’t suit everyone. The same goes for the hardware, as you’re pretty much stuck with what you buy.\n\nThankfully, ChromeOS isn’t at all heavy on resources, so as long as you buy smart to begin with, the hardware should last."}

These findings shed new light on the mysterious superconductivity and strange metallicity that emerge when graphene sheets are rotated to the magic angle.\n\nThe fundamental properties of materials depend critically on their underlying particles—the flow of electrons governs electrical resistance, and atomic lattice vibrations, termed phonons, drive heat conductivity. However, when electrons and phonons are coupled, remarkable new phenomena can emerge.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing phenomenon occurs when the coupling enables phonons to effectively bind electrons into pairs, resulting in superconductivity—a state where electrical current flows without resistance. Despite its crucial role, measurements of electron-phonon coupling for individual phonon modes have remained an outstanding challenge.\n\nTwo years ago, a team of researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science, led by Prof. Shahal Ilani, developed the Quantum Twisting Microscope. This microscope uses an atomically-thin van der Waals material at its tips as a quantum interferometer, enabling direct measurement of the electronic wave functions within a quantum material. With their original QTM, operating at room temperature, they were able to image the electronic spectrum of various materials.\n\nNow, creating a QTM that works at cryogenic temperatures, the team discovered that it can also image phonons with unprecedented precision. The new QTM employs an inelastic process, where electrons tunneling between two atomically-thin layers emit a phonon whose energy and momentum are controlled by adjusting the voltage bias and twist angle between the layers. By systematically tuning these parameters, they could map the complete phonon energy spectrum of the material under investigation.\n\n\"Our technique not only measures the phonon spectrum but also quantifies how strongly electrons couple to each phonon mode,\" says Dr. John Birkbeck, a lead author of this study. \"Materials host numerous phonon modes, each can have a wide range of momenta. Our microscope quantitatively reveals how electrons interact with each mode individually, providing unprecedented insight into electron–phonon dynamics.\"\n\nApplying this novel technique to twisted bilayer graphene yielded a surprising discovery: a unique low-energy vibration known as a phason, whose coupling to electrons grows stronger as the graphene layers approach the magic angle. This behavior had never been observed before and suggests that phasons may play a key role in the strange metal behavior and superconductivity observed in this system.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Its unique ability to probe both electronic states and collective excitations paves the way for discoveries relevant to quantum computing, sensing technologies, and future quantum electronic devices.\n\nMore information: Shahal Ilani, Quantum twisting microscopy of phonons in twisted bilayer graphene, Nature (2025).

Credit: Raymar, MAEF\n\nThe Phoenician culture emerged in the Bronze Age city-states of the Levant, developing prominent innovations such as the first alphabet (from which many present-day writing systems derive). By the early first millennium BCE, Phoenician cities had established a vast maritime network of trading posts as far as Iberia, spreading their culture, religion, and language throughout the central and western Mediterranean.\n\nBy the sixth century BCE, Carthage, a Phoenician coastal colony in what is now Tunisia, had risen to dominate this region. These culturally Phoenician communities associated with or ruled by Carthage became known as \"Punic\" by the Romans. The Carthaginian empire left its mark in history, particularly well-known for the three large-scale \"Punic Wars\" with the rising Roman Republic, including the Carthaginian general Hannibal's surprise campaign to cross the Alps.\n\nWithin the framework of the Max Planck-Harvard Research Center for the Archaeoscience of the Ancient Mediterranean, co-directed by Johannes Krause, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and Michael McCormick of Harvard University, an international team of researchers has now presented a study on the genetic history of these ancient Mediterranean civilizations.\n\nThe work is published in the journal Nature.\n\nMap of sites included in the aDNA study (approximately 600 BCE). The numbers indicate the number of human genomes produced from these sites. Credit: Harald Ringbauer\n\nNew perspective on the spread of Phoenician culture\n\nThe new study aimed to use ancient DNA to characterize Punic people's ancestry and look for genetic links between them and Levantine Phoenicians, with whom they share a common culture and language. This was made possible by sequencing and analyzing a large sample of genomes from human remains buried in 14 Phoenician and Punic archaeological sites spanning the Levant, North Africa, Iberia, and the Mediterranean islands of Sicily, Sardinia, and Ibiza.\n\nThe researchers revealed an unexpected result. \"We find surprisingly little direct genetic contribution from Levantine Phoenicians to western and central Mediterranean Punic populations,\" says lead author Harald Ringbauer, who was a post-doctoral scientist at Harvard University when he began this research, and is now a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.\n\n\"This provides a new perspective on how Phoenician culture spread—not through large-scale mass migration, but through a dynamic process of cultural transmission and assimilation.\"\n\nThe study highlights that Punic sites were home to people with vastly different ancestry profiles. \"We observe a genetic profile in the Punic world that was extraordinarily heterogeneous,\" says David Reich, a professor of Genetics and Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University who co-led the work.\n\n\"At each site, people were highly variable in their ancestry, with the largest genetic source being people similar to contemporary people of Sicily and the Aegean, and many people with significant North African-associated ancestry as well.\"\n\nPainted Ostrich egg from the Punic necropolis in Villarricos (Spain).

Credit: Museo Arqueológico Nacional Madrid\n\nAncient DNA reveals cosmopolitan nature of Punic world\n\nThe results underscore the Punic world's cosmopolitan nature. Individuals with North African ancestry lived next to and intermingled with a majority of people of mainly Sicilian-Aegean ancestry in all sampled Punic sites, including Carthage. Moreover, genetic networks across the Mediterranean suggest that shared demographic processes—such as trade, intermarriage, and population mixing—played a critical role in shaping these communities.\n\nThe researchers even found a pair of close relatives (ca. second cousins) bridging the Mediterranean, one buried in a North African Punic site and one in Sicily.\n\n\"These findings reinforce the idea that ancient Mediterranean societies were deeply interconnected, with people moving and mixing across often large geographic distances,\" says Ilan Gronau, a professor of Computer Science at Reichman University in Herzliya, Israel, who co-led the work.\n\nHe adds, \"Such studies highlight the power of ancient DNA in its ability to shed light on the ancestry and mobility of historical populations for which we have relatively sparse direct historical records.\"\n\nMore information: David Reich, Punic people were genetically diverse with almost no Levantine ancestors, Nature (2025).

You could say it’s changing the toolsets VPNs have to protect their users’ privacy and combat cyber threats online. But are AI-enhanced VPNs any better than traditional VPNs?\n\nFurther reading: The best VPN services\n\nHow AI-enhanced VPNs differ from traditional VPNs\n\nThe quick answer to the above question is: Yes, they are better – because of the benefits that AI-driven VPNs bestow.\n\nThe main difference between AI-enhanced VPNs and traditional VPNs is that the former incorporate AI-driven bots to manage the VPN connections and other processes, whereas traditional VPNs rely mostly on old-fashioned algorithms.\n\nThese AI-driven bots are like smart assistants that continuously analyze network conditions and threats on the fly, thereby tightening the screws on network traffic and security and also analyzing your preferences for the most personalized experience possible.\n\nThe biggest benefit is speed; AI-enhanced VPNs provide faster connectivity than traditional VPNs since they’re able to overcome the slow connectivity that traffic-monitoring and encryption by VPNs can cause.\n\nOne way they do that is by dynamically monitoring server loads and then shifting connections to less congested servers. But they can also do things like optimize your connection based on your preferences or your browser search history, making your browsing far quicker and more tailored to your browsing needs.\n\nSay you’re gaming or streaming and need the quickest connection possible, your AI-driven VPN may pause all updates or background processes so that you get the smoothest data transfer speeds possible – that’s just one example of how it can work.\n\nEnhanced encryption is another big benefit of AI-enhanced VPNs. AI bots in these VPNs can quickly and efficiently pinpoint vulnerabilities in existing cryptographic profiles and adopt newer profiles without needing any human intervention, while traditional VPNs need operator input.\n\nThat means they can adapt quicker to new threats from hackers and malware, thereby enhancing threat detection for their users. They can more easily suggest user-specific responses to threats too.\n\nNordVPN is just one VPN using AI tools. Pexels: Stefan Coders\n\nWhich VPNs are using AI?\n\nMost well-known VPNs have already integrated some kind of AI technology into their software and servers – but some use it more than others.\n\nExpressVPN, for example, uses an AI-powered system that adjusts its encryption methods based on the type of data being transmitted by users.\n\nThis is especially useful for remote workers, since it provides them with an extra layer of security against hackers. ExpressVPN also uses AI to suggest the quickest server locations.\n\nAnother popular VPN, Avast SecureLine VPN, uses AI to enhance its threat-detection capabilities – which enables it to more easily identify and block unauthorized login attempts to user accounts.\n\nThen there are VPNs that excel at using AI to prevent phishing scams. One of these, Symlex VPN, claims to be the first VPN to use AI to prevent location-based phishing attempts that rely on a users’ geographical location.\n\nNordVPN, too, uses an AI-enabled browser extension it calls Sonar to spot potential phishing scams, which are increasingly becoming harder for users to identify.\n\nmentioned in this article NordVPN Read our review Price When Reviewed: desde 3,99 € al mes Best Prices Today:\n\nAre there any limitations to AI-enhanced VPNs?\n\nLike other forms of AI, the AI technologies incorporated into VPNs do have their limitations.\n\nOne problem VPN operators currently have to deal with is when their AI bots make false positive identifications of threats, making it more difficult for users to access legitimate data or communications.\n\nAnother concern is the fact that AI algorithms require access to considerable amounts of user data to be trained, which could jeopardize user privacy. Although, you could argue that since VPNs are in the business of safeguarding user privacy, some level of trust is required on the part of the user.\n\nThese are challenges that need to be further addressed, and I’m sure they will be as companies continue to develop and finesse their use of AI technologies in VPNs into the future.\n\nFurther reading: 5 VPN features you need to start using today"}

It’s not quite an Enron- or FTX-style “abandon ship” situation, but between two separate US antitrust rulings on its core search and advertising businesses, it’s a five-alarm fire. One of the possible outcomes is Google selling off the Chrome browser… and it looks like one possible buyer is OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI’s head of product for ChatGPT is named Nick Turley, and he testified at the remedy phase of the Department of Justice’s successful monopoly suit against Google. When asked if OpenAI would be interested in buying the Chrome browser from Google, Turley didn’t mince words. “Yes, we would,” he responded, “as would many other parties.” That’s according to The Information.\n\nThe fact that plenty of other companies would be interested in relieving Google of the burden of Chrome isn’t surprising. It’s the most popular browser on the planet, and its open-source Chromium codebase powers most other browsers (including Microsoft’s Edge, Opera, plus smaller players like Brave, Vivaldi, and Arc). The only major players left on the market that don’t use Chromium are Firefox and Apple’s Safari.\n\nDivested of its deep ties to Google for search, advertising, and mobile integration on Android, Chrome would be less of a crowning jewel of web properties. But it would still be enormously beneficial, a potentially huge profit-maker all on its own. And more pertinently, it would be even more useful in a broader technology toolbox for a tech giant like Microsoft. They’ve been pretty desperate to gain back ground in the browser wars ever since Internet Explorer lost its dominance.\n\nBut let’s examine this from the perspective of OpenAI. Despite being in its infancy, the popularity of ChatGPT and the broader rise of “AI” tools has propelled OpenAI to the forefront of the tech industry. OpenAI’s GPT underlies Microsoft’s Copilot system, and it’s integrated into more and more products and services every day (for better or worse). Meanwhile, CEO Sam Altman is rubbing shoulders with elites from industry and government. Even so, some critics have questioned OpenAI’s ability to continue on its current trajectory without some kind of giant technological leap. Despite a massive increase in profile and billions in revenue, the company has yet to turn a profit, and does not expect to for years at least.\n\nSuddenly, having the keys to the world’s most popular browser would change a lot of variables in that equation. It would, almost certainly, put ChatGPT and other generative AI tools front and center in the way most users experience the web. It would make OpenAI a direct competitor to companies like Apple and its current partner Microsoft. It would put it on the map for the same kind of advertising and user data tracking that got Google in trouble in the first place. And perhaps most importantly, it would give OpenAI a treasure trove of data from billions of users around the world, all the better to train its models.\n\nMost of this is educated guessing, albeit fairly obvious conclusions to draw. The DOJ wants Google to be forced to split off Chrome in some capacity, but we’ll have to see if the federal judge actually goes for that as a punitive option. And assuming that happens, Google will exhaust every legal possibility (and probably spend a small country’s GDP on lawyers in the process) to hold onto one of its most important business assets. If all that comes to pass and Chrome is still put up on the auction block, the buyer might be subject to yet more approval in the US and beyond.\n\nThe situation is, in a word, complicated. And there’s not much we can do in the meantime but wait and see how it plays out."}

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nDrought-fueled wildfires in Southern California, a devastating hurricane in the southern Appalachian Mountains, and catastrophic floods in New England are among the most recent disasters to bring the increasingly astronomical costs of climate change into focus.\n\nAs a growing number of local and national governments struggle to recover from—and protect against—more frequent and destructive climate disasters, some have directly sought compensation from fossil fuel companies through civil cases and \"polluters pay\" laws. But many of these actions are being challenged or slowed in court, partly due to the difficulty in showing that specific climate impacts occurred because of any one company's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nA study published in the journal Nature, however, provides a tool for potentially recouping the costs of extreme weather amplified by climate change. The researchers lay out a scientific framework they report can be used to trace specific climate damages back to emissions from individual fossil fuel companies.\n\nThe framework combines climate modeling with publicly available emissions data to contrast the current climate and its impacts to what it would be like without the heat-trapping gases a company's activities released into the atmosphere. This causal link is known as a \"but for\" standard—as in, a climate catastrophe likely would not have occurred but for an individual firm's actions, the researchers report.\n\n\"We argue that the scientific case for climate liability is closed, even if the future of these cases remains an open question,\" says Justin Mankin, the study's senior author and associate professor of geography at Dartmouth. The study, he says, answers a question first posed in 2003 about whether science could ever link an individual firm's emissions to climate change.\n\n\"Just over 20 years later, we find the answer to be 'yes,'\" says Mankin, who directs the Climate Modeling and Impacts Group at Dartmouth. \"Our framework can provide robust emissions-based attributions of climate damages at the corporate scale. This should help courts better evaluate liability claims for the losses and disruptions resulting from human-caused climate change.\"\n\nMankin and the study's first author, Christopher Callahan, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford who began working on the project as a Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth, deploy the framework to provide the first causal estimates of regional economic losses due to extreme heat resulting from the emissions of individual fossil fuel companies.\n\nExtreme heat linked to carbon dioxide and methane from just 111 companies cost the world economy $28 trillion from 1991 to 2020, with $9 trillion of those losses attributable to the five top-emitting firms, according to the study. The highest-emitting investor-owned firm they examined may be responsible for $791 billion to $3.6 trillion in heat-related losses over that period, the researchers report.\n\n\"Our findings demonstrate that it is in fact possible to compare the world as it is to a world absent individual emitters,\" Callahan says.\n\n\"The affluence of the Western economy has been based on fossil fuels,\" he says, \"but just as a pharmaceutical company would not be absolved from the negative effects of a drug by the benefits of that drug, fossil fuel companies should not be excused for the damage they've caused by the prosperity their products have generated.\"\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter—daily or weekly.\n\nThe study, Callahan and Mankin say, benefits from 20 years of accumulating real-world climate impacts, the increased availability of climate and socioeconomic data, and methodological advances in \"climate attribution science,\" a form of modeling that allows scientists to track the effects of climate change almost in real time.\n\nClimate attribution is the crux of Vermont's 2024 Climate Superfund Act, which was partially informed by Mankin's testimony and an early version of the Nature study. Passed in the wake of devastating statewide floods in 2023, the law empowers the state attorney general to compel major fossil fuel companies to help cover the cost of disasters that can be scientifically linked to their emissions.\n\nA recent lawsuit challenges the state's authority to collect such damages, as well as Vermont's ability to accurately use climate attribution science to determine them.\n\nThe attribution framework reported in Nature incorporates established, peer-reviewed scientific methods for identifying the effect of specific emission levels on extreme weather. Callahan and Mankin also build on advances in the physical and social sciences that have drawn clearer connects between greenhouse gases, local climate change, and economic losses.\n\nCritically, the model goes a step further than existing research by removing total emissions—measured in billions of tons—from the equation to identify a company's specific greenhouse gas footprint. Previous attribution models have hinged on concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which are measured in parts-per-million that are harder to attribute to specific sources, Callahan says.\n\n\"Our approach simulates emissions directly, allowing us to trace warming and its repercussions back to specific emitters,\" Callahan says. His and Mankin's focus on extreme heat builds on their previous work calculating global financial losses due to heat waves and the economic damages individual countries have caused to others by contributing to climate warming.\n\n\"Extreme heat is indelibly linked to climate change itself and the losses from it have been an instigator for legal claims. So, it's an obvious place to illustrate the broad application of our approach,\" Mankin says.\n\n\"We also live in a world that has warmed considerably over the past 20 years,\" he says. \"This analysis is not a predictive exercise where we ask what the future holds. Instead, it's a documentary effort where we show what has already happened and provide the reason why.\"\n\nMore information: Christopher Callahan, Carbon majors and the scientific case for climate liability, Nature (2025).

It turns out other workloads/applications also were negatively impacted by this regression. While a stumper at first even with the bisected commit, the issue was luckily resolved very quickly.\n\nIn less than 24 hours from shining attention on this new performance regression introduced in the Linux 6.15 kernel, Linus Torvalds has now pulled in the patch to address the unexpected and quite severe performance regression.\n\nThe kernel mailing list discussion began rather unexpectedly with the author of the bisected commit causing the regression commenting: \"3x regression? wow. Thanks for heads up. I'm staring at the patch and don't see it. Adding more experts.\"\n\nUpstream kernel developers at first had trouble reproducing the performance regression but fortunately, overnight SUSE Linux engineer Vlastimil Babka had widdled down the path of the issue thanks to his work on the kernel's slab code. With a newer GCC compiler also provided an important clue and ultimately a patch was figured out. Testing it confirmed the Nginx regression reported was resolved.\n\nLinux developer Alexei Starovoitov also discovered the troubled commit caused a 3x performance regression for Netperf and asked Linus Torvalds to pull the fix directly given the severity of the regression.\n\nLinus Torvalds has merged the patch by Vlastimil Babka that takes care of the performance regression.\n\nI've tested the patch multiple times and indeed confirming the huge hit to the performance on Linux 6.15 Git is resolved by today's patch.

It’s been a revelation", "fullContent": "It only took about ten years, but I’ve finally made Windows Task View part of my everyday workflow.\n\nTask View arrived with Windows 10 in 2015, providing an alternative to cramming all of your open windows into the space afforded by your screen. By clicking the Task View button on the Windows taskbar — or just pressing Windows key + Tab — you can see all your open windows and arrange them into separate workspaces, known as virtual desktops.\n\nIt’s the kind of feature I should theoretically love, but my earlier attempts to use it always ended in failure. Too often I’d forget about those extra virtual desktops I had set up and would gravitate back toward opening all my windows in one place.\n\nBy rethinking my approach to Task View — and by taking advantage of some new Windows features — I’ve finally made a habit of using it in a way that saves time and helps me focus.\n\nThis column first appeared in Advisorator, Jared’s weekly tech advice newsletter. Sign up to get tech advice like this every Tuesday.\n\nTask View for layouts, not tasks\n\nTask View is right next to the Start button. Jared Newman / Foundry\n\nMy light bulb moment with Task View was actually inspired by the Stage Manager feature in macOS. Stage Manager displays your most recently viewed windows on the left side of the screen. If you drag multiple windows onto the desktop, Stage Manager remembers that layout when you switch to another app, so you can bring it back with one click.\n\nStage Manager comes in handy when I’m trying to focus on writing. I’ll put my writing/notetaking app (Obsidian) on one side of the screen and my web browser (Vivaldi) on the other, so I can research and write without being distracted by anything else. If a message comes in on Slack or I need to check my email, I can click over to those apps, then use Stage Manager to go right back to my split-screen setup.\n\n(Yes, macOS also has a separate virtual desktop feature called Spaces, but I find Stage Manager easier to work with in this scenario.)\n\nStage Manager in macOS. Jared Newman / Foundry\n\nI realized that with Windows, I should be approaching Task View the same way, with split-screen layouts that correspond to specific tasks. My current setup now consists of four virtual desktops:\n\nWriting: Obsidian covers one half of the screen and Vivaldi covers the other.\n\nObsidian covers one half of the screen and Vivaldi covers the other. Communication: A three-column view with Slack, Gmail, and Proton Mail.\n\nA three-column view with Slack, Gmail, and Proton Mail. Socials: Full-screen views for BlueSky, Mastodon, and Threads.\n\nFull-screen views for BlueSky, Mastodon, and Threads. Other: Everything else on an ad-hoc basis, like gaming or any particular app that requires a clean layout.\n\nWithout Task View, these layouts would quickly fall apart as different apps overlapped and jockeyed for screen space. Assigning each layout to its own virtual desktop helps keep them intact.\n\nTask View isn’t a replacement for having multiple monitors (or an ultrawide monitor, for that matter). If anything, it’s more of a supplement, as you can quickly switch between layouts that span multiple screens (or one extra-wide screen).\n\nGetting more out of Task View\n\nJared Newman / Foundry\n\nHaving committed to using Task View, I’ve also made an effort to remember some of its extra features and shortcuts:\n\nWindows key + Tab , as I mentioned earlier, is the quickest and most convenient way to bring up Task View.\n\n, as I mentioned earlier, is the quickest and most convenient way to bring up Task View.

While Task View is open, you can drag windows from one virtual desktop to another.\n\nYou can also right-click an app and select “Show windows from this app on all desktops.” This is useful if you’re listening to music and want to control playback from any of the virtual desktops.\n\nIn Task View, right-click any virtual desktop to reorder it, rename it, or give it a unique wallpaper.\n\nIf you have a mouse with extra buttons on the side, you might also want to map those to Task View functions as well. With my Logitech MX Master 3S, I’ve mapped the two side buttons to flip between virtual desktops while the thumb button brings up the overall Task View.\n\nOne other option worth considering: In Windows, under Settings > Accessibility > Visual Effects, you may want to disable “Animation effects.” This turns off all the gliding and sliding animations, which can feel sluggish when switching between virtual desktops.\n\nSaving Task View layouts for later\n\nSaving my “Communications” layout with Workspaces. Jared Newman / Foundry\n\nWindows Task View pairs especially well with Microsoft PowerToys. PowerToys is a collection of helpful Windows utilities, including one feature called “Workspaces” for saving your favorite window layouts.\n\nI’ve used Workspaces to capture my Writing, Communication, and Social layouts, with quick-launch icons on my desktop for each one. If I need to reboot my computer, or if my layouts get messed up for any reason, this lets me restore them with one click. (You can read more about Windows Workspaces with this primer from Mark Hachman.)\n\nOf course, you can be perfectly happy using Windows without ever touching Task View — as I did for much of the last decade. But if you’re often juggling a few distinct tasks, it might be the organizational feature you’ve been missing.\n\nThis column first appeared in Advisorator, Jared’s weekly tech advice newsletter.

The human mind needs lots of reminders — lots of practice — to operate effectively. For example, deep down we know it’s OK to…\n\nSay “no”\n\nSpeak up\n\nTell the truth\n\nBelieve differently\n\nChange our mind\n\nPrioritize our needs\n\nLearn from our mistakes\n\nEmbrace our imperfections\n\nForgive and seek forgiveness\n\nBegin again, stronger than before\n\nYet, we often do the exact opposite when life gets stressful and we’re under pressure.\n\nWe do the wrong things even when we know better.\n\nBecause the human mind has weaknesses. It becomes forgetful and insensible when it’s stressed. And the only way to conquer these weaknesses is to practice conquering them. Yes, the mind is like a muscle, and just like every muscle in the human body it needs to be exercised to gain and maintain strength. It needs to be trained daily to grow and develop gradually over time.\n\nThe easiest strategy to practice strengthening the mind?\n\nEmpowering Quotes on Sticky Notes\n\nIt’s all about keeping the right thoughts front and center every day, so they’re readily available in those moments when you need them most. For Marc and me, that means pausing as often as necessary and reflecting on precisely what we need to remember. To make this practice seamless we write ourselves important reminders on sticky notes, like the ones digitally represented below, and then we put them up where we can quickly see and read them throughout the day (most of my sticky notes are up on the wall in my home office, and then I have a couple on my bathroom mirror and refrigerator too).\n\nOur sticky notes keep us on track by keeping our minds empowered with the right perspective. Through this daily practice Marc and I have ultimately learned that while you can’t always control the outer world, you can always choose to fill your inner world with strength, faith, peace, and love. And I’m sure you’ve learned something similar over the years from your own life experiences. But just like us, you often forget. Which is precisely why we have our sticky notes up where we can see them.\n\nSo my challenge to YOU is to start practicing alongside us. To get started, use the notes below — perhaps just the ones that resonate most — and rewrite them on physical sticky notes, so you can then stick them up where you can see and read them first thing every morning. Whenever you catch yourself feeling overwhelmed or off-center throughout the day, pause for a moment and quietly read them again to yourself. See how doing so gradually changes the way you respond to life in the heat of the moment…\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\n12.\n\n(Note: Most of the notes above are included in “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”.)\n\nYou can use different forms of visual notes too.\n\nWritten sticky notes like the ones we’re encouraging you to create are powerful, but they merely scratch the surface of possibilities for beneficial visual reminders. For instance, my phone, tablet, and laptop all have their backgrounds set to photos of my family, both because I love looking at them and because, when work gets really tough, these photos remind me of the people I am ultimately working for. It’s simple but it helps.\n\nI also know dozens of other people who successfully use similar visual reminders on a daily basis. A coaching client of ours who has paid off over $100K of debt in the past five years has a copy of her credit card balance taped to her work computer’s monitor; it serves as a daily reminder of both the progress she is grateful to have made, and debt she still wants to pay off. Another one keeps a photo of herself when she was 90 pounds heavier on her refrigerator as a reminder of the unhealthy lifestyle she never wants to go back to, and the gratitude she has for the changes she has made in her life.\n\nThink of moments when you are most likely to give in to impulses that keep you stuck or take you farther away from your best intentions. Then use written sticky notes and empowering visual reminders to interrupt those negative impulses, so you can keep yourself on track in a positive state of mind in the days ahead.\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nYes, it’s your turn to get some empowering notes up on the walls in your living and working spaces, so you can easily reference them. But before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂\n\nWhich sticky note or idea above resonates with you the most today?\n\nFinally, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week."}

With the Premier League crown potentially secured this week, attention is already turning to the transfer market. But Liverpool won’t be alone.\n\nAccording to CaughtOffside, “Liverpool are in the race to sign Bayer Leverkusen superstar Florian Wirtz, with Arsenal and City in the mix for the Germany international, who could leave the Bundesliga this summer.”\n\nThe 21-year-old has emerged as one of Europe’s standout young talents, playing a central role in Bayer Leverkusen’s title-winning campaign. “Leverkusen are resigned to losing Wirtz this summer, with the reigning German champions setting a price tag as high as €130m (£110m) for the 21-year-old attacking midfielder, who this season has again been exceptional.”\n\nInterest Across Premier League Elite\n\nLiverpool are no strangers to Wirtz, having been linked in past windows, but the Premier League’s financial powerhouses—Arsenal and Manchester City—are both circling. For Wirtz, a move to England feels inevitable, but the destination remains uncertain.\n\nWhile Liverpool may offer historic prestige and immediate momentum under Slot, Arsenal’s youthful project and City’s consistency present serious alternatives. Both clubs are expected to invest heavily after falling short in this season’s title race.\n\nAs CaughtOffside notes, “Liverpool have been linked with Wirtz in the past… though Arsenal and City’s interest does complicate matters for the Reds.”\n\nMidfield Spark Versus Structural Needs\n\nWirtz undoubtedly brings sparkle. His creativity, movement between the lines and capacity for unlocking deep defences would suit Slot’s vision for an expansive, modern Liverpool. He is, by many estimations, a future Ballon d’Or contender.\n\nYet, for Liverpool, it may be a case of priorities. With midfield not the most pressing concern this summer, spending a nine-figure sum on Wirtz could come at the expense of more urgent squad upgrades.\n\nAs the original report notes, “Liverpool need to address squad problems before targeting Florian Wirtz.” The defensive line, long praised for its balance and aggression, now shows signs of erosion. Injuries, ageing profiles, and form inconsistencies have exposed vulnerabilities, particularly in central areas.\n\nAttack Could Also See Major Rework\n\nEqually, the forward line is facing an uncertain summer. With both Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz linked with moves away from Anfield, Liverpool may need to reinvest in pace, finishing, and flexibility up front.\n\nWirtz, while more of a creator than a finisher, does bring attacking thrust. But would he be a luxury signing when other departments are in greater need?\n\nThat is the question Slot and the recruitment team must answer. Amid the romanticism of signing one of Europe’s top young stars lies the practical task of sustaining success in the most competitive league on the planet.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThere’s no doubt that Florian Wirtz is an exceptional footballer. Watching him glide past defenders in the Bundesliga, it’s easy to imagine him lighting up Anfield. He fits the DNA of a modern Liverpool attacker—technical, intelligent, driven.\n\nBut Liverpool supporters are pragmatists. While the lure of Wirtz excites, many recognise that money must be used wisely. With Konate’s contract situation unresolved, question marks over the full-back depth, and rumours swirling around the future of attacking players, the squad rebuild requires strategic thinking.\n\nFans also remember recent windows where marquee signings didn’t address underlying issues. If Wirtz is to join, it should be part of a larger, balanced plan—one that strengthens the core as much as it dazzles the crowd.\n\nFor now, the message from fans is clear: get the fundamentals right first. Then dream big."}

He could become a great centre-back, possibly one that could rival the greats.”\n\nSuch endorsement from a seasoned Premier League professional speaks volumes, particularly given the context of the match—an away day under immense pressure, with the title within touching distance. Konate’s performance was one of steel, composure, and intelligence—hallmarks of elite-level central defenders.\n\nSlot Faces Big Decision as Contract Talks Stall\n\nKonate’s contract, however, now presents Liverpool with a pressing concern. His current deal expires next year, and according to reports, discussions have yet to reach a breakthrough. In an era when top-class centre-backs are among the most prized assets, allowing Konate to edge toward free agency would be an extraordinary risk.\n\nLiverpool have already moved to tie down Virgil van Dijk, securing their captain’s leadership for the long term. They are also reportedly monitoring Juventus defender Dean Huijsen, signalling Arne Slot’s ambition to refresh and reinforce his defence this summer. But none of that negates Konate’s value.\n\nAt 25, the French international is entering his prime. His partnership with Van Dijk has matured beautifully this season, blending power and pace with tactical discipline.\n\nPraise Mounts Amid Defensive Evolution\n\nSlot’s side is evolving. Gone is the swashbuckling chaos of years past—what remains is a more methodical, balanced Liverpool team, built on a structured spine. Konate has been central to that shift.\n\nTony Adams, another Premier League defensive legend, praised Conor Bradley after the Leicester win, underlining the strength in depth Liverpool have at the back. But for all the promise shown by younger names, Konate’s presence remains pivotal.\n\nDeeney’s words reflect that: “He is switched on.” In moments of tension—like those seen late in games, or with a league title on the line—that trait is invaluable. Losing Konate now, or even entertaining offers next season, would be short-sighted at best, and catastrophic at worst.\n\nFuture Hinges on Retaining Defensive Core\n\nFor Slot, the challenge is to build on what he has, not undo it. Liverpool have shown glimpses of being the next dominant force in English football once again. Their manager’s tactical clarity, combined with emerging talents and seasoned leaders, sets the stage for another golden era at Anfield.\n\nBut keeping Konate is essential to that ambition. Letting him slip through their fingers would not only weaken their defence, it would signal an avoidable step backwards—particularly in a league where fine margins determine titles.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool fans, Konate is more than just a defender—he’s a symbol of what this side is becoming: composed, powerful, modern. His reading of the game, physical dominance and evolving relationship with Van Dijk have made him indispensable this season.\n\nSupporters will remember how long it took to find the right partner for Van Dijk after Dejan Lovren and Joel Matip’s inconsistency. Now that harmony has finally been achieved, the notion of losing Konate just as he hits top form is maddening.\n\nIf the club is serious about success under Arne Slot, Konate must be at the centre of that project. Fans understand contracts are complicated, but Liverpool’s board cannot allow this one to slip. As Deeney put it—Konate could rival the greats. But only if he’s given the platform, and the commitment, to stay and achieve that status in red."}

With a potential £95 million double raid on Bournemouth in the works, the Reds are firmly positioning themselves for another reshuffle, this time at the back.\n\nDean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez are reportedly at the top of Liverpool’s wishlist, according to a report by Lewis Steele in the Daily Mail. The club’s decision-makers are moving quickly, aware of fierce competition for both players and keen to shore up a defence that’s seen its stability wobble in recent seasons.\n\nThis isn’t a speculative link—it’s calculated. The club recently held a high-level recruitment meeting and confirmed their intentions to be aggressive in the summer market. Up to five new faces could arrive at Anfield before the next season kicks off.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LewisSteele_/status/1915001814488944743\n\nCentre-Back Revamp in Motion\n\nDean Huijsen, just 20, may be playing at Bournemouth now, but he’s already been linked with the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal, and even Real Madrid. Scouts admire his blend of “old-school defensive traits” and composure on the ball. He’s a rare hybrid: physical, smart, but modern in possession.\n\nThe Spain international, who previously represented the Netherlands at youth level, has a £50 million release clause. That hasn’t stopped clubs queuing up. Chelsea are believed to be leading the chase, but Liverpool remain firmly in the race.\n\nLiverpool’s interest in Huijsen makes football sense. With Virgil van Dijk ageing, Ibrahima Konaté out of contract in 2026 and yet to agree an extension, and Joe Gomez attracting external interest, the spine of the defence is beginning to look fragile.\n\nAs Lewis Steele notes: “If Huijsen ends up elsewhere, it feels like this is the summer for Liverpool to upgrade the centre half department.” A potential fallback could be Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite, but Huijsen clearly fits the profile Arne Slot wants—a player ready now, with years of growth ahead.\n\nWhy Kerkez Could Be the Key to Left Back Evolution\n\nOn the left, Milos Kerkez is the other name in the frame. At around £45 million, he’s not cheap—but the Hungarian full-back comes with pedigree and chemistry. He’s a close friend of Dominik Szoboszlai and has settled quickly into the Premier League.\n\nAndy Robertson has been an outstanding servant, but at 31, Liverpool have to think about long-term succession. Kostas Tsimikas, while reliable in rotation, hasn’t nailed down a claim to the shirt. Kerkez, in contrast, could challenge from day one and push the level higher.\n\nArne Slot is reportedly eager to “upgrade that area of their defence”, and Kerkez ticks the boxes. He’s technically sharp, aggressive in duels, and already has top-flight experience.\n\n🚨𝗜𝗡𝗙𝗢: Bournemouth are interested in Kelleher, Harvey Elliott and Ben Doak, @LewisSteele_. pic.twitter.com/9I4Kd4DpMj — LFC Transfer Room (@LFCTransferRoom) April 23, 2025\n\nLiverpool-Bournemouth Axis: Not a One-Way Street\n\nWhile Liverpool look to bring in from Bournemouth, the Cherries have their eyes on several Reds players. With Profit and Sustainability rules in place, these won’t be straightforward swaps—but the potential for multiple deals exists.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher is the most likely to depart. With Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving this summer and Alisson firmly No 1, Kelleher is expected to push for first-team football elsewhere. Bournemouth are a strong candidate, especially with Kepa Arrizabalaga’s loan from Chelsea set to end.\n\nHarvey Elliott and Ben Doak are also being monitored. Elliott’s return from injury hasn’t sparked the minutes he’d hoped for, and while Liverpool still value him, interest is growing. Doak, meanwhile, made an impression on loan at Middlesbrough and looks like one Liverpool may only sell for a high fee.\n\nThis could shape up to be one of those rare transfer windows where two clubs do significant business together, strengthening and rebuilding simultaneously.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nIt’s hard not to get a little excited reading what Lewis Steele has reported. Two young, promising players with clear upside? Sounds like the sort of smart business we’ve done well with before. But there’s also caution here—because we’ve seen targets slip through our fingers when bigger financial packages are on offer elsewhere.\n\nDean Huijsen is the type of centre-back we should be signing now, not waiting for later. He’s composed, technically gifted, and already has experience in Serie A and the Premier League. If we hesitate, Chelsea or Real Madrid will swoop in. Simple as that.\n\nKerkez, too, feels like a forward-looking choice. Robertson’s given us everything, but his best years might be behind him. Having Kerkez push or even replace him could be the kind of competitive jolt our backline needs. Plus, the Szoboszlai link can’t hurt when it comes to settling in.\n\nWe’d love to see a striker come in too—especially if Nunez doesn’t rediscover his finishing. But defence must come first. With so many of our current centre-backs either unsettled or ageing, it’s crucial we sort that spine now. If we land Huijsen and Kerkez early, it would send a real message that Arne Slot means business.\n\nLet’s just hope we don’t wait too long to act. These windows have a way of closing fast."}

As reported by Miguel Delaney in The Independent, the 19-year-old Spain international is now “seriously considering Chelsea” following the Blues’ bold offer of a seven-year contract, paired with a fast-track move ahead of the Club World Cup.\n\nFor Liverpool and Arsenal, long linked with Huijsen, this is a bitter pill. While the Reds have remained active behind the scenes — with Fabrizio Romano noting their willingness to meet the £50 million release clause — it’s Chelsea’s decisive move that may prove the clincher.\n\nThis isn’t just a transfer. It’s a statement of intent.\n\nPremier League Battle Intensifies for Defensive Prodigy\n\nWhat makes Huijsen such an intriguing prospect isn’t just his ability to play out from the back or his maturity at such a young age — it’s the context of his rise. A senior Spain debut at 19, commanding presence for Bournemouth, and a maturity echoed in his own words:\n\n“I don’t think it’s easy to play for Liverpool, it’s not,” Huijsen said on the Papa Pincus podcast.\n\n“There’s pressure, there’s the whole world looking at you, there’s Champions League, Premier League. You need to be good, like proper good to hold your own.”\n\nThat awareness has seemingly made Chelsea’s pitch even more appealing. Their offer comes with guarantees — performance-based incentives and a clear route into the first team. Liverpool, by contrast, have a crowded defensive stable, with established names and budding talents already vying for minutes.\n\nTiming and Vision Give Chelsea the Edge\n\nChelsea’s approach — swift, calculated, and tailored — puts them in pole position. Aligning Huijsen’s arrival with the Club World Cup in July isn’t just good PR; it’s a tactical manoeuvre to accelerate his integration and elevate their brand on a global stage.\n\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid’s retreat from the chase, largely due to budgetary constraints and the emergence of Raúl Asencio, narrows the battlefield to the Premier League. For Huijsen, this simplifies the decision but amplifies the stakes. Stay in England, and the path to stardom remains wide open — but the choice of destination could define his career.\n\nLiverpool’s Dilemma as Focus Splits\n\nFor Liverpool, this situation is reminiscent of past frustrations in the transfer market — admirers, but not closers. The Reds’ focus remains split: a title run-in, internal contract renewals, and the long-term planning under Arne Slot.\n\nThis isn’t an unfamiliar crossroads. Liverpool were similarly well-positioned for Jude Bellingham before Real Madrid swooped. Now, history could repeat itself unless the club pivots quickly.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a Liverpool fan’s perspective, this one stings — not because Huijsen’s gone to Chelsea yet, but because it feels like another one slipping through the net. We’ve seen this before. Top talent available, price known, interest clear — but Chelsea, with their new-age contracts and marketing strategies, get there first.\n\nHuijsen’s quotes make it obvious he respects Liverpool and understands the pressure of playing for a club of this magnitude. That alone is a rare thing in a 19-year-old. But respect doesn’t win transfers — decisiveness does.\n\nIt’s fair to say our recruitment under Klopp was intelligent and precise, but under Slot and new management, fans expect more bite. If Chelsea are offering long-term deals with first-team pathways, maybe we need to adapt too. Because missing out on another generational talent, especially one already admiring our standards, would feel like more than just poor timing — it would feel like a misstep in vision."}

As confirmed by Lewis Steele in his Liverpool Confidential column for the Daily Mail, talks over a new contract for Ibrahima Konaté have ground to a halt.\n\nThis time last year, few would have predicted such an impasse. Fabrizio Romano had suggested in October 2024 that both player and club were aligned in their intentions: Konaté was “fully expected” to commit his future to Liverpool, with advanced negotiations hinting at an imminent deal.\n\nSix months on, however, the silence is deafening. The centre-back, a key figure since his arrival from RB Leipzig, is now entering the final 12 months of his current contract. The situation, once considered routine, has drifted into uncertainty.\n\nWage Expectations Disrupt Harmony\n\nAt the heart of the standoff lies money — or rather, the idea of what constitutes value. Konaté, reportedly on £80,000 per week, is said to be asking for £200,000 per week to renew. That figure would place him alongside the club’s highest earners and significantly above many of his peers in the backline.\n\nThere is no doubting his pedigree: dominant in the air, composed on the ground, and often the quickest man in red when tracking back in transition. Yet there remains a lingering question mark over his fitness and availability. Can Liverpool justify such a wage leap for a player whose contributions, while vital, are often interrupted by injury?\n\nLewis Steele’s report pulls no punches: “Ibrahima Konaté is out of contract next summer with zero progress made in recent months in terms of an extension.” He adds that the uncertainty is not isolated to Konaté: “Aside from captain Virgil van Dijk, all of Liverpool’s central defenders have slightly uncertain futures.”\n\nImplications For Arne Slot’s Defence\n\nIt is not just a contractual issue — it’s a structural one. With Van Dijk extending until 2027 and Joe Gomez attracting outside interest, Liverpool could be in danger of losing key rotational depth and continuity. Jarell Quansah, impressive in spells, is still learning the game.\n\nArne Slot, still relatively early in his Anfield tenure, might find himself needing to reconstruct his defensive unit far sooner than expected. The dream scenario would see Konaté stay, develop further, and eventually take the mantle from Van Dijk. But Liverpool are running out of time to turn that into reality.\n\nTime Ticking For Both Sides\n\nIf Konaté wants to be seen as the defensive linchpin in Liverpool’s next great side, this moment could define his trajectory. Conversely, Liverpool must decide if the Frenchman is worth the financial outlay or whether a sale — while there’s still market value — is more prudent.\n\nWith top-level centre-backs always in demand, Liverpool risk allowing a vital asset to slip away with no return. Worse still, it would send a message that their next phase under Slot could start on the back foot, rather than with a consolidated spine.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs fans, we’ve seen this pattern before. Contract sagas dragging deep into a player’s final year rarely end well — and when they do, it usually requires concessions Liverpool are reluctant to make. Konaté is a unique defender, blending strength, pace, and anticipation. But his injury record is part of the discussion, and his wage demands reflect a self-image that might not yet match what he’s delivered on the pitch consistently.\n\nThe club’s transfer and contract policy has often been praised for being smart, but here’s a situation where smart might need to be more flexible. We don’t want to see another Emre Can or Gini Wijnaldum scenario play out. Fans want to believe that the club has learned from those mistakes. Let’s hope they act like it."}

It demands answers — sharp, timely, unflinching. And at Liverpool, the questions around this summer’s transfer window are not just urgent — they are defining.\n\nArne Slot, now almost a full glorious season into his Anfield tenure, has ushered in control, structure, and a return to rhythm. But rhythm alone doesn’t win titles. The squad needs not reinvention, but reinforcement. And in an era when the line between ambition and overreach is as fine as ever, how Liverpool strengthen will matter as much as who they bring in.\n\nThis is not a summer for PR-led war chests. This is a summer for exactitude.\n\nQuality Over Quantity – Summer Signings Must Be Right\n\nThere is a tired myth in football that the volume of signings reflects intent. It doesn’t. Quality is not found in quantity. Liverpool’s primary needs are targeted: a true number nine who can convert moments into margins, a right-back with defensive nous, and a left-back capable of marrying athleticism with tactical intelligence. Anything beyond that is bonus territory.\n\nThe name Hugo Ekitike has been thrown around recently — tall, quick, technically interesting. But having looked closely, there are warning signs. He underperforms his expected goals. His finishing is inconsistent. And what’s worse, he feels like Darwin Núñez all over again — potential packaged as unpredictability. Liverpool have already bought that profile, and the scars are fresh. Ekitike might click at another club, but Anfield cannot be the proving ground for another striker learning his trade under scrutiny. Not now.\n\nIf Liverpool are going to spend big, it must be on certainty, not hope.\n\nThe Díaz Dilemma\n\nLuis Díaz remains one of the most gifted players in the squad — but that doesn’t mean he’s untouchable. There’s a difficult conversation to be had here, not based on form, but on value. He’s approaching the point in his contract — and his age curve — where Liverpool must decide whether to extend or extract.\n\nIf the right offer arrives, particularly from a Barcelona or Saudi outfit, it would be derelict not to consider it. Because in truth, Díaz’s game hasn’t evolved significantly. He dazzles, yes — but the final ball still flatters to deceive, and for a side moving toward system over spontaneity, he may not be essential.\n\nReplacing him is another story — one that might involve someone like Nico Williams, a winger with upside, pace, and tactical discipline. But that only works if Liverpool are willing to do what they’ve done in the past: sell well, reinvest smart.\n\nThe Bournemouth Blueprint\n\nWhich brings us to the news this week: a potential £95 million double-swoop on Bournemouth’s Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen.\n\nKerkez — a full-back who carries, overlaps, and plays with verve — is more than just Szoboszlai’s mate. He’s a profile player for what Slot wants: press-resistant, progressive, capable of both inverting and flying forward. Robertson has given everything to this club, but time catches everyone. Kerkez could be the passing of the torch.\n\nHuijsen, meanwhile, excites in a quieter way. Elegant on the ball, composed under pressure, and already capped by Spain at 20. He fits the archetype of the modern centre-half but doesn’t forsake the art of defending. And if Liverpool are going to move on from Joe Gomez or accept that Ibrahima Konaté may not extend, Huijsen makes sense. He’s raw, yes. But, if Konate’s contract delays continue, and a sale is forced this Summer; then he’ll be better than anything Liverpool currently carry beyond Van Dijk.\n\nThat Chelsea and Arsenal want him too only adds weight.\n\nSelling With Intelligence, Not Emotion\n\nAny Liverpool transfer conversation must be twinned with exits. Not out of financial desperation, but strategic clarity.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher is too good to sit behind Alisson for another year. If Bournemouth want him, and a decent fee arrives, he should go. No fuss. No failure. Just a good player finding his own path.\n\nHarvey Elliott? More delicate. He’s had moments. He’s loved. But stylistically, he doesn’t quite fit what Slot’s midfield demands. If an offer comes that reflects potential and profit, Liverpool should take it seriously.\n\nBen Doak is one to watch. High ceiling. Championship-proven. But if he’s not going to play — and can fund something bigger — his sale becomes a lever, not a loss.\n\nThis is how Liverpool thrivedin Michael Edwards’ first tenure: making the hard calls when they’re still in control of the narrative.\n\nBeyond Numbers: Strategy and Structure\n\nThe thing that often gets lost in transfer fever is that football clubs are not fantasy teams. They are machines. And the best ones, like the best engines, operate on balance, not excess.\n\nSlot’s Liverpool don’t need to tear down the house. But they do need to reinforce its foundations. Bringing in Kerkez and Huijsen doesn’t just strengthen depth — it signals that the club is building with age profile, system fit, and adaptability in mind.\n\nAnd when the Núñez chapter inevitably closes, the next forward must not be a replica with better PR. He must be the kind of striker who turns possession into points, not headlines into hypotheticals.\n\nThe Window, The Way Forward\n\nThis summer isn’t about changing Liverpool’s identity. It’s about protecting it — and accepting the reality that big players will leave, and bold replacements must arrive.\n\nIt’s close to certain that Darwin Núñez will move on. His flashes of promise have not outweighed the inconsistency, and Liverpool cannot afford another season of missed margins in front of goal. The club needs a striker who finishes, not just one who sprints.\n\nAnd while all eyes are on incomings, the expected departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid demands immediate, strategic action. You don’t just replace Trent — you redesign how your entire right-hand side functions. Whoever comes in at right-back must not only be defensively sound but capable of stepping into a new tactical role. It’s the most seismic change of the Slot era so far.\n\nSuddenly, the need for two or three signings has shifted. This now looks like a four or fiveplayer window, with additions needed at right-back, left-back, centre-half, centre-forward — and hopefully even in midfield, depending on further outgoings.\n\nBut the principle remains the same: each signing must fit. Each one must make Liverpool better, not just busier.\n\nKerkez and Huijsen? They would be smart additions. Díaz and Núñez? Their time might be up. Trent? Irreplaceable in style, but not in position. And for that reason, Liverpool must think bigger, sooner, smarter.\n\nSlot doesn’t need 11 new players. But he does need five proper ones. Five that turn a good team into a great one.\n\nThe window isn’t open yet. But Liverpool’s work? It’s already begun."}

The judge clearly took time to write for people not mind-warped by legal education. But the format and conventions of court docs alone can put people off. Here’s a line-by-line, giving my own thoughts along the way.\n\nI am not an immigration lawyer, or even a lawyer who handles court cases. I advise and negotiate clear of court, and pride myself on keeping clients out of there. It’s still part of my job to follow and understand what the courts are doing, especially the written decisions of judges that come out of them. But it’s not any part of my day-to-day to know all the twists and turns of court procedure, much the less the state of the metagame in any particular area. Still, I’m hardly the only lawyer peering over to follow this case.\n\nIf you’re already up to date on the Supreme Court’s rulings, you can jump right to the line-by-line of the opinion.\n\nIf you’re short on time, but want the context, skip the front matter and go right to the order.\n\nHeader\n\nFiled: April 17, 2025 United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\n\nThe hierarchical structure of US federal courts has three major levels: district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court. The middle-tier courts are called “circuit courts” because judges used to travel around, or “ride a circuit”, to hear appeals from cases of the district courts within a given territory. These days circuit court judges mostly stay put, working out of their own permanent courthouses.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit covers federal districts in the states of Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. Abrego García lived and was arrested in the District of Maryland, and he sued in federal district court there.\n\nDistrict courts are trial courts. That’s where people submit papers to start lawsuits, submit evidence, hold trials, and get decisions.\n\nNo. 25-1404 (8:25-cv-00951-PX)\n\nThese are tracking numbers for the case. The first is from the Fourth Circuit, for the appeal. You can use the second, longer, -cv- number to track the case as it bounces around between different courts and levels of the system. My favorite repository is Court Listener, whose page for the case is here. The official government site is PACER, but it’s shamefully pay-gated and stubbornly baffling to use.\n\nParties\n\nAfter the numbers come the names of the parties—the two sides of the lawsuit.\n\nKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia;\n\none of the Salvadoran nationals deported to El Salvador\n\nFederal courts, their secretaries, and their case management systems still haven’t figured out how to type diacritics, but some are getting better at Spanish-style surname conventions. So no “García”, con acento, but we’ll see him called “Abrego Garcia” below.\n\nJennifer Stefania Vasquez Sura;\n\nAbrego García’s wife\n\nIt’s written Vásquez in Spanish. On that, I’m done.\n\nA.A.V., a minor, by and through his next friend and mother, Jennifer Vasquez Sura,\n\nIt’s typical for minor children and some other categories of vulnerable people to be named with pseudonyms or initials in court documents.\n\nPlaintiffs – Appellees,\n\nThis was the list of people who brought the lawsuit. So in that lawsuit, down in the federal district court, they are the “plaintiffs”, on the legal offense. But in this appeal to the Fourth Circuit above, they are “appellees”, on the defense. The government wants the appeals court to overturn what the trial court did. Abrego García, his wife, and his daughter, through their lawyers, want it upheld.\n\nv.\n\nWe’ll see the relevant hierarchy of the federal executive branch on the other side:\n\nKristi Noem;\n\ncurrently serving United States Secretary of Homeland Security, head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\nTodd Lyons;\n\nacting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, an agency under the Department of Homeland Security\n\nKenneth Genalo;\n\nacting Executive Associate Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations, ICE\n\nNikita Baker;\n\nacting Field Office Director for ICE in Baltimore, Maryland, where Abrego García lived and was arrested\n\nPamela Jo Bondi;\n\nserving United States Attorney General, head of the Department of Justice, where lawyers representing the federal government work\n\nMarco Rubio,\n\nserving United States Secretary of State, head of the Department of State responsible for foreign relations\n\nDefendants – Appellants.\n\nThese were the “defendants” at the trial court level, since they’re the ones who got sued. But they’re the “appellants” at the appeals court level, since they’re the ones asking to overrule the district court.\n\nType\n\nOrder\n\nCourts and judges turn out a few different kinds of documents. This is an order. The court is ordering something be done.\n\nJudges\n\nNext comes the bit identifying who is doing the ordering. And the writing that goes with it.\n\nWilkinson, Circuit Judge,\n\nJames Harvie Wilkinson III, 80 years old, appointed by Ronald Reagan to the Fourth Circuit in 1984, chief judge there since 1996\n\nwith whom King\n\nRobert Bruce King, 85 years old, appointed by Bill Clinton to the Fourth Circuit in 1998\n\nand Thacker,\n\nStephanie Thacker, 59 years old, appointed by Barack Obama to the Fourth Circuit in 2012\n\nCircuit Judges, join:\n\nSo Wilkinson authored the order, but King and Thacker agreed with it and cosigned it. There may have been feedback or other collaboration between them, behind the scenes, but it comes out under Wilkinson’s name.\n\nThree judges considering an appeal as a group are called a “panel”. Sometimes, one of the judges will agree with the decision they take as a group, but for different reasons, and file a separate opinion called a “concurrence” that gets tacked on after the main opinion. Sometimes one of the judges will disagree with other two and file a separate opinion called a “dissent” that also gets tacked on. We don’t have any concurrence or dissent on this decision. All three judges on the panel signed on to Wilkinson’s decision and his writing about it.\n\nOrder\n\n¶ Upon review of the government’s motion, the court denies the motion for an emergency stay pending appeal and for a writ of mandamus.\n\nAlas, our first course is a jargon salad. As we’ll see, it’s traditional to start and end an order like this with succinct but cryptic sentences saying what the court is ordering, in the bureaucratic language of the lawsuit game. We’ll power through now, then things will get a lot easier.\n\nA motion is a document filed by one side or the other in a lawsuit, asking the court to do something. There’s a whole decision tree of what motions who can file when. That’s “legal procedure”.\n\nIn this particular appeal, the government filed the motion. They asked for “emergency stay” of an order by District of Maryland trial court judge Paula Xinis, appointed by Obama in 2016. That order required the administration to “facilitate and effectuate the return of Plaintiff Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the United States by no later than 11:59 on Monday, April 7, 2025”.\n\nEssentially, the government asked the appeals court to press pause on that order while they argue that it’s legally wrong. They also want another order from the appeals court down to the lower court, a “writ of mandamus”, canceling, or “vacating”, a different trial court order giving Abrego García and family access to documents and evidence from the government to help prove their case, a process called “discovery”.\n\nThree judges for the Fourth Circuit said no. Why?\n\nBackground: Supreme Court Decisions So Far\n\nThe Supreme Court has given three decisions on the deportations to El Salvador now, one specifically in Abrego García’s case before Xinis. It’s worth reviewing them all very briefly. All district court and circuit court judges are bound to follow these decisions from the higher court, which can hear appeals of their decisions and overrule them.\n\nThese decisions have also been subjects of some of the most depressingly lazy and slanted news coverage I’ve seen in a long time. Partly this is down to the press just doing what it usually does on legal stories, now on some more particularly important ones. Partly this is down to the Supreme Court playing subtly. But only very partly.\n\nHow to Sue to Fight Getting Deported\n\nThe Supreme Court’s first, April 7 decision came in a case before before James Boasberg, 62, appointed by George W. Bush to the superior court in DC in 2002, then by Obama to the federal district court for DC in 2011, who made news for ordering the government to turn the planes back to the USA. The Supreme Court’s order runs only four pages, not counting the separate, individual opinions tacked onto the back of it. My takeaways were:\n\nThe deportees brought their case to the Supreme Court in the wrong legal way. They should have used “habeas corpus”, which we’ll get to later. This didn’t seem legally wrong to me, but fits nicely into a long pattern of federal courts avoiding direct conflict with other branches of government by finding narrow, technical ways to decide cases with much broader implications. There was a good law review article about this back in 2018. It’s really long, but its key points get covered in the abstract. Since they were held in Texas at the time these detainees sued, they should have sued in Texas, not in DC. This vindicated the government’s apparent “forum shopping” strategy of arresting people all over and immediately transferring them to Texas. Federal districts in Texas are under the Fifth Circuit, where the government expects judges to rule in its favor more often. People the government wants to deport under the Alien Enemies Act, the legal power Trump gave for deporting to El Salvador, have to be notified and given a chance to sue—in the right way, in the right court—to stop it. In other words, due process still applies, even though the Alien Enemies Act gives the president a lot of power to deport.\n\nHow to Order the Government to Bring Somebody Back\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Abrego García’s case came just a few days later, on April 10. The prompt was the government’s request to throw out the order of the Maryland district court judge commanding the government to “facilitate and effectuate” his return. My takeaways:\n\nThe Supreme Court acknowledged that the judge’s deadline for returning Abrego García had already passed by the time they got around to deciding. But they specifically left the rest of the order, minus the deadline, in place. “The order properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.” The word “effectuate” in the lower court’s order, on the other hand, needed clarification, to avoid overstepping into the executive branch’s role. This is what we call a “separation of powers” issue. The courts can order agencies and officers to follow the law, but it can’t take over actions or decisions that the law leaves to other parts of the government. “For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.” This left open the possibility of ordering the government to report on progress, as well as to sanction for failure to follow that order. That is now a live-fire issue in the first case the Supreme Court ruled on, in DC.\n\nI’m not an expert in immigration law, or even in litigation. But I’d long ago gathered it’s standard to leave an order like Xinis’ in place while it’s appealed. The general idea is that the judge on the front line, running the trial in the district court, gets latitude to manage the process, keep things on track, and make initial decisions. If a trial court gets an order wrong, an appeals court can correct it. But until they do, those on the receiving end must wait, obey, and respect the process. Appeal is about correcting orders, not requiring higher-level sign-off for them in the first place.\n\nThis is related to another hot legal issue since Donald Trump’s inauguration: the ability of federal trial court judges to rule that government actions are unconstitutional or otherwise illegal and order the government to stop, not just within the district where their court is, but all throughout the country. Your search term there is “nationwide injunctions”. An injunction is a kind of court order to one of the sides in a lawsuit: do this, don’t do that.\n\nMidnight Order to Pause More Deportations\n\nFinally, there was yet another Supreme Court decision over this weekend, in a new case. This case was brought out of Texas on behalf of more detainees, this time in the legal way the Supreme Court earlier said was the right one, habeas corpus. Pushing midnight, the Supreme Court issued a short order, without any written explanation, prohibiting the government from deporting any detainees falling into the “class”, or open-ended group, that the suit was brought on behalf of. Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito disagreed and later published a dissent.\n\nNote that the Supreme Court made this order after the Fourth Circuit wrote and published the order we are reading here together. I include it just to make this list complete, for now.\n\nWe’ve got the Supreme Court context. Now we’re ready to for the meat of the Fourth Circuit’s order in the Abrego García case.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe government asked the appeals court to overturn the district court’s order to “facilitate” and “effectuate” returning Abrego García, as well as its order to make the government share evidence for his lawsuit against the government. As we saw in the first, jargon-leaden sentence of that order, the Fourth Circuit said no. The government lost. Now comes the reasoning.\n\nThe relief the government is requesting is both extraordinary and premature.\n\n“Relief” here means “what they are asking the court to do for them”.\n\nWhile we fully respect the Executive’s robust assertion of its Article II powers, we shall not micromanage the efforts of a fine district judge attempting to implement the Supreme Court’s recent decision.\n\nArticle II of the US Constitution is the big part covering the powers of the executive branch, led by the president. Congress and the judiciary have their own articles, too.\n\nThe appeals court calling the district court judge below a “fine district judge” is a clear response to recent public criticism of judges by the president and his allies. John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, took the rare step of responded more directly, and publicly, after calls to impeach Boasberg for his order to turn planes around, in the first case the Supreme Court ruled on.\n\nIt is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter. But in this case, it is not hard at all. The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done.\n\nThis is unusually direct, serious language for an appeals court ruling. I read a judge who is trying to pierce through legalese to write something he expects will be read and quoted beyond the usual audience of lawyers and specialists.\n\n“Rid itself of custody” here refers to the government having handed Abrego García off to Salvadorian authorities in El Salvador.\n\n¶ This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\n\nCandidly, this is why this particular companies-contracts-privacy-security-IP lawyer has been following the paperwork on these cases.\n\n¶ The government asserts that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a member of MS-13. Perhaps, but perhaps not. Regardless, he is still entitled to due process.\n\nI read this as a direct response to the efforts of the presidential administration to “try him in the press”: repeatedly saying that he is a member of MS-13, holding pressers about him, publicizing the paper trails of his immigration process and domestic drama.\n\nOne of the benefits of trying someone in the press is lower standards of evidence. You can show and tell things that would never fly in court. You don’t even have to argue the same questions.\n\nEven if the government had already proven to a jury, beyond any reasonable doubt, that Abrego García was a gang member and a criminal, even if he’d admitted all that under oath, he’d still be entitled to due process of law. There’s nothing in the Supreme Court’s decisions that separates Abrego García, who was or wasn’t a gang member, from those who were, proven or unproven. Everybody gets due process.\n\nIf the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.24(f) (requiring that the government prove “by a preponderance of evidence” that the alien is no longer entitled to a withholding of removal).\n\nThe judge made an effort to write plainly above, but seems to lapse back a bit here. In American English, I’d put it so: “If the government’s so sure it can prove Abrego García’s a terrorist and an MS-13 member, it should go to immigration court, prove it, and get the order it violated against deporting him back to El Salvador canceled”.\n\n“8 C.F.R. § 208.24(f)” is a legal citation, a weird shorthand layers use to refer to other documents. This one refers to the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 8, Section 208.24(f). The Code of Federal Regulations is where the federal government compiles all the various regulations written by agencies.\n\n“Preponderance of the evidence” is a legal term for one of the “standards of proof”, vague but extremely important ideas about how strongly one side or the other of a lawsuit has to prove its case to get a judge or jury to rule in its favor. “Preponderance of the evidence” is the lower standard used by the courts. Criminal courts use the higher “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard, as required by the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe implication here is that the government wouldn’t even have had that hard a case to make to get the order against deporting Abrego García overturned. It would have been on legal Easy Mode, not Hard Mode, as if it were charging him with a crime.\n\nMoreover, the government has conceded that Abrego Garcia was wrongly or “mistakenly” deported. Why then should it not make what was wrong, right?\n\nA Justice Department lawyer admitted both in court and in a filing that ICE deported Abrego García despite knowing about its order against deporting him to El Salvador. That lawyer, Erez Reuveni, was soon suspended for not “zealously advocating”, lawyer speak for not playing tough enough.\n\n¶ The Supreme Court’s decision remains, as always, our guidepost.\n\nThis is preemptive self-defense. The government seems intent on appealing every chance it gets. All paths up lead to the Supreme Court.\n\nThat decision rightly requires the lower federal courts to give “due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.” Noem v. Abrego Garcia, No. 24A949, slip op. at 2 (U.S. Apr. 10, 2025); see also United States v. Curtiss-Wright Exp. Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 319 (1936).\n\nThe string of names, abbreviations, and numbers is another legal citation. The first pointer is to the Supreme Court’s decision in this case, specifically page 2 of it. Then there’s another, to an older Supreme Court decision about the president’s foreign policy role and powers.\n\n“Slip op.” stands for “slip opinion”. That’s how lawyers cite recent court opinions that haven’t been been bound up in the big books, or “reporters”, that decisions get formally published in. Think preprints, but in the legal system. The reporter for Supreme Court decisions is “United States Reports”, abbreviated “U.S”. The older Curtiss-Wright decision was published in volume 299 of United States Reports, starting on page 304. It was decided in 1936, the number in parentheses.\n\nThat would allow sensitive diplomatic negotiations to be removed from public view. It would recognize as well that the “facilitation” of Abrego Garcia’s return leaves the Executive Branch with options in the execution to which the courts in accordance with the Supreme Court’s decision should extend a genuine deference. That decision struck a balance that does not permit lower courts to leave Article II by the wayside.\n\nAll this points back to the Supreme Court’s requirement that courts be careful ordering the government to “effectuate” getting Abrego García back out. By pointing out the freedom of choice and action the government still has while following the order, it makes the point that the courts aren’t trying to micromanage the executive branch, as if by remote control.\n\n¶ The Supreme Court’s decision does not, however, allow the government to do essentially nothing. It requires the government “to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.” Abrego Garcia, supra, slip op. at 2.\n\nOn theme of following the Supreme Court’s say-so, citing it again.\n\n“Facilitate” is an active verb. It requires that steps be taken as the Supreme Court has made perfectly clear. See Abrego Garcia, supra, slip op. at 2 (“[T]he Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.”).\n\nThe meanings of words can always be argued, but courts have rules for that, too. Not all arguments are good legal arguments.\n\nThe “supra” in the citation just means “cited already above”.\n\nThe plain and active meaning of the word cannot be diluted by its constriction, as the government would have it, to a narrow term of art.\n\nA very lawyerly sentence. Playing interpreter again, I might put this as “We can’t read the plain, broad, active word ‘facilitate’ in some weaker, more specific legal way.”\n\nLawyers call words and phrases with special meanings in law “terms of art”. Sometimes these words have meaning in everyday English, too, but also different meanings in law. For example, while “consideration” usually means thinking about something, in contracts law it refers to a basic rule that courts will only enforce private deals where both sides gave and took.\n\nSpeaking of multiple meanings, the court might have meant “construction”, a term of art for “how judges interpret words”, rather than “constriction”. But constriction makes sense, too.\n\nWe are not bound in this context by a definition crafted by an administrative agency and contained in a mere policy directive. Cf. Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 400 (2024); Christensen v. Harris Cnty., 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000).\n\n“ICE can’t tell us how to read the word in a press release.”\n\nLoper Bright was a very recent Supreme Court decision overturning a rule called “Chevron Deference”. Chevron Deference told courts to listen to agencies’ readings of ambiguous laws in many circumstances. That was a long-sought result for many Republican-affiliated interests, and one I wouldn’t have expected without Republican nominees becoming the majority on the Supreme Court. The big political implications have been in regulation, such as environmental regulation. But it’s a huge change to a fundamental rule with application across tons of laws and agencies.\n\nCiting it here, on immigration, could be read as a bit of zinger. Also more demonstration that they’re following the Supreme Court, not running rogue.\n\nThus, the government’s argument that all it must do is “remove any domestic barriers to [Abrego Garcia’s] return,” Mot. for Stay at 2, is not well taken in light of the Supreme Court’s command that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador.\n\n“Mot.” stands for motion. The citation is to the document the government filed asking to overturn the district court’s order.\n\nNote the emphasis on the Supreme Court again. The Supremes got to be very subtle in their writing. They didn’t have to spell out direct do-this-do-that commands to the government afresh and sign them, just leave what the trial court wrote “in effect”, with some notes. But it’s no stretch to say the Supreme Court gave the government a command. That was the effect of their words.\n\n¶ “Facilitation” does not permit the admittedly erroneous deportation of an individual to the one country’s prisons that the withholding order forbids and, further, to do so in disregard of a court order that the government not so subtly spurns.\n\nVery pointed now.\n\n“Facilitation” does not sanction the abrogation of habeas corpus through the transfer of custody to foreign detention centers in the manner attempted here.\n\nRepetition—“anaphora”—for emphasis.\n\n“Habeas corpus”, the way the Supreme Court said detainees need to sue to stop getting deported under the Alien Enemies Act, is an ancient, bedrock legal right to challenge being held or imprisoned by the government. Article I of the Constitution prohibits Congress from suspending it “unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it”. Wikipedia has an extensive entry on its history in the United States, including the few times it’s been suspended, most notably during and after the Civil War.\n\nAllowing all this would “facilitate” foreign detention more than it would domestic return.\n\nClearly tired of games about “facilitate”.\n\nIt would reduce the rule of law to lawlessness and tarnish the very values for which Americans of diverse views and persuasions have always stood.\n\nThe first of a few huge, unironic statements of broad principle. Most lawyers, even many judges, serve entire careers seemingly a long way off any case where this could be written without seeming over-dramatic.\n\nI try to imagine writing in this case, as a federal judge over 80 years old.\n\n¶ The government is obviously frustrated and displeased with the rulings of the court. Let one thing be clear. Court rulings are not above criticism. Criticism keeps us on our toes and helps us do a better job. See Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 24 (1958) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (“Criticism need not be stilled. Active obstruction or defiance is barred.”).\n\nCooper v. Aaron was the Supreme Court decision in the Little Rock Nine public school racial integration affair after Brown v. Board of Education. The syntax of the citation marks the quote in parentheses as coming from the court’s opinion in Cooper.\n\nCourt rulings can overstep, and they can further intrude upon the prerogatives of other branches.\n\nThey can step on the toes of Congress and the Executive, doing what the Constitution leaves up to them, rather than the courts. Separation of powers again.\n\nCourts thus speak with the knowledge of their imperfections but also with a sense that they instill a fidelity to law that would be sorely missed in their absence.\n\nThe idea that the senior judge of a federal appeals court is thinking about a nation without courts is deeply unsettling.\n\n¶ “Energy in the [E]xecutive” is much to be respected. Federalist No. 70, at 423 (1789) (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). It can rescue government from its lassitude and recalibrate imbalances too long left unexamined.\n\nGetting a little lofty now.\n\n“Lassitude” means tiredness or weariness. Borrowed from French. Like “plaintiff”, “defendant”, “appellant”, and “appellee”.\n\nThe knowledge that executive energy is a perishable quality understandably breeds impatience with the courts. Courts, in turn, are frequently attuned to caution and are often uneasy with the Executive Branch’s breakneck pace.\n\nI’d venture to guess Wilkinson isn’t only referring to the Trump administration here. He’s been an appeals court judge more than forty years.\n\n¶ And the differences do not end there. The Executive is inherently focused upon ends; the Judiciary much more so upon means. Ends are bestowed on the Executive by electoral outcomes. Means are entrusted to all of government, but most especially to the Judiciary by the Constitution itself.\n\nThere’s a kind of mirror-image view here of the Supreme Court’s picking at “effectuate”. One response to charges that the courts are overreaching into executive business is that the courts are only ordering what has to be done, not how to do it. Go get Abrego García out. Take your pick of “options in the execution”—ways of getting it done. Keep negotiations secret if you want to.\n\n¶ The Executive possesses enormous powers to prosecute and to deport, but with powers come restraints. If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?[Footnote]\n\nFootnote: See, e.g., Michelle Stoddart, ‘Homegrowns are Next’: Trump Doubles Down on Sending American ‘Criminals’ to Foreign Prisons, ABC News (Apr. 14, 2025, 6:04 PM); David Rutz, Trump Open to Sending Violent American Criminals to El Salvador Prisons, Fox News (Apr. 15, 2025, 11:01 AM EDT).\n\nWhen it comes to basic legal rights, there is always a latent risk of further, more serious abuse. It takes the form of a slippery-slope argument, which is a relatively weak form, but one also rich in grim historical precedents. Drama put it perhaps better than life in the famous devil dialogue of Bolt’s A Man for All Seasons. We are about to get it again, from a senior federal appeals judge.\n\nAnd what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present, and the Executive’s obligation to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” would lose its meaning. U.S. Const. art. II, § 3; see also id. art. II, § 1, cl. 8.\n\n“And, when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you—where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?”\n\n¶ Today, both the United States and the El Salvadoran governments disclaim any authority and/or responsibility to return Abrego Garcia. See President Trump Participates in a Bilateral Meeting with the President of El Salvador, White House (Apr. 14, 2025). We are told that neither government has the power to act. The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.\n\nCalling out the runaround.\n\n¶ The basic differences between the branches mandate a serious effort at mutual respect. The respect that courts must accord the Executive must be reciprocated by the Executive’s respect for the courts. Too often today this has not been the case, as calls for impeachment of judges for decisions the Executive disfavors and exhortations to disregard court orders sadly illustrate.\n\n“Get what you give.”\n\n¶ It is in this atmosphere that we are reminded of President Eisenhower’s sage example. Putting his “personal opinions” aside, President Eisenhower honored his “inescapable” duty to enforce the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education II to desegregate schools “with all deliberate speed.” Address by the President of the United States, Delivered from his Office at the White House 1-2 (Sept. 24, 1957); 349 U.S. 294, 301 (1955). This great man expressed his unflagging belief that “[t]he very basis of our individual rights and freedoms is the certainty that the President and the Executive Branch of Government will support and [e]nsure the carrying out of the decisions of the Federal Courts.” Id. at 3. Indeed, in our late Executive’s own words, “[u]nless the President did so, anarchy would result.” Id.\n\nC-SPAN has their recording of the address on YouTube, if you’re interested.\n\n¶ Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both. This is a losing proposition all around. The Judiciary will lose much from the constant intimations of its illegitimacy, to which by dent of custom and detachment we can only sparingly reply. The Executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions. The Executive may succeed for a time in weakening the courts, but over time history will script the tragic gap between what was and all that might have been, and law in time will sign its epitaph.\n\nI think “dent” should be “dint” here, personally, but that’s courts moving quickly for you. All of this has happened at remarkable speed.\n\n¶ It is, as we have noted, all too possible to see in this case an incipient crisis, but it may present an opportunity as well. We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos. This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.\n\nSkirting the term “constitutional crisis”. I share a kind of allergy to that term. It’s way more clear that it means “big drama” than anything more specific. It’s more igniter than useful fuel. Authors writing earnestly about it nearly always define it some new way, for themselves, if they don’t just avoid it altogether. But I’m not aware of a better term for irreconcilable conflicts between branches of government.\n\nThe point above was “get what you give”. The court seems to follow that rule in deed, by ruling against the administration haranguing it. But in word, it offers an olive branch here.\n\nA huge open question, hardly legal, here: How will those meant to receive the offer read it? As an “opportunity”? Or only as a sign of weakness?\n\n¶ In sum, and for the reasons foregoing, we deny the motion for the stay pending appeal and the writ of mandamus in this case. It is so ordered.\n\nThe traditional procedural sign-off, mirroring the summary at the top.\n\nFor the Court /s/ Nwamaka Anowi, Clerk\n\n“/s/” is for “conformed signature”. It’s the law’s way of showing in type that a signature appears here in the original. In this case, the court clerk’s.\n\nThoughts\n\nYou’ve read this post for the court’s words, not mine. But the point is where we go from here, what we think about it.\n\nI can follow all the docs and read them carefully. I can’t pretend to guess all the whys, all the motives, on any side.\n\nStill, it strikes me that the government presented this issue in a very particular way. It looks like a production of impact litigation—the planning of legal cases and arguments for the purpose of changing public policy, not just winning particular fights. Whether by accident or design, it’s the dramatic evil twin of the “perfect plaintiff” civil rights suit, where activists purposed to find and sue for the most sympathetic victim possible, using their story to make the case for rights for all.\n\nFor one, this is all tangled deep in knotty legal process, largely as a result of how fast the government moved and how fast the courts had to move to keep up with it. The latest Supreme Court order came out at midnight with no attached explanation. That makes the substance hard to see, tempting even judges trying very hard to speak plainly and directly back into native gobbledygook. And it might yet get worse if the administration keeps defying orders and ends up in contempt. If you think “facilitate” versus “effectuate” gets technical, wait ‘til see you what the headline mongers do with “can the president pardon civil contempt?” or “does the Appropriations Clause let courts fine agencies big money?”\n\nI also struggle to think of an area of law that commands less respect, from all sides, than immigration. Tax, perhaps. We’re seeing politicization there, too.\n\nAs for the people, can you think of a group commanding less public sympathy right now than hundreds of Central American immigrants, tarred as violent foreign gang members, forcefully made to look all the same, crammed into a four-story cage, and stood up, shirtless, as backdrops for photo ops?\n\nClearly, the decision to round men up in mass, flood the media with conclusive assertions they are gang members, and deport them to a foreign prison with a practiced media team was intentional. Their sheer number defies individualization and empathy. It likely still does, for the vast majority of the hundreds flown away.\n\nBut one, Abrego García, fell out of the bundle. Because his lawyer acted blindingly fast, suing in Maryland before they moved him to Texas. Because his wife, a citizen and confident English speaker, took to the press. Because the government had ordered itself specifically not to send him back, did anyway, and had to admit it.\n\nA fearsome PR war is being waged to stuff Abrego García back into the group, to dissolve his story in the acid bath of demonized company: just another gang member, one of the horde. But even accepting gang-or-no-gang as the point to be won or lost diverts from the issue that matters.\n\nThere is no “law enforcement says they’re bad” exception to due process of law. Due process exists, and matters, precisely for when you’re accused, to force higher standards of argument, evidence, and proof between the will to point a finger and the power to impose consequences. It’s a bulwark between arbitrary will and the awful powers of the state.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, you’ve read one far more qualified judge and one far more qualified playwright say that already, in their own words. But our greater point, I think, is that we hope and pray you never needed to hear it from us in the first place.\n\nThe need for these high standards cries out not just from the sadder pages of history, but from your own sore memories of times you were wrongly judged or punished out of malice, callousness, laziness, or haste.

This week, he returns for the BBC‘s Louis Theroux: The Settlers, which launches in a few days’ time. Writing exclusively for Deadline, Theroux details how he took a “perpetrator focused” approach to the doc, discusses the complexities of covering the region and argues why the “world has amply demonstrated its ability to withstand what is happening in the West Bank.” He also pays tribute to Oscar winner No Other Land and questions why the pic was accused of antisemitism.\n\nLate last year, I spent three weeks travelling up and down the occupied West Bank — the region on the Eastern edge of Israel, which for nearly 60 years has been under Israeli military occupation. I was there documenting the world of the Israeli ultra-nationalists who have settled there, illegally under international law. My aim was to observe them up close, to try to understand their mind-set and their actions, and to get a sense of the impact of their presence on the lives of the millions of Palestinians who live in the region.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nI’d made a documentary in the West Bank once before, in 2010. At that time, I was struck by the way in which a group of people were able to pursue an openly expansionist ethnonationalist vision while enjoying the benefits of a separate and privileged legal regime to those around them and being protected by the Israeli army.\n\nThat programme, titled Ultra Zionists, went out on the BBC in 2011. I went on to other stories. But late in 2023, in the wake of the deadly attacks on October 7 and the ensuing devastating war, I began reading articles in the New Yorker, the New York Times and elsewhere suggesting that with the world’s attention on Gaza, the settler community had cranked up its activities. There were reports that settlers, issued with thousands of assault weapons by the government, were running rampant, harassing and intimidating Palestinians, torching their shops and homes.\n\nFilming took place in two blocks. Based in Jerusalem, and working with a team with years of experience covering the politics of the region, I met and interviewed settlers and their leaders – including the woman known as the “Godmother” of the settler movement, Daniella Weiss. I made several visits to settlements, including one called Evyatar, which had been authorized by the Israeli government just a few months earlier (it remains illegal under international law). Our first leg of filming took place during the olive harvest, a time when tensions run high, with the army – for alleged security reasons – preventing Palestinians from reaching trees they say they’ve harvested for years. I filmed interactions between the army, the olive pickers, and the peace activists (many of them Israeli) who work with the Palestinian farmers. I also made a visit to the ancient biblical city of Hebron, where settlers moved in illegally in 1968 and now live in a militarized zone of occupation.\n\nFilming of this kind carries risks. Some are physical. Others are reputational. The narratives around Israel and the Palestinians are fiercely contested. No piece of coverage will please everyone. In general, I try not to over-worry about how my reporting will be received. I trust my instincts. I accept mine is just one contribution in the vast offering of coverage. Others are valid. Not to mention that I am not a typical journalist and certainly not a current affairs reporter. I have my own way of tackling my subjects, driven by my own personal curiosity. What I can offer is my take.\n\nI have a style and an approach, which, for good or ill, I’ve made my own. You could call it “perpetrator focused.” I try to hear from those at the heart of a story who, broadly speaking, are viewed as being “in the wrong.” Naturally, giving airtime to these people can lead to accusations of “platforming.” I understand the charge. My decision to film means potentially millions will be exposed to the views of people who may be racist or fundamentalist or bigoted.\n\nBut making a documentary isn’t just a matter of handing someone a megaphone and saying “have at it.” It’s a process of asking the right questions, challenging, contextualizing. Doing journalism. I believe that, if done in a way that is considered and forensic, this approach gives viewers access to attitudes and ideologies that is more powerful for being unmediated. The settlers’ outlook – their beliefs, openly anti-democratic and supremacist, as they sometimes are – is seen for what it is.\n\nThere are also risks associated with drawing attention to forms of exclusionary nationalism when they are perpetrated by people who, in this case, are part of a minority group with its own long blood-stained history of enduring persecution. I have made several films that document antisemitism, including one that looks at its resurgence in the social media era. It’s been one of the most troubling aspects of our new media landscape that it has led to such a vast and toxic onslaught of antisemitic content.\n\nBut it should go without saying that extremists and ideologues exist in all communities. No one should get a pass. And when they are backed up by those in power, it’s a dangerous combination. It would also be a mistake to allow a phalanx of religious nationalist settlers and their far-right political supporters in government to co-opt Jewish identity and to write off legitimate criticism of their beliefs and their actions as an expression of bigotry.\n\n‘No Other Land’: “exceptional film-making can be subject to attack”\n\n(L-R) Basel Adra and Yuval Abraham in ‘No Other Land’ Yabaya Media/Dogwoof/Everett Collection\n\nNevertheless, I accept that some may see my documentary as anti-Israel. While making my film, I had the good fortune to watch the brilliant documentary No Other Land. To find out that the film, while picking up a string of awards including an Oscar, was accused of antisemitism was a cautionary lesson that even the most exceptional film-making can be subject to attack. In their case, some of it was physical: one of its co-directors, Hamdan Ballal, was a victim of mob settler violence, allegedly in response to the success of the documentary.\n\nOne of my reasons for wanting to go back, apart from changes in the region itself, was the sense that increasingly the wider world was looking to what is happening in Israel and the occupied territories for clues as to what their own future might look like. Some global populist leaders view the ideology of the settler community as a prototype for a type of nationalism they would like to practise. They regard Israeli settlers as the tip of the spear of what they frame as a global war against Islam. The views expressed by some in the film are part of a much wider and increasingly powerful anti-democratic strain of thinking that is pushing back against notions of civil rights and the rule of law. And so there is renewed relevance to understanding what is happening in the West Bank.\n\nRecently I was asked how I thought the story would change in the future. I thought about how it had changed since my last visit, 15 years ago. The difference, I realised, was mainly one of degree – more harassment, more displacement, more death. It’s hard to say confidently that the situation is likely to improve. It’s a depressing thought. It was the French aphorist La Rochefoucauld who said, “We all have enough strength to withstand the misfortunes of others.” The world has amply demonstrated its ability to withstand what is happening in the West Bank."}

Since then, we have published 206 articles on Psychology Today in which we have extended discussions in the book regarding advances in clinical and preclinical science.\n\nThe principles of treatment we outlined in the book remain timely. However, substantial progress in available treatments has occurred over the last 15 years. We mention some of these developments below.\n\nBasic Principles of Psychiatric Treatment\n\nWe initially outlined seven basic principles of psychiatric care in Demystifying Psychiatry. These remain relevant today and bear repeating:\n\nAccurate diagnosis is important in determining appropriate treatment. Close communication between the treatment team and the patient is essential. Some symptoms require aggressive action, including emergency care. Things take time. The effective use of medications requires expertise on the part of the practitioner. Types of treatment should be tailored to a patient’s individual circumstances. As much as possible, patients should be involved in their own care.\n\nExamples of Major Treatment Advances\n\nSince we published Demystifying Psychiatry, basic and clinical neuroscience research has led to new treatments with novel mechanisms of action that differ from older treatments. Prior to these more recent advances, new treatments involved tweaking approaches that had been available since the 1960s.\n\nBelow, we list several new treatments that have become available for post-partum depression, treatment-resistant depression, and schizophrenia. Other novel treatments are on the horizon.\n\n1. Postpartum depression\n\nNeuroactive steroids, a new category of medications with rapid onset of action, have been shown to be very effective in treating this painful and potentially devastating disorder. Both intravenous (brexanolone) and oral (zuranolone) treatments were approved for clinical use. Because of the success and easier use of the orally active agent, the intravenous treatment was recently discontinued.\n\n2. Severe treatment-resistant depression\n\nMedications that work by influencing the glutamate neurotransmitter system are currently available. Such drugs include esketamine, an FDA-approved nasal spray; intravenous ketamine (off-label use); and an oral drug that combines dextromethorphan and bupropion. Ketamine-based drugs work much more rapidly than traditional antidepressants.\n\nAdvances in methods using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have made this form of neuromodulation treatment more effective and more broadly available. One example is the Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) that combines an aggressive form of rTMS with brain system mapping. SNT has shown promise in treating severe, treatment-resistant depression.\n\nThe availability of this treatment is limited, but it may offer life-saving care for those who haven’t responded to other treatments. Other forms of rTMS are also more routinely available for clinical use.\n\n3. Schizophrenia\n\nA recently approved medication, xanomeline-trospium, is effective in decreasing positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. This drug’s mechanism of action differs significantly from prior antipsychotic medications in that it directly influences the acetylcholinergic (muscarinic) neurotransmitter system.\n\nAdvances in Treatment Delivery\n\nBecause of the limited number of psychiatrists, many patients are still not able to be evaluated or treated by psychiatrists. Yet there has been progress in treatment delivery. Examples include:\n\nThe more routine use of telepsychiatry (including Zoom and other computer-based technologies) to reach patients at distant locations.\n\nThe increasing use of treatment teams that include psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, physician assistants, psychologists, and social workers.\n\nCollaborative care models that involve the integration of mental health professionals into the offices of primary care providers.\n\nReflections on the Past 15 Years of Psychiatry\n\nOver the past 15 years, much progress has been made in clinically relevant basic neuroscience research, especially involving neuroimaging and genetics, and in the development of new treatments and treatment delivery systems. Psychiatry has advanced from a specialty that was a distant cousin to other branches of medicine in the 1980s to a highly respected and critical branch of medicine. The field is now attracting some of the brightest clinically-oriented and research-oriented medical students, including those in combined M.D.-Ph.D. programs.\n\nIt is likely that we will continue to see major scientific and clinical advances addressing psychiatric disorders over the coming years, including new medications with unique mechanisms of action and computer- and internet-based forms of psychotherapy. While it is early in development, the advent of approaches based on artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise as well. These future advances can’t come soon enough for the substantial numbers of patients suffering from these serious and disabling disorders."}

The automotive giants saw an uptick in their stock value as the market responded to the Trump administration’s decision to spare the industry from some of the more burdensome tariffs, particularly those on car parts imported from China.\n\nThe move comes as a significant relief for the auto sector, which had been lobbying against the tariffs that were set to increase costs, disrupt supply chains, and potentially lead to job losses. While a 25% tariff on all imports of foreign-made cars will remain in place, the exemptions will alleviate some of the financial pressures by excluding car parts from additional tariffs on steel, aluminum, and imports from China aimed at countering fentanyl production.\n\nThis development represents a step back from President Trump’s aggressive trade policies, which have been under intense scrutiny over concerns of their impact on the US economy, including the potential to raise car prices significantly. The automotive industry executives have been vocal in their criticism of the tariffs, with Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) chair John Elkann recently warning about the risks to the American and European car industries due to the trade policy.\n\nThe concessions by the Trump administration are seen as an initial victory for the auto industry, which has been pushing for further exemptions. This news also indicates a broader trend of the administration offering carve-outs to favored industries after facing backlash from global markets and warnings of a possible US recession.\n\nRelated articles\n\nGeneral Motors and Ford shares rise following FT report on tariff exemptions\n\nB.

These conditions enable the creation of hypernuclei, nuclei containing protons, neutrons, and their heavier, shorter-lived cousins, hyperons, which consist of up, down, and strange quarks. Now, by studying these heavy-ion collisions, the ALICE Collaboration has measured—with a statistical significance of 3 sigma—a hypernucleus called antihyperhelium-4 [1]. The team’s measurements of that hypernucleus and others could constrain models of particle physics and of neutron stars.\n\nDozens of different hypernuclei have previously been detected. But their antimatter counterparts are much harder to make, and, until now, only two types have been seen. In 2010, the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York, spotted antihypertriton (which has one antiproton, one antineutron, and one antihyperon). Then in 2024, that team detected antihyperhydrogen-4 (one antiproton, two antineutrons, and one antihyperon). The ALICE Collaboration has made the next step-up in atomic number by observing antihyperhelium-4 (two antiprotons, one antineutron, and one antihyperon). The feat was possible because the ions collide at much higher energies at the LHC than at the RHIC.\n\nThe ALICE Collaboration measured the masses and production yields of hyperhydrogen-4 and hyperhelium-4 and their antimatter counterparts. The masses, which were all about 4 times that of a proton, and the yields were consistent with both predicted and previously measured values. The predicted yields were based on a particle-physics model called the statistical hadronization model, so the results confirm that this model can provide an accurate description of hypernucleus formation in heavy-ion collisions. Refinements to the model could help astronomers understand the impact of hyperons and other exotic particles on the internal structure of neutron stars.\n\nCorrection (24 April 2025): The text was corrected to clarify that the statistical significance of the measurement didn’t reach the 5-sigma threshold needed to claim a “discovery.”\n\n–Ryan Wilkinson\n\nRyan Wilkinson is a Corresponding Editor for Physics Magazine based in Durham, UK."}

Ochoa presented their prototype called the Newsroom Elves, which aims to improve efficiency in the print newsroom.\n\n\"The Editor’s Desk Elf converts press releases into stories with headlines and summaries.

If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here: https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized ! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.\n\nこれでPagerDutyリソースをプロビジョニングする準備ができました。\n\nPagerDutyのAPIキーは、対応するPagerDutyドメインが分からなくても利用できてしまいます。流出すると危険です。\n\nこういったクレデンシャル情報の扱いについて他のサービスと同様ですが、GitHubのパブリックリポジトリ上にアップロードしないための対策をしましょう。\n\n（対策例） provider.tf にAPIキーを埋め込まずに terraform.tfvars に記載する terraform.tfvars は .gitignore ファイルで管理し、Gitのパブリックリポジトリに誤って上げないようにする\n\n\n\nユーザー作成と通知ルールの設定をする\n\n準備ができたので、初めにPagerDutyのユーザーを作成し、ユーザーの通知ルールを設定します。\n\nカレントディレクトリに user-notification.tf を追加します。\n\nuser-notification.tf resource \"pagerduty_team\" \"engineering\" { name = \"Engineering\" description = \"All engineering\" } resource \"pagerduty_user\" \"example\" { name = \"Hiroaki Ashizawa\" email = \"example@example.com\" } resource \"pagerduty_team_membership\" \"example_engineering\" { user_id = pagerduty_user.earline.id team_id = pagerduty_team.engineering.id } ※ pagerduty_user.earline.email に記載のメールアドレスは受信可能なものに変更してください ※設定値は、PagerDuty Provider ドキュメントのExample Usageを参考にしています。 PagerDuty Provider | Terraform Registry\n\nterraform plan でDry-Runしてから、 terraform apply コマンドでリソースを作成します。\n\n> terraform plan .. .. .

Since being announced last April, about half of the films on the list are available now in the U.S. or are coming soon, either through traditional distro deals or bespoke rollouts. Not too shabby!\n\nWhat’s next? A whole new list, with 19 widely hailed features also seeking their well-deserved spotlight, in whichever form that might take.\n\n“Indie filmmakers are rewriting the distribution narrative. There’s a pervasive permission in the air, encouraging us all to consider avenues beyond a film school textbook,” said The Popcorn List co-founder Lela Meadow-Conner in an official statement. “Despite what clickbait would like us to believe, people are still showing up to independent movie theaters and direct to audience platforms for movies like ‘Hundred of Beavers’ and ‘No Other Land,’ two films that bucked tradition. … There’s never been a better time for filmmakers to take distribution into their own hands. Of this year’s recommendations, more than 50 percent of filmmakers are thinking about what that might look like.”\n\nIn 2025, TPL reached out to 45 film festival programmers, 30 of whom responded with their own recommendations. In total, 28 films were recommended (two films were recommended twice by two separate programmers), and the final list includes 19 films (plus seven films listed as “Special Mentions” due to their distribution plans). Also of note: this year’s list includes more narratives than documentaries (a switch from last year), and a majority of the films are directed by female directors and/or first-time filmmakers.\n\nCheck out the full list of titles included in this edition of The Popcorn List, with information and language provided by TPL and the participating programmers:\n\n“Ashima,” Dir.

Emotional and rooted in character, “Ashima” is a love letter not only to climbing, but to immigrant parents and the realization of the American Dream.\n\n“Brooklyn, Minnesota,” Dir. Jessica Blank, Erik Jensen (Meira Blaustein, Executive Director, Woodstock Film Festival)\n\nWhen the grandfather she never knew dies suddenly, headstrong 14-year-old Maisie and her artist dad Kurt leave the confines of their Brooklyn bubble to return to Kurt’s Minnesotan childhood home — where Maisie will upend old family patterns, fall in love, and force her family to confront each other and themselves.\n\n“Clocked,” Dir.

Jordan Wilkes, 29, from New Milton, attacked the girl, who was playing outside his flat with a friend, in August 2024. Bournemouth Crown Court heard data from Wilkes' phone showed he had researched James Bulger's murder and rioting after the Southport killings ahead of the attack. In a victim impact statement, the girl's mother said her daughter had developed post traumatic stress disorder and \"carries a life sentence of her own\".\n\nThe court heard the girl was not known to Wilkes before the attack, which happened at an address in Glider Close during the school holidays. She had been playing in a communal stairwell when Wilkes came out of his flat and stabbed her with a penknife three times, once to her jaw, then her shoulder and knee. The girl and her friend managed to get away and knocked on a number of doors before a neighbour took them in and called the emergency services. In arrest footage from Dorset Police, Wilkes can be heard directing officers to the attempted murder weapon in his bedroom. His DNA was later found on the handle of the penknife, while the victim's blood was found on the blade.\n\nJordan Wilkes was arrested by armed police after stabbing a nine-year-old girl\n\nProsecutor Berenice Mulvanny told the court the victim was taken to hospital and treated for her \"serious\" stab wounds, but the court heard she would be left scarred for life. The wound to her neck narrowly missed major arteries, which could have led to fatal blood loss if they had been cut, the court heard. Ms Mulvanny said a search of the defendant's home found a number of knives, several of which had been hidden around the premises. Analysis of his mobile phone revealed 69 files relating to YouTube videos, news articles and podcasts focused on murders and child killings. Ms Mulvanny said this included the so-called \"Valentine's Day massacre\" at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018 in which 17 people were killed. He had also looked up the rioting in the aftermath of the murder of three girls at a dance class in Southport in July 2024, and a day after the killings he had clicked on a link for a local dance class, the court heard.\n\n'Remarkable little girls'\n\nWilkes was found guilty after trial of one count of attempted murder and one count of possessing a bladed article on 7 March. Passing sentence, Judge William Mousley KC commended the two girls' bravery. He said: \"The conduct of two very brave little girls has been quite remarkable, in light of the ordeal they have been through.\" Wilkes was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment and an extended licence of five years for attempted murder. He received a sentence of two years' imprisonment for the posession of a bladed article to run concurrently.\n\nElizabeth Cook Court artist sketch of Judge William Mousley KC sentencing Jordan Wilkes at Bournemouth Crown Court\n\nSenior crown prosecutor, Kelly Newman, said Wilkes was a \"highly dangerous individual with an obscene interest in knives and violence\". She said: \"Examination of all the available evidence, particularly his disturbing online search history in the weeks before this attack, revealed his hideous intentions to kill and harm children. \"This attack represents every parent's worst nightmare – believing their child is innocently and safely playing, only to be targeted in such a horrific manner. \"We have been moved by the bravery of the victim and her friend throughout this process. We hope that they can begin to heal from such a terrifying ordeal.\"\n\n'Justice has been delivered'\n\nIn a statement the family of the victim said the trauma of the incident would be something they \"endure for the rest of our lives\". \"But be assured; although it has been extremely arduous, the resilience, bravery, endurance, strength, power, determination and much more our little girl has shown from the very seconds of the attack through to where we stand today; will continue to diminish his existence,\" they said. \"Justice has been delivered today and knowing this person's liberties have been withdrawn and children in our community are now safe from him; we can close out this chapter.\"\n\nYou can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook, , or Instagram."}

Cook", "fullContent": "A reader recently called to our attention the internet presence of a group called American Intelligence Media: Christians Addicted to Truth. Here is their web address.\n\nBelow is their logo:\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWe found while perusing their website that we at Three Sages share many of their perspectives. In particular, they are highly attuned to the British imperial project articulated by Cecil Rhodes and Nathaniel Rothschild around the turn of the 20th century dedicated to “recovering America for the British Empire.”\n\nIt was for this purpose that Rhodes left the profits from his South African gold and diamond empire, stolen from the original Dutch settlers and indigenous native peoples via the Boer Wars, to provide funding for two major projects.\n\nOne project was to create a fund for the education of promising youth in the goals and principles of British imperialism via “Rhodes scholarships.” Exemplary in this enterprise was Rhodes scholar and future US president Bill Clinton.\n\nThe second project was the creation of a “secret society” (Rhodes’s words) to accomplish the above-stated goal of recapturing the United States, a nation which had gained nominal independence in 1776 but never entirely succeeded in standing on its own two feet.\n\nThe “secret society” actually had multiple permutations, including, but not limited to the British Round Table, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), the Tavistock Institute, the Fabian Society, the (American) Council on Foreign Relations, the Federal Reserve System (aka, “the creature from Jekyll Island”), and, most importantly and perhaps least noticed, the Pilgrim Society.\n\nThe Pilgrim Society, founded in 1902 and still in existence, is a joint organization of British and US aristocrats whose objective is to actualize the merged interests of Anglo-American elites while, behind the scenes, it works toward the never-ending goal of world conquest.\n\nGoogle AI provides the following description:\n\n“Founded in 1902 by Sir Harry Brittain, this society is a British-American organization dedicated to promoting good relations and understanding between the United States and Great Britain.\n\nThe society’s members include influential figures from both countries, and it has played a role in fostering what has come to be known as the ‘special relationship’ between the two nations.\n\nThe Pilgrims Society holds regular events and gatherings, often in the form of lavish banquets, where members from both countries can network and engage in discussions on various topics of mutual interest.\n\nThe society’s activities have been documented in books and articles, offering insights into its role in shaping Anglo-American relations.”\n\nWikipedia states as follows:\n\n“Over the years it has boasted an elite membership of politicians, diplomats, businessmen, and writers who have included Henry Kissinger, Margaret Thatcher, Caspar Weinberger, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Henry Luce, Lord Carrington, Alexander Haig, Paul Volcker, Thomas Kean, George Shultz, and Walter Cronkite among many others. Members of the immediate Royal Family, United States secretaries of state and United States ambassadors to the Court of St. James’s are customarily admitted ex officio to membership in the Society. The Pilgrims of Great Britain and the Pilgrims of the United States have reciprocal membership.”\n\nReturning to where we began with reference to American Intelligence Media, this organization is particularly devoted to describing the role of the Pilgrim Society in the current world crisis marked by the outbreak of war in Ukraine, the Middle East, and elsewhere, with no public acknowledgement of where the impetus for so much violence comes from. Instead we have the daily avalanche of “fake news.”\n\nWithin the next few days we will begin to serialize Chapter 8 of my book Our Country, Then and Now entitled “Rule Britannia” as a contribution to an examination of the origin and meaning of what clearly has become World War III.\n\nIt is our contention that just as the British Empire suckered the US into World Wars I and II in order to carry out its desires to annihilate Germany, they are trying to do the same today by getting us to fight Russia, Iran, and China for similar purposes.\n\nAs a way to provide additional background, following is a recent article from the American Intelligence Media website entitled The Pilgrims Society: Subverting American Sovereignty Since 1902.

The lesson’s removal has sparked concern among civil rights and First Amendment organizations over a growing mandate for Texas schools to ban certain educational materials from libraries.\n\n“Nudity on a state flag is an absurd justification to censor a history lesson,” American Civil Liberties Union of Texas Staff Attorney Chloe Kempf told Hyperallergic. “Texans are enduring attacks on our freedom to read at every level of government — from school boards, to the State House, to the White House.”\n\nThe incident recalls the controversial ousting of a Florida elementary school principal in 2023 after an art teacher showed an image of Michelangelo’s famous nude sculpture “David” (1501–4) to 11- and 12-year-olds.\n\nA version of the Virginia state flag as designed by Charles Keck in 1931 (image via WikiMedia)\n\nHosted by the learning platform PebbleGo Next, the Virginia lesson included a module about the State Seal, adopted in 1776 at the state’s Constitutional Convention. The article explains that the seal depicts the Roman goddess Virtus stepping on a supine tyrant above the state motto “Sic Semper Tyrannis (Thus Always to Tyrants).”\n\nIn Virtus’s home state, the “appropriateness” of the flag, which didn’t feature the goddess’s nipple until 1901, has also been tested by school boards and local politicians.\n\nPebbleGo provides interactive nonfiction lessons in the form of articles, videos, and maps for the nearly 11,000 third through fifth graders in the district, according to LCISD’s website. To access the learning platform, students obtain a username and password through a campus librarian.\n\nAnne Russey, co-founder of the Texas Freedom to Read Project, told Hyperallergic in an email that her organization submitted a public information request on April 7 to the LSCID asking if any articles on the platform had been “turned off” for students.\n\nScreenshot from LCISD’s response to Texas Freedom to Read Project’s public records inquiry (courtesy Texas Freedom to Read Project)\n\nLCISD responded to the request on April 14, stating the district not only shut down a module on Virginia history on November 25 due to “frontal nudity,” but it also deleted a lesson on “Family Types” because the lesson violated a district-wide ban on materials related to “gender fluidity.”\n\nAccording to the Texas Freedom to Read Project, the school district amended its library materials guidelines days before the lesson was canceled to include a policy banning “visual depictions or illustrations of frontal nudity.” The updated policy was issued to comply with a controversial law that has been used to justify book bans, the organization said.\n\nThat law, the Restricting Explicit and Adult-Designated Educational Resources (READER) Act, also known as HB 900, prohibits Texas public school libraries from acquiring or maintaining “obscene” and “pervasively vulgar” materials. Critics of the law, enacted in September 2023, however, say the categories of banned content included in the law are too broad and could particularly affect books addressing LGBTQ+ topics and discussions on race and racism.\n\n“The sweeping and vague restrictions in bills like HB 900 can lead to government officials censoring books and ideas they don’t like,” Kempf told Hyperallergic. “This is an abuse of power that violates our constitutional rights and weakens our ability to learn about ourselves and the world around us.”\n\nIndividual school districts are taking it even further, Russey told Hyperallergic. In attempting to adhere to HB 900, LCISD has not only complied with the controversial law but has adopted even stricter guidelines.\n\nIn one extreme case last year, a Texas school district serving 11,000 students recalled the entire text of the Bible in an attempt to comply with HB 900. It was quickly reinstated after the district received “clarification” from Republican Texas Representative Jared Patterson, who sponsored the bill.\n\n“Banning the Virginia state flag is likely not the intent of any lawmakers or local school board trustees, but this is the reality we find ourselves in,” Russey said. “Texas parents who oppose book bans and censorship must speak up when they see problematic local policies and state laws, and advocate for reasonable, individual parent and student rights — not more government overreach and control.”"}
