The people running these scams have gotten much smarter, and they’re using tricks that your regular fraud tools might miss.\n\nIt’s a big business, and if you think you are not affected, you are wrong.\n\nHere’s what’s really happening to your ad budget: Real people in click farms are getting paid to click on ads all day long.\n\nThey use VPNs to hide where they’re really coming from, making them look just like normal customers. And they’re good at it.\n\nThe bots have gotten better, too. They now copy exactly how real people use websites: They move the mouse naturally, fill out forms like humans, and even make typing mistakes on purpose.\n\nWhen these smart bots team up with real people, they become really hard to spot.\n\nThe scammers are also messing with your tracking in clever ways. They can trick your website into thinking they’re new visitors every time.\n\nThey can make their phones seem like they’re in your target city when they’re actually on the other side of the world.\n\nIf you’re counting on basic click fraud protection to catch all this, you’re in trouble. These aren’t the obvious fake clicks from years ago – they’re smart attacks that need smart solutions.\n\nThat being said, the good old competitor trying to click 50 times on your ad is also still existent and not going away anytime soon.\n\nLuckily, it is safe to say that Google can spot and detect those obvious fraud clicks in many cases.\n\nGoogle’s Click Fraud Dilemma: Walking The Revenue Tightrope\n\nGoogle faces a tricky problem with click fraud.\n\nEvery fake click puts money in Google’s pocket right now, but too many fake clicks will drive advertisers away. This creates a conflict of interest.\n\nGoogle needs to show that it’s fighting click fraud to keep advertisers happy and the ad platform and all of its networks healthy, but it can’t afford to catch every single fake click.\n\nIf it did, its ad revenue would drop sharply in the short term because it also runs the risk of blocking valid clicks if it goes in too aggressively.\n\nBut if it doesn’t catch enough fraud, advertisers will lose trust and move their budgets elsewhere.\n\nSome advertisers say this explains why Google’s fraud detection isn’t as strict as it could be.\n\nThey argue Google has found a sweet spot where it catches just enough fraud to keep advertisers from leaving, but not so much that it seriously hurts its revenue.\n\nThis balance gets even harder as fraudsters get better at making fake clicks look real.\n\nThis is also why many advertisers don’t fully trust Google’s own click fraud detection and prefer to use third-party tools.\n\nThese tools tend to flag more clicks as fraudulent than Google does, suggesting Google might be more conservative in what it considers fraud.\n\nThe Over-Blocking Problem Of Third-Party Tools\n\nThird-party click fraud tools have their own business problem: They need to prove they’re worth paying for every month.\n\nThis creates pressure to show lots of “blocked fraud” to justify their subscription costs. The result? Many of these tools are too aggressive and often block real customers by mistake.\n\nOther tactics are to show lots of suspicious traffic or activities.\n\nThink about it. If a click fraud tool shows zero fraud for a few weeks, clients might think they don’t need it anymore and cancel.\n\nSo, these tools tend to set their detection rules very strict, marking anything slightly suspicious as fraud. This means they might block a real person who:\n\nUses a VPN for privacy.\n\nShares an IP address with others (like in an office).\n\nBrowses with privacy tools.\n\nHas unusual but legitimate clicking patterns.\n\nThis over-blocking can actually hurt businesses more than the fraud these tools claim to stop.\n\nIt’s like a store security guard who’s so worried about shoplifters that they start turning away honest customers, too.\n\nWhy Click Fraud Tools Are Still Valuable\n\nDespite these issues, click fraud tools are still really useful as a first line of defense.\n\nThey’re like security cameras for your ad traffic. They might not catch everything perfectly, but they give you a good picture of what’s happening.\n\nHere’s what makes them worth using:\n\nThey quickly show you patterns in your traffic that humans would take weeks to spot.\n\nEven if they’re sometimes wrong about individual clicks, they’re good at finding unusual patterns, like lots of clicks from the same place or at odd hours.\n\nThey give you data you can use to make your own decisions – you don’t have to block everything they flag as suspicious.\n\nThe key is to use these tools as a starting point, not a final answer. Look at their reports, but think about them carefully.\n\nAre the “suspicious” clicks actually hurting your business? Do blocked users fit your customer profile?\n\nUse the tool’s data along with your own knowledge about your customers to make smarter decisions about what’s really fraud and what’s not.\n\nIn terms of functionality, most third-party click fraud detection tools are somewhat similar to each other.\n\nA simple Google search on “click fraud tool” shows the market leaders; the only bigger difference is usually pricing and contract duration.\n\nTackling Click Fraud With Custom Solutions\n\nAfter getting a first impression with third-party click fraud tools, it’s best to build a collection of custom solutions to tackle your individual scenario.\n\nEvery business has a different situation with different software environments, website systems, and monitoring.\n\nFor custom solutions, it’s recommended to work closely with your IT department or developer, as many solutions require some modification on your website.\n\nThe Basics: Selecting An Identifier\n\nThere are a handful of solutions to cover 80% of the basics.\n\nThe first way to do something against click fraud is to find a unique identifier to work with.\n\nIn most cases, this will be the IP address since you can exclude certain IP addresses from Google Ads, thus making it a good identifier to work with.\n\nOther identifiers like Fingerprints are also possible options. Once an identifier is found, you need to make sure your server logs or internal tracking can monitor users and their identifiers for further analysis.\n\nThe Basics: CAPTCHAs\n\nAnother basic tool, which is often forgotten, is CAPTCHAs.\n\nCAPTCHAs can detect bots or fraudulent traffic. Google offers a free and simple-to-implement solution with reCAPTCHA.\n\nCAPTCHAs might seem like an easy answer to bot traffic, but they come with serious downsides.\n\nEvery time you add a CAPTCHA, you’re basically telling your real users, “Prove you’re human before I trust you.” This creates friction, and friction kills conversions.\n\nMost websites see a drop in form completions after adding CAPTCHAs if they are set too aggressively.\n\nSmart CAPTCHAs can limit the frequency, but not all CAPTCHA providers allow that option, so choose your provider or solution wisely.\n\nThe Basics: Honeypot Fields\n\nHoneypot fields are hidden form fields that act as traps for bots.\n\nThe trick is simple but effective: Add extra fields to your form that real people can’t see, but bots will try to fill out.\n\nOnly bots reading the raw HTML will find these fields; regular users won’t even know they’re there. The key is to make these fields look real to bots.\n\nUse names that bots love to fill in, like “url,” “website,” or “email2.” If any of these hidden fields get filled out, you know it’s probably a bot. Real people won’t see them, so they can’t fill them out.\n\nPro tip: Don’t just add “honeypot” or “trap” to your field names. Bots are getting smarter and often check for obvious trap names. Instead, use names that look like regular-form fields.\n\nAdvanced Validation Methods\n\nSmart Form Validation: Email\n\nMost businesses only check if an email address has an “@” symbol and looks roughly correct.\n\nThis basic approach leaves the door wide open for fake leads and spam submissions.\n\nModern email validation needs to go much deeper. Start by examining the email’s basic structure, but don’t stop there.\n\nLook at the domain itself: Is it real? How long has it existed? Does it have proper mail server records?\n\nThese checks can happen in real time while your user fills out the form. It should be noted, however, that smart form validation usually requires some sort of third-party provider to check the details, which means you need to rely on external services.\n\nA common mistake is blocking all free email providers like Gmail or Yahoo. This might seem logical, but it’s a costly error.\n\nMany legitimate business users rely on Gmail for their day-to-day operations, especially small business owners.\n\nInstead of blanket blocks, look for unusual patterns within these email addresses. A Gmail address with a normal name pattern is probably fine; one with a random string of characters should raise red flags.\n\nFor enterprise B2B sales, you expect bigger companies to sign up with their company domain email address, so blocking free mail providers might work.\n\nSmart Form Validation: Phone\n\nPhone validation goes far beyond just counting digits. Think about the logic of location first.\n\nWhen someone enters a phone number with a New York area code but lists their address in California, that’s worth investigating.\n\nBut be careful with this approach – people move, they travel, and they keep their old numbers. The key is to use these mismatches as flags for further verification, not as automatic rejections.\n\nThe Art Of Smart Data Formatting\n\nData formatting isn’t just about making your database look neat. It’s about catching mistakes and fraud while making the form easy to complete for legitimate users.\n\nName fields are a perfect example.\n\nWhile you want to catch obviously fake names like “asdfgh” or repeated characters, remember that real names come in an incredible variety of formats and styles.\n\nSome cultures use single names, others have very long names, and some include characters that might look unusual to your system.\n\nModify Your Google Ads Campaign Settings To Tackle Click Fraud\n\nGoogle offers multiple campaign options to increase reach, on the downside most of those options come along with an increase of click fraud activities.\n\nApp Placements\n\nPerformance Max campaigns can place your ads across Google’s entire network, including in apps. While this broad reach can be powerful, it also opens the door to potential fraud.\n\nThe challenge is that you have limited control over where your ads appear, and some of these automatic placements can lead to wasted ad spend.\n\nKids’ games are often a major source of accidental and fraudulent clicks. These apps frequently have buttons placed near ad spaces, and children playing games can accidentally tap ads while trying to play.\n\nWhat looks like engagement in your analytics is actually just frustrated kids trying to hit the “play” button.\n\nAnother issue comes from apps that use deceptive design to generate clicks. They might place clickable elements right where ads appear, or design their interface so users naturally tap where ads are located.\n\nThis isn’t always intentional fraud. Sometimes, it’s just poor app design, but it costs you money either way.\n\nUnlike traditional campaigns, where you can easily exclude specific placements, Performance Max’s automation makes this more challenging.\n\nThe system optimizes for conversions, but it might not recognize that clicks from certain apps never lead to quality leads. By the time you spot the pattern, you’ve already spent money on these low-quality clicks.\n\nExcluding app placements is for almost all advertisers a must have. Very few advertisers benefit from app placements at all.\n\nPartner And Display Network\n\nLead generation businesses face a unique challenge with Performance Max campaigns that ecommerce stores can largely avoid.\n\nWhile ecommerce businesses can simply run Shopping-only campaigns and tap into high-intent product searches, lead gen businesses are stuck dealing with the full Performance Max package, including the often problematic Display Network.\n\nThe Display Network opens up your ads to a mass of websites, many of which might not be the quality placements you’d want for your business.\n\nWhile Google tries to filter out bad actors, the display network still includes sites that exist primarily to generate ad clicks.\n\nThese sites might look legitimate at first glance, but they’re designed to encourage accidental clicks or attract bot traffic.\n\nSome are specifically designed for server bot farms, as they run on expired domains and have no content besides ads.\n\nLead generation businesses don’t have this luxury. Their Performance Max campaigns typically run on all networks except shopping. This creates several problems:\n\nThe quality of clicks varies wildly. Someone might click your medical practice ad while trying to close a pop-up on a gaming site. They’ll never become a patient, but you still pay for that click.\n\nSomeone might click your medical practice ad while trying to close a pop-up on a gaming site.

Imagine a law firm’s ad showing up on a site full of questionable content – not ideal for building trust with potential clients.\n\nImagine a law firm’s ad showing up on a site full of questionable content – not ideal for building trust with potential clients. Bot traffic and click farms often target display ads because they’re easier to interact with than shopping ads. You might see high click-through rates that look great until you realize none of these clicks are turning into leads.\n\nAll those are reasons to question PMax campaigns for lead gen, but that’s a decision every marketer has to make.\n\nAdvanced Google Ads Settings To Tackle Click Fraud\n\nIf the basics are implemented but there is still a higher amount of suspected click fraud, advanced solutions need to be implemented.\n\nBesides excluding suspicious IP addresses, you can also build negative audiences.\n\nThe idea is to have a second success page for your lead generation form and only forward potential bots or fake sign-ups to this page.\n\nTo achieve that, your website needs to evaluate potential bots live during the sign-up process.\n\nYou can then setup a dedicated “bot pixel” on the second success page in order to send data of this audience to Google.\n\nOnce enough data is retrieved, you can exclude this audience from your campaigns. This approach is a little trickier to implement but is worth the effort as those audience signals are of high quality if enough data is supplied.\n\nMake sure to only fire the “bot pixel” on the special success page and only there, otherwise you run the risk of mixing your audiences which would render the system useless.\n\nFiltering Fake Leads With Conditional Triggers\n\nAnother tracking-based strategy is to set up condition-based conversion tracking. Combined with hidden form fields, you can modify the conversion trigger not to send data if the hidden field was filled.\n\nIn that scenario, you would filter out bots from conversion tracking, sending back only real conversion to your campaign, and therefore, also training the Google algorithm and bidding strategy only on real data.\n\nYou eliminate a majority of fake leads and traffic with this setup.\n\nMaking Sign-Ups More Challenging To Improve Lead Quality\n\nAnother advanced strategy is to make the sign-up process a lot harder.\n\nTests have shown that much longer forms are not finished by bots because they are usually trained on simpler and shorter forms, which require only mail, name, phone, and address.\n\nAsking specific questions and working with dropdowns can dramatically increase the lead quality. It should be noted, however, that longer forms can also hurt the valid signup rate, which is a risk you want to take if you have to deal with bot and fraud traffic.\n\nA fitting case was a car dealer I worked with. They had a form where people could offer their cars for sale and retrieve a price estimate.\n\nA short form had almost three times the signup rate than before, but it turned out later that a lot of them were spam signups or even very low-qualified leads.\n\nA shorter form leads to more spam because it’s easy to sign up. After switching to a longer form, the signups dropped, but quality increased drastically.\n\nAlmost 20 fields long, and potential clients had to upload pictures of their car.\n\nIt took a few minutes to finish the signup, but those who did were committed to doing business and open to discussing the sale, which also made it easier for the salespeople to follow up properly.\n\nA Hard Truth About Lead Fraud\n\nLet’s be honest: You can’t completely stop lead fraud. It’s like shoplifting in retail – you can reduce it, you can catch it faster, but you can’t eliminate it entirely.\n\nThe fraudsters are always getting smarter, and for every security measure we create, they’ll eventually find a way around it.\n\nBut here’s the good news: You don’t need perfect protection. What you need is a balanced approach that catches most of the bad leads while letting good ones through easily.\n\nThink of it like running a store: You want security, but not so much that it scares away real customers.\n\nThe key is to layer your defenses. Use click fraud tools as your first line of defense, add smart form validation as your second, and keep a human eye on patterns as your final check.\n\nWill some fake leads still get through? Yes. But if you can stop 90% of the fraud, you’re winning the battle.\n\nRemember: Perfect is the enemy of good. Focus on making fraud expensive and difficult for the bad actors, while keeping your lead generation process smooth and simple for real prospects. That’s how you win in the long run.\n\nMore Resources:\n\nFeatured Image: BestForBest/Shutterstock"}

Combined with hidden form fields, you can modify the conversion trigger not to send data if the hidden field was filled.\n\nIn that scenario, you would filter out bots from conversion tracking, sending back only real conversion to your campaign, and therefore, also training the Google algorithm and bidding strategy only on real data.\n\nYou eliminate a majority of fake leads and traffic with this setup.\n\nMaking Sign-Ups More Challenging To Improve Lead Quality\n\nAnother advanced strategy is to make the sign-up process a lot harder.\n\nTests have shown that much longer forms are not finished by bots because they are usually trained on simpler and shorter forms, which require only mail, name, phone, and address.\n\nAsking specific questions and working with dropdowns can dramatically increase the lead quality. It should be noted, however, that longer forms can also hurt the valid signup rate, which is a risk you want to take if you have to deal with bot and fraud traffic.\n\nA fitting case was a car dealer I worked with. They had a form where people could offer their cars for sale and retrieve a price estimate.\n\nA short form had almost three times the signup rate than before, but it turned out later that a lot of them were spam signups or even very low-qualified leads.\n\nA shorter form leads to more spam because it’s easy to sign up. After switching to a longer form, the signups dropped, but quality increased drastically.\n\nAlmost 20 fields long, and potential clients had to upload pictures of their car.\n\nIt took a few minutes to finish the signup, but those who did were committed to doing business and open to discussing the sale, which also made it easier for the salespeople to follow up properly.\n\nA Hard Truth About Lead Fraud\n\nLet’s be honest: You can’t completely stop lead fraud. It’s like shoplifting in retail – you can reduce it, you can catch it faster, but you can’t eliminate it entirely.\n\nThe fraudsters are always getting smarter, and for every security measure we create, they’ll eventually find a way around it.\n\nBut here’s the good news: You don’t need perfect protection. What you need is a balanced approach that catches most of the bad leads while letting good ones through easily.\n\nThink of it like running a store: You want security, but not so much that it scares away real customers.\n\nThe key is to layer your defenses. Use click fraud tools as your first line of defense, add smart form validation as your second, and keep a human eye on patterns as your final check.\n\nWill some fake leads still get through? Yes. But if you can stop 90% of the fraud, you’re winning the battle.\n\nRemember: Perfect is the enemy of good. Focus on making fraud expensive and difficult for the bad actors, while keeping your lead generation process smooth and simple for real prospects. That’s how you win in the long run.\n\nMore Resources:\n\nFeatured Image: BestForBest/Shutterstock"}

I hear all these stories, all these articles, all the Trump voters, saying they regret what they did back in 2024.” Enten remarked. “I’m here to tell you, very few of them regret what they did back in 2024.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe data guru, citing a new poll from YouGov, said that for all the talk about buyer’s remorse, a repeat of last November’s election would likely end up with the exact same result.\n\n“We’re talking just 2%. That’s not even a wide spot on the road. And then there’s this additional 1% who say they would rather not vote.” Overall, less than 5% of Trump voters would even consider changing their vote, he explained.\n\nThe poll, conducted this month, also found near-identical levels of loyalty among Harris voters, suggesting there hasn’t been a serious swing in public opinion in either direction.\n\n”The bottom line is for all this talk of Trump voters regretting their vote in the numbers, it really just doesn’t show up,” said Enten. “If there’s some idea out there that Trump voters are going around, man, I wish I had voted for Kamala Harris instead of Donald Trump, the numbers say that is a fanciful universe. It really for the most part does not exist.”\n\nWhen asked about the “stickiness” of Trump voters compared to his first presidency by co-host John Berman, Enten revealed that more Republican voters held a more negative view of the president at this point in 2017 than they do in 2025.\n\n“In February 2017, four percent of Trump voters said they’d shift their vote—that’s actually slightly more than this time around. “So you know, you look back, you say, OK, there’s these Trump voters who really regret their vote. Historically speaking, they really don’t regret their vote,” he said. “And if anything, the number this time around is actually smaller than it was the first time around and it’s certainly smaller than the number we saw coming out of 2020, of course, after the events of January 6th.”\n\nCNN’s Data Guru Reveals How Many Trump Supporters Regret Their Vote CNN\n\nA similar poll conducted by CBS earlier this month saw Trump’s popularity plummet following his disastrous tariff policies, which Enten said at the time was “the worst poll that Donald Trump has received in his second term.” 54 percent of voters said Trump is responsible for the current economic downturn, and the president’s approval ratings are currently “underwater.”\n\nBut Enten was keen to point out that pitting two people’s popularity against each other produces a different result than asking to judge them in isolation—and that the president’s current unpopularity does not translate into electoral gains for the Democrats.\n\nHe also highlighted the fact that Republicans are currently enjoying a rare lead over Democrats in terms of party recognition, with a recent poll putting them at +2% satisfaction.\n\n“If anything, the Republican brand has actually perhaps gotten a smidgen stronger, though these are within the margin of error, very different from 2017 when Democrats held a 5 point advantage,” he explained. “And I’ll finally note this looks very much like the generic ballot trend, which in 2025 looks an awful bit like November of 2024 when Republicans, of course won and held the House.”"}

Nobody here advises Fielder to drink his grandson's urine, nor does anyone try to convince Fielder that every number he comes across is a sign from god. There are still some real-life oddballs Fielder meets, like a pilot who's been banned from every dating app or a woman who is fiercely attracted to Albert Einstein, but Fielder doesn't form a relationship with anyone in quite the same way he did with Angela or Remy in season 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what season 2 lacks in fun new guests, it makes up for in just how many treats there are for long-time Nathan Fielder fans. One storyline is based around Fielder's reflections on his 2023 Showtime drama \"The Curse,\" and another's based on a \"Nathan For You\" season 3 episode that was removed from Paramount+ due to its \"Holocaust Awareness\" gag. If you've had questions about real-life Fielder's thoughts on his past projects, season 2 answers (or at least, pretends to answer) a surprising number of them.\n\nThe most interesting bit of self-reflection from Fielder comes in the final few episodes, where he mentions he's been reading many of the articles and Reddit threads people write about him. (One of /Film's articles even gets a half-second shout-out in the penultimate episode.) Much like how he handles people face-to-face, Fielder reads the coverage of his show like an alien trying to understand human culture; he doesn't get what viewers are talking about when they compare his show's rehearsing premise to the life experiences of many autistic people, but he's willing to explore the idea to its full extent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeason 1 Nathan Fielder felt like a lonely scientist trying to find a secret formula for human connection; season 2 Nathan Fielder feels like a doctor trying everything he can to save his patient's life. The patient in question is America's troubling recent pattern of plane crashes, and not even Fielder is sure if he's up for the task. The result is a season that's not quite as boundary-breaking as the first, but which maintains a clearer sense of direction from start to finish. Season 1 started off as a simple idea that evolved into something bigger; season 2 knows exactly what it wants to be from minute one. Thankfully, for both the viewers and the real-life people involved, Nathan Fielder sticks the landing.\n\n/Film Rating: 9 out of 10\n\n\"The Rehearsal\" season 2 premieres on HBO April 20, 2025."}

In June 1925, a young physicist named Werner Heisenberg retreated to the barren island of Helgoland in the North Sea, seeking respite from his allergies. There, he scribbled down equations that would light an intellectual fire in Europe, eventually forming the basis of an idea that shook our view of how reality works to the core. That idea was quantum theory.\n\nIn recognition of the quantum centenary, the United Nations has designated 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. There will be celebrations, exhibitions and conferences all over the world.\n\nThis article is part of a special series celebrating the 100th anniversary of the birth of quantum theory. Read more here.\n\nIf you know only one thing about quantum theory, it is probably that it is “weird”. Indeed, the idea that the quantum world is too strange to fully understand has infected our culture. There are even products like cosmetics branded or described as “quantum”, a tacit signal that they have powers beyond our comprehension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea that the quantum world is too strange to fully understand has infected our culture\n\nIt is true that quantum theory paints a strange picture of the subatomic world – but to stop there would be to miss its true importance. In this centenary year, we should be celebrating the theory for its power and provocation – as we do in a trio of articles in this special issue.\n\nPhysicist Carlo Rovelli gives us his take on the origins of quantum mechanics and introduces its bold claims. We see how these ideas have revolutionised technology – and how they will continue to do so. And we explore the profound questions quantum theory forces us to ask about what “real” really means. The fact that it paints such an uneasy picture of the subatomic world hints that we are missing something about the workings of the universe – but new interpretations and experiments are inching us towards a fresh understanding.\n\nQuantum theory has been wildly successful, too. Few other scientific ideas have passed so many experimental tests. Its origins may hinge on a bout of hay fever, but it is a legacy not to be sniffed at."}

Your taxes are filed, or at least your extensions have been requested. But Americans filed taxes this week in the midst of an unprecedented upheaval of the nation’s fiscal system which was inaugurated a century ago. Headlines blare about President Donald Trump terminating or pushing out tens of thousands of IRS employees. Meanwhile the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is attempting to scale back the Justice Department’s Tax Division. Plus, the White House has called for the U.S. to use tariffs to replace the income tax. Taken together, these recent actions are combining to push for dramatic reversal of the decades-long process that built the American fiscal state a century ago.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTax laws and fiscal policies are the lifeblood of the modern state. They provide the federal government with the collective capacity to accomplish vital aims—from supporting retirees and subsidizing care for the disabled and the poor to protecting communities from crime and from foreign adversaries. Over a century ago, Americans advocated for an income tax to reallocate the financial burdens of funding a modern nation-state—one that would grow over time to provide badly needed public goods and services. For much of the 19th century, the United States lacked the institutional capacity to mount ambitious federal programs. Regressive tariffs and excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco were the main sources of federal revenue. Those revenues supported limited federal spending—on average only about 3% of gross domestic product compared to 23% today—for a few grudging investments in infrastructure. So-called “internal improvements” were mostly the domain of state governments. And with the exception of the Civil War, the military was tiny by comparison to those of the European powers.\n\nRead More: Paying Your Taxes Used to Be Patriotic In those early years, the tariff was not intended to raise significant revenue. It was principally meant to protect the country’s “infant industries” from foreign competition. Success in that endeavor meant, by definition, that tariffs would generate little revenue. Goods kept out of the U.S. market never generated duty payments at U.S. ports. Moreover, American protectionism soon began to diverge from its aims. Lawmakers increasingly used the protective tariff to pick winners in the marketplace, deciding which firms and which regions would benefit from duties placed on foreign rivals. The duty list became a tool for corruption and party self-dealing, a device for rewarding favorites and punishing enemies. The protective tariff also facilitated corporate consolidations. Vast holding companies arose at the end of the 19th century, shielded from foreign competition and run by industrialists who boasted previously unknown riches. Because import duties raised the prices of everyday goods while protecting the industrialist class, ordinary Americans rightly came to associate the tariff with rising inequality and with the gross concentrations of wealth that typified the first Gilded Age—and now plague our own.\n\nAnd so, a combination of agricultural interests, organized labor, and Progressive Era intellectuals demanded a new system of taxation to rein-in galloping inequality and support an expanded federal budget. Such pressure worked. Congress adopted its first peacetime income tax in 1894. When the U.S. Supreme Court struck it down a year later as unconstitutional, Americans responded by creating a social movement for what eventually, in 1913, became the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, authorizing Congress to lay and collect taxes on incomes. President Woodrow Wilson signed a new income tax into law later that same year, and the income tax has been with us ever since. From the start, the income tax at the heart of the new modern fiscal state consisted of “progressive” or “graduated” rates. Tax rates at higher income levels were higher than tax rates at lower income levels. And thus, more affluent Americans paid not only proportionally more taxes, but progressively more than others of more modest means. By the mid-20th century, the income tax, along with a whole host of developments in law and in the economy, helped blunt the excessive 19th-century economic inequality.\n\nBut in the U.S., federal taxes were not intended to radically redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor. Rather, the aim of the new taxes was to eclipse the tariff and to establish a system of public financing adequate to meet the needs of a modern nation. The new fiscal state sustained by the income tax created the financial foundation for twentieth-century American geopolitical power. U.S. fiscal capacity underwrote two successful world wars and a cold war nuclear arms race. It created the capacity for the host of public programs associated with the New Deal and Great Society. And it helped distribute more evenly the fruits of a post-World War II economic boom, reining-in the outsized wealth and influence of Roaring Twenties robber barons and contributing to the mid-century decades that witnessed the greatest equality of income and wealth in the past century of American capitalism.\n\nRead More: The Tariff History Donald Trump Is Overlooking\n\nToday, the achievements of the modern fiscal state hang in the balance. The tariff is back; the president says it is “the most wonderful word in the dictionary.” The Trump administration has levied a sweeping set of import duties against nearly all of our trading partners, including key allies in North America and Europe. Rather than using the tariff to protect American industry, as it previously had done, Trump is now using it to launch an all-out war on the very state capacity that once made America great. Trump has called on lawmakers to extend and make permanent his 2017 tax cuts—a plan that could cost $4.5 trillion and balloon an already unsustainable level of public debt. Aides at Elon Musk’s DOGE have gutted the IRS in ways that insiders believe will cost around $500 billion dollars, or around 10% of the federal government’s annual tax revenue, and hopes to further access the sensitive personal information of American taxpayers. The rate of tax audits is expected to plummet. And Homeland Security head Kristi Noem plans to leverage IRS data to help ICE's deportation efforts.\n\nThe modern fiscal state, with its taxation power, its legitimate coercive authority, and its sheer capacity, is arguably the only institution capable of countering the astonishing power of our billionaire robber baron oligarch class. It is no wonder, then, that the Trump White House has targeted its powers. Without it, we could return to a weaker, more unequal, and less democratic society.\n\nAjay K.

And along the way, I hope to write some interesting code.\n\nWhat’s the p-System?\n\nWay back in 1974-1978, computer scientists at the University of California, San Diego campus developed a new portable operating system, compiler, and tools to run on both the PDP-11 minicomputers and the increasingly-common microcomputers. They called this UCSD Pascal, and it was available for a wide variety of systems, in just a few years.\n\nThe secret to its wide portability was that the system sat “on top of” a very small kernel of machine-dependent code, which implemented a “virtual machine” called the “p-machine”, a kind of imaginary CPU specifically designed to be a good target for a Pascal Compiler. Because this was a relatively-small amount of code, it was possible to port the entire operating environment, including the operating system, the compiler, editor, filesystem and other tools, just by implementing the p-machine emulator for a new machine.\n\nYou could get a version of the p-System for a huge variety of computers. Besides DEC’s PDP-11 and Rainbow, there were versions for the Apple II, the IBM PC (one of 3 OS options for it at the start), for HP’s series 80 and series 9000 workstations, Texas Instruments’ TI-99/4a home computer, CPM machines, various mainframes, and on, and on. Western Digital even created a microprocessor that ran p-machine code as its native machine language.\n\nThe p-System was not the first portable byte-code interpreter and compiler system – that idea goes very far back, at least to the origins of the Pascal language itself. But it was arguably one of the most-successful early versions of the idea, and served as an inspiration for future portable software systems (including Java’s bytecode, and Infocom’s Z-machine).\n\nWhere did I first encounter the p-System?\n\nIn 1986, during my Junior year of High School, I took a Computer Programming class. That was primarily taught in BASIC, because of course it was. After completing that class, I was essentially let loose in the computer lab for a period of “Independent study” (thanks, Mr. Carlson!), and that was where I got to use Pascal for the first time. Apple Pascal, running on the Apple IIe. At that point, I was also using Pascal in my first after-school job, using UCSD Pascal on the HP 80 and 9000 series workstations, and also Turbo Pascal on IBM PC-compatibles (not the p-System, but definitely inspired by it).\n\nMy “final project” for my Senior year was building a spreadsheet program in Apple Pascal. I managed to get a formula editor, including basic arithmetic functions, the grid display, and printouts all working before I graduated. Unfortunately, that code is lost to time.\n\nWhat am I going to do with the p-System?\n\nI have a couple of goals I’m hoping to accomplish here over the next few months:\n\nGet Apple Pascal up and running in some kind of emulator on my Mac, so I can experience it again Done, see next blog post Build some tools to transfer files to/from disk images for the emulator These already exist, in various forms, but I really want to make my own, partly for the enjoyment of it, partly to have something simple to do in Rust to build familiarity with the language.\n\nDone, see this post Build a p-machine emulator, in Rust and probably a disassembler/assembler, and the rest of the tool chain\n\nmaybe NOT a Pascal compiler, unless I get ambitious Port the p-machine emulator to something other than the Mac Ideally, something small – like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi Pico\n\nWhy build new tools for such an old system?\n\nPartly because I can, and partly because we’re coming up on the 50th anniversary of the UCSD P-System. Development started around 1974, and UCSD Pascal was first released in 1978. I think it’d be fun to build something new with/for that old system, which was really important to me getting started in my career.\n\nAnd partly because, while there are tools out there, they’re often badly-documented (see link rot lament, below), and they often were built decades ago, at this point, and require compilation with gcc 2.x, for instance. I think it’d be nice to bring back some old system software, using “new” tooling, to hopefully extend the legacy of this system a bit longer.\n\nWhere can you find out more about the p-System?\n\nThere is a lot of information available on the Internet, in but it’s scattered everywhere, and a lot of it is suffering link rot these days. One site I found had tantalizing links to a bunch of books, specifications, and historical documents, 80% of which were 404 NOT FOUND. I’m going to add links to other sites to these blog posts as I run across them.\n\nProbably the best place to start digging is Hans Otten’s web site, Pascal for Small Machines, which in addition to p-System information, has a bunch of historical information about other versions of Pascal on “small computers”, meaning mini- and micro-computers.\n\nI found some very interesting historical information about Apple Pascal and the p-machine at The Digital Antiquarian blog. This is part of a series of articles that goes from Pascal, to the p-System, to Sir-tech software and Wizardry, a roleplaying game for the Apple II which was built with Apple Pascal.\n\nThe Jefferson Computer Museum has a page about the UCSD p-System, and links to several interesting collections of software.\n\nNext up: Running Apple Pascal On A Modern Mac"}

Here’s why", "fullContent": "Update on April 25, 2025: As of yesterday, Microsoft has confirmed the issue and implemented a fix, but that fix won’t actually roll out until “early May” (Beta Channel), “mid May” (Current Channel Preview), or “late May” (Current Channel). If you absolutely can’t wait that long for the update, you can revert to version 2405 of classic Outlook, but you’ll be giving up several important security fixes.\n\nOriginal story from April 16, 2025: If you’re still using Microsoft’s classic Outlook app for your emailing needs, you may have noticed that your computer hardware behaves a bit strangely when using the app—most notably when typing.\n\nEarlier this week, Microsoft issued a warning and confirmed that the classic Outlook app can cause your computer’s CPU usage to skyrocket. Processor usage can spike by 30 to 50 percent when writing an email, and also increase your computer’s power consumption. It’s implied that this is a bug, but the root cause isn’t yet known.\n\nThe company says there isn’t yet a direct solution to the problem, but notes that the issue only affects versions of classic Outlook on the Current Channel, Monthly Enterprise Channel, and Insider channels, after updating to Version 2406 Build 17726.20126 or later.\n\nIf this issue is causing you significant trouble, you can work around it by switching your classic Outlook app to the Semi Annual Channel. Instructions on how to do that can be found in Microsoft’s warning, either using the Office Deployment Tool or a Windows registry change. You can also read ongoing discussion of the issue in this Microsoft forum thread."}

Out of most brands which are household names these days, there are very few that have their fingers in as many pies as Samsung does. Considering that Samsung makes phones, computers, and smart TVs, it shouldn't be surprising that it is deep in the software market. There are a lot of apps to its name.\n\nSpeaking of apps, Samsung has just unveiled a new app for users in the UK, and the Samsung News app is joining the family. While the app has been exclusive to the US for the longest time, it is finally getting released in the UK for the first time ever, providing users in that part of the world the chance to put important news stories in one place.\n\nSamsung News Puts a Diverse Range of News In One Convenient Spot\n\nImage: Samsung\n\nThere's a lot going on in the world at any given time, whether you want to focus on the bad stuff, the good stuff, or both. It can be pretty tough staying current because of that, especially when different publications sometimes cover vastly different stories. That's where news aggregator services can help. They don't write their own articles, but bring other platforms' articles to one convenient location.\n\nYou might have heard of Google News. That's a news aggregator app, and is one of the more common ones you'll see used among Android users. Well, it seems that Samsung doesn't want Google to be the only OEM that has its hand in that pie. The South Korean manufacturer has just announced Samsung News for users in the UK, giving them the chance to get all of the latest updates and news stories in one spot.\n\nSamsung News Has Been Around, but Was US-Exclusive\n\nImage: Samsung Image: Samsung\n\nIf you're reading this from the US, you might be wondering why it seems like I'm painting Samsung News to be some kind of new-fangled invention when you've had it forever. Truly, it is not a brand-new app fresh out of the codebase, but it has never really been available to users outside of the US, and this marks the first time that it is, so it is a bit of a win for those in the UK.\n\nThe App Does a Lot More Than Just Throwing News Stories in Your Face\n\nThe most basic news aggregators simply just scrape the internet for new stories for major publications and give you the chance to click their links. Unsurprisingly, a news aggregator app from Samsung needs to do a lot more than that, and I think that it does.\n\nImage: Samsung\n\nSamsung News presents you with news articles from a bunch of different publications, including Sky News, The Independent, Business Insider, Reuters, Sky Sports, and many more. The best part is that you get to read them for free without bothering about paywalls. You will also be able to get recommended only the topics that you care about, in categories like sports, politics, and business.\n\nSamsung Free, a similar app that comes pre-installed on most Samsung Galaxy smartphones (which was itself replacing Samsung Daily), will now be updated to Samsung News. However, other users can simply go to the Galaxy Store to install it themselves."}

The organization envisions that if it succeeds in reintroducing the birds, they will be “protected under existing wildlife laws,” Bennett says.\n\nEven some genetic engineers involved in the mammoth project, initiated more than decade ago at Harvard University, have mixed opinions on patenting de-extinct animals. Cory Smith, now a biotech executive, was a student when he helped prepare an earlier patent application on engineered elephants, which the school filed in 2021. “I am not sure it should have an owner,” says Smith. “I have always been on the side that maybe the animals shouldn’t be patented.”\n\nDuring its press blitz last week, Colossal was careful not to reveal the exact genetic changes it had made to its wolves, telling advisors it needed to keep them secret for “intellectual-property reasons.” This prevented outside scientists from fully assessing the experiment. But it also would have also allowed Colossal to present the information to the patent office, since information already in the public domain can’t be patented.\n\nIn response to emailed questions, Lamm initially sought to avoid saying whether or not Colossal had filed for a patent covering the transgenic wolves, similar to the one on the “mammoth.” It’s a sensitive question, since such a patent would mean the canids are articles of commerce, not wild creatures returned to their “rightful place in the ecosystem,” as the company said last week.\n\n“We take a thoughtful approach to intellectual property that balances scientific advancement with sustainable business practices,” Lamm said in his initial response. “What’s important to understand is that any IP protection would be limited to specific technical methods and innovations we’ve developed—not the genetic heritage of extinct species themselves. We see ourselves as stewards of this science rather than owners of these magnificent creatures.”\n\nThe pending mammoth patent paints a very different picture. First filed in 2023, it is titled “Woolly mammoth specific gene variants and compositions comprising same” and contains a list of 29 claims that seek to control both a long list of mammoth gene variants and animals whose bodies contain that genetic code."}

Her IQ is very high. She comes from a winning program, and all that stuff translates when you have multiple tools like she does,\" one GM said. \"She could be 1-for-9 from the field but have eight assists. Most people can't flip the switch. When you have multiple skills like she does, it allows you to assimilate faster.\n\n\"She's not Caitlin Clark, she's built differently, but she can make people better, and she's hypercompetitive and she can get to her spots at the same time. And she's going to have even more weapons around her in our league, so her playmaking will be even more on display.\"\n\nBueckers' size (she's listed as 6-foot) and varied skill set should give her positional versatility in the pros: She can play either point guard or shooting guard (or even small forward in some instances) for the Wings, though multiple GMs said that long term, they see Bueckers as more of a point guard who'll thrive as a pick-and-roll ball handler.\n\n\"When you look at what she can do and how she does it and how efficient she is,\" said one GM, \"that, to me, is what makes it where she could be one of the greats that play.\"\n\nIN YEAR 1, Bueckers' role will be determined by first-year head coach Koclanes and his staff as they seek to get the most out of a new-look Wings roster -- one that also boasts one of the WNBA's top scorers in Arike Ogunbowale (20.6 PPG in her career).\n\nWith Ogunbowale also capable of playing both guard positions, Dallas will have flexibility in how it employs its backcourt. Koclanes could opt to keep Bueckers off the ball more as a rookie, since that would reduce the pressure she faces from opposing defenses.\n\n\"I think what makes her special is she can fill the gap, and she can fill whatever gap,\" Koclanes said Monday night. \"We can put her on the ball, we can put her off the ball, and she'll be just as good, just as efficient, just as effective, and, most importantly, just as willing. And I think that speaks to her unselfishness. I'm excited as a coach to be able to talk to her and find out what works. \"\n\nAmong the intangibles that GMs pointed out could translate to the next level: leadership, poise and maturity developed from having to overcome adversity throughout her college career. Never getting too high nor too low, one GM said, should help Bueckers stay the course in her first year especially.\n\nBueckers was sidelined for nearly two years at UConn with knee injuries -- a tibial plateau fracture and meniscus tear in 2021 and an ACL tear in 2022 -- but finished her time in Storrs with two healthy seasons during which she played the best basketball of her career.\n\nPlay Fantasy Women's Basketball Fantasy Women's Basketball is now open! Create or join a league today to get started. • Sign up for free!\n\nMost GMs said her injury history is something to be cognizant of but not overly concerned about. As she rehabbed her ACL injury, Bueckers started working with Susan King Borchardt, a performance enhancement specialist who works with an array of WNBA stars; now Bueckers will have more time than ever to dedicate toward taking care of her body, the GMs pointed out.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" one GM said on whether the injuries are cause for concern. \"Like, who cares how many injuries she's had? She's special.\"\n\nThat wasn't a universal belief, though.\n\n\"My only concern with Paige is physical,\" a different GM said. \"She's pretty slight; she's a little bit knock-kneed. There's a level of physicality you have to get used to playing in the pros that I think could take its toll on her, and then just her physical ability to hold up over the years. You've seen the injuries at Connecticut.\"\n\nAnother GM added: \"Her strength is probably an area of opportunity for her, as it is for so many players coming into the league.\"\n\nAcclimating to the physicality of professional basketball is typically one of the biggest learning curves for rookies. That and the game moving too fast were aspects that Clark, for instance, had to get used to last season on her way to earning an All-WNBA first-team selection.\n\nThe GMs said the transition for Bueckers will likely be no different, especially as a No. 1 pick whom opponents are particularly motivated to lock up.\n\n\"I expect the same learning curve as we saw with Clark,\" one GM said. \"Figuring out the pro game, its coverages, dealing with [athletes] bigger, faster, stronger than collegiate players will all be challenges.\""}

The best of the ESPN class of 2025 competed in multiple high-profile settings, including state championships, weekend tournaments and the McDonald's All-American game.\n\nEtiwanda (CA) finished its quest for a threepeat and is the final No. 1 team in the SCNext Top 25 rankings; IMG Academy (FL) won the Chipotle Nationals; and after a lengthy decision process, Aaliyah Chavez committed to Oklahoma.\n\nThe seniors will graduate and the club circuit begins for the juniors and underclassmen, including the U16 USA Basketball trials in May (the selected roster will compete in the FIBA U16 Women's AmeriCup in June).\n\nSo, it's time for one final ranking of the 2025, 2026 and 2027 classes. Here are the biggest movers across the board -- including a new No. 1 senior.\n\nJump to:\n\n2025 risers | 2026 risers | 2027 risers | 2028 standouts\n\nThe No. 1 debate\n\nThis was the closest No. 1 contest in the past five years. Sienna Betts, Aaliyah Chavez and Jasmine Davidson each had a legitimate claim, though Chavez held the top spot all season. Here is the final analysis on each player, and how they finish their prep careers.\n\nNo. 1 Jasmine Davidson\n\nPrevious ranking: 3 | 6-1 | guard | Clackamas (OR) | Committed to USC\n\nDavidson, who debuted as the No. 1 freshman, spent much of her senior year at No. 3 before ending the year at the top. She led Clackamas (OR) to the 6A OSAA championship game but fell short of winning the title.\n\nWhat makes her stand out: Davidson is the most complete player in this class. A floor general who makes others better, she is comfortable in the lead guard spot and taking over the scoring. She is long and bouncy at 6-1, glides to the rim and elevates gracefully when attacking. She has extensive playmaking experience, and is used to the pressures that come with the role.\n\nDavidson is also a high-assist player who rebounds very well for a guard. She has a high IQ when it comes to cutting and moving without the ball and finding post ups and easy slashing opportunities to score. Defensively, she is used to guarding opponents' best players -- including perimeter players.\n\nJazzy Davidson stuffed the stat sheet in Team USA's victory tonight! #NikeHoopSummit\n\n\n\n17 PTS\n\n6 REB\n\n6 AST\n\n3 STL\n\n3 BLK pic.twitter.com/rDBHVZlGpy — NBA Future Starts Now (@nbafuturenow) April 13, 2025\n\nWhat's the next step? Davidson will need to add strength. She needs to shoot more consistently from beyond the arc (high 30% or above) and via her pull up jumper. Sometimes she can find herself a little deep in the paint when she could have risen up for a 15-footer a few dribbles prior. Davidson can also work on better creating contact for trips to the free throw line.\n\nSienna Betts will take her elite big skills to UCLA to play alongside her sister in the fall. She finishes high school as the No. 2 player in the 2025 class. Soobum Im/Getty Images\n\nNo. 2 Sienna Betts\n\nPrevious ranking: 2 | 6-4 | forward | Grandview (CO) | Committed to UCLA\n\nBetts, the sister of UCLA forward (and former No. 1 recruit in the class of 2022) Lauren Betts, led her high school team to the 6A CHSAA State Championship for a third time. She was also named the Morgan Wootten National Player of the Year.\n\nWhat makes her stand out: Betts is the prototypical new age 5-player, able to compete away from the paint, maneuver ball screens defensively in several different coverages and occasionally switch onto a perimeter player and defend without fouling. Betts uses her tall, broad and strong frame to change shots anywhere within 15 feet of the rim, and carve out massive space for rebounding.\n\nOffensively, she is effective in the traditional back-to-the-basket post-up as well as in the face-up game, and she can put the ball on the floor. Her mid-range game is more than respectable and she has started to trust the 3-ball a bit more regularly. She is also a fundamentally fantastic passer and legitimate triple-double threat.\n\nWhat's the next step? The competition and physicality for a big makes a huge jump in college -- especially a program like UCLA where your 6-7 All-American sister awaits every day in practice. Habits like finishing high or against contact become paramount. It is vital for Betts to limit her dribbles on post touches and trust her right hand more around the rim. She must increase her motor and finish better in traffic and higher off the glass. She will also need to learn how to fight boxouts and attack the offensive glass. Improving the 3-pointer will be a huge asset for the Bruins.\n\nAaliyah Chavez is the best shooter in the 2025 class and ends her prep career ranked at No. 3 Cameron Browne/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nNo. 3 Aaliyah Chavez\n\nPrevious ranking: 1 | 5-foot-11 | point guard | Monterrey (TX) | Committed to Oklahoma\n\nChavez spent the entire senior season in the top spot. Her high school team won the UIL 5A Division 2 State Championship, and she was named the Naismith Player of the Year and for a second time the Gatorade Player of the Year.\n\nWhat makes her stand out: Chavez is the ultimate shot-maker and the best scorer in this class. She has proven time and again that no matter the moment, she wants the ball and wants the shot. She is high-volume, but also solid in making shots, and finishes her prep career with some monumental scoring records.\n\nChavez can score from deep range, the pull up and the free throw line. At times, she is a quality passing playmaker and knows how to create easy opportunities for others. This has to be incorporated more into her game as she transitions to the next level.\n\nWhat's the next step? Chavez had the ball a lot in her hands at the prep level, but is unlikely to see the same frequency in college. She will accordingly need to adjust to a different rhythm as she plays alongside, and faces, better talent. She will also need to trust the flow of the game more and learn to use her gravity to manipulate defenses, even when she doesn't have the ball.\n\nDefensively, Chavez experiences lulls -- she was allowed to rest defensively during games because of the offensive load she carried with both her high school and EYBL teams. She's moderate from an athletic standpoint, which could present a challenge for her. This was evident during the McDonald's All-American event.\n\nNotable jumps in the Class of 2025\n\nEmilee Skinner will attend Duke in 2025-26. Soobum Im/Getty Images\n\nNo. 4 Emilee Skinner\n\nPrevious ranking: 7 | 6-0 | point guard | Ridgeline (UT) | Committed to Duke\n\nSkinner led her high school team to a third consecutive state championship. A smooth point guard, she has improved her ability to create her own shot alongside becoming an excellent finisher. She is also an underrated but fierce defender. Duke is getting an elite point guard in the mold of Sue Bird.\n\nNo. 20 Jaida Civil\n\nPrevious ranking: 32 | 6-0 | guard | Palm Bay Magnet (FL) | Committed to Tennessee\n\nCivil will fit perfectly in Kim Caldwell's Tennessee system. She excels in the open court, with an understated quality as a distributor who can finish at the rim. An improving jumper bodes well for her continued growth.\n\nNo. 21 Alexandra Eschmeyer\n\nPrevious ranking: 31 | 6-5 | forward | Peak To Peak Charter School (CO) | Committed to Stanford\n\nOn the younger side in the class, Eschmeyer has gained strength in her long 6-5 frame and jumped up 10 spots into the top-25. She has perimeter skill, a high motor and can sprint the floor hard. She projects as one of the traditional effective Stanford bigs.\n\n2026 ESPN 60 risers\n\nNo. 15 Kaeli Wynn\n\nPrevious ranking: 31 | 6-2 | wing/forward | Mater Dei HS (CA) | Uncommitted\n\nWynn has always played hard, but has recently developed a competitive edge. It has allowed her to use her physicality around the rim for rebounds and post ups and finishing better. She has an advanced handle and IQ for a wing/forward. Both of her parents are coaches, so she's well ahead of other players when it comes to the intangibles.\n\nShe currently has offers from a number of schools, including Stanford, Michigan State, South Carolina and UCLA.\n\nNo. 17 Lilly Williams\n\nPrevious ranking: 20 | 6-5 | center | Home School (MI) | Committed to Michigan State\n\nA major physical presence from baseline to baseline, Williams has taken huge steps in her development. She can now sprint the floor and battle inside leveraging her long, strong frame.\n\nShe can rise up and dunk and has great hands and feet. As she learns to execute in different defensive scenarios, she will be elite on that end of the floor. She is a fantastic early commitment for Robyn Fralick and Michigan State.\n\nDunk after a W?? 🤷🏼‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/UK3lydq3fR — Lilly Williams (@LillyAWilliams) February 12, 2025\n\nNo. 27 Mimi Thiero\n\nPrevious ranking: 55 | 6-4 | forward | Quaker Valley (PA) | Uncommitted\n\nThiero has an extremely high ceiling and has begun adding advanced coordination to her natural prowess, to score and change the game defensively.\n\nShe is comfortable in the open court handling the ball and has an instinct to play off of two feet around the rim and in traffic. She is on pace for a huge summer, so expect her recruitment to heat up.\n\nShe currently has offers from schools including North Carolina, Harvard, Princeton, Cal, Kansas State, Clemson, Texas A&M, Michigan, Florida, Maryland, Louisville, Illinois and Georgia Tech.\n\n2027 ESPN 25 risers\n\nNo. 25 Saniyah Murray\n\nPrevious ranking: Unranked | 6-4 | forward/center | Harrison Central HS (MS) | Uncommitted\n\nWhat jumps out about Murray immediately is her constant motor. She is tall and long, and out-competes everyone on the floor. She has a nice touch and face-up instinct out of the post areas, with a knack for pursuing -- and securing -- boards.\n\nThis will be a big summer for Murray, who needs to experience elite competition.\n\nHer recruitment currently includes offers from Mississippi State, Clemson, Ole Miss, Jackson State and Charlotte.\n\nNo. 11 Eve Long\n\nPrevious ranking: 16 | 6-3 | forward | Olathe South HS (KS) | Uncommitted\n\nLong's energy initially made up for a lack of experience, and even some skill. But she's now added some major fundamental elements to her game: namely, reliable 3-point shooting and better ball-handling. She has a long, wiry frame with a natural slashing ability, and is crafty finishing around the rim. She needs to now add strength and finish higher around the rim.\n\nHer recruitment includes offers from Arizona, Baylor, Louisville, Michigan, Mississippi State, Oklahoma, Florida, Florida State, Kansas, Kansas State, Oklahoma State, Miami, Ole Miss, Alabama, Cal and North Carolina.\n\nNo. 8 Jemini Mitchell\n\nPrevious ranking: 14 | 6-1 | wing/forward | Cy Springs HS (TX) | Uncommitted\n\nMitchell took on great responsibility for her team's success this high school season, and grew immensely. She's always had a great frame but has now sharpened every aspect of her game. In particular, she has become lethal from the 3, knows how to operate in the post and has the IQ to facilitate.\n\nA smooth operator with an old school wing/forward game, her recruitment includes offers from schools like Texas, LSU and Ole Miss plus many others.\n\nLooking ahead to the class of 2028\n\nTatianna Griffin\n\n6-0 | guard | Ontario Christian (CA)\n\nSydney Douglas\n\n6-5 | center/forward | Ontario Christian (CA)\n\nFew freshmen had a more intense season than Griffin and Douglas did at Ontario Christian, which played 11 top 25 teams. Through the year, both players logged major minutes, produced and showed growth.\n\nGriffin averaged 17.8 points, 8.2 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game. She is a full-time perimeter threat, improving her handle and consistency on her jumper to go along with incredible strength and physicality on both ends.\n\nHer recruitment includes offers from Oregon, Louisville, Maryland, Baylor, LSU, USC, Virginia Tech, SMU, Cal, Florida, Michigan State and North Carolina.\n\nDouglas averaged 14 points, 10 rebounds and 3.7 blocks per game. She increased her motor overall and learned to pursue rebounds outside of her area and play without fouling. She showed she has touch from the outside and is starting to embrace the inevitable physicality she will need to play with her entire career."}

Everywhere you look, personalization is being pushed as the holy grail of UX. AI promises to tailor experiences, predict user behavior, and serve content in a way that feels almost… human.\n\nOr does it?\n\nBecause if we’re being honest, a lot of AI-driven personalization doesn’t feel human at all. It feels robotic, a little creepy, and sometimes downright annoying.\n\nSure, it’s cool when Netflix magically knows you’ll love that obscure sci-fi thriller from 1997. But when an online store bombards you with ads for the toaster you bought last week? That’s just dumb.\n\nAs a web designer, you already know the basics. AI-driven personalization isn’t just about slapping a chatbot on a homepage or tweaking color schemes based on user behavior. The real challenge is making AI work with your design, not against it. And that’s where things get messy.\n\nPersonalization Should Feel Like Magic, Not Manipulation\n\nAt its best, AI-driven personalization creates an experience so seamless that users barely notice it’s happening. Think about Amazon. Their recommendation engine doesn’t just suggest random junk—it learns, refines, and serves up products that make actual sense based on a user’s behavior. Spotify and Netflix do it too, subtly adapting playlists and content queues without making it feel forced.\n\nThat’s the kind of personalization that works. It enhances the experience without getting in the way. It doesn’t break UX conventions or throw users into unfamiliar territory. It’s effortless, invisible, and—most importantly—it feels natural.\n\nBut when personalization is done badly, it turns the web into a dystopian nightmare.\n\nEver landed on a website that remembers way too much about you? One minute, you’re casually browsing, and the next, the site is aggressively recommending things you barely recall looking at. Instead of guiding users, bad AI-driven design creates a filter bubble, limiting choices instead of expanding them.\n\nAnd that’s the real danger: personalization can either enhance discovery or completely kill it.\n\nThe Over-Personalization Problem\n\nThe moment personalization starts feeling intrusive, it backfires.\n\nPicture this: you visit a news site a few times, reading a mix of political articles. The AI behind the site decides, “Ah, you must only want content that aligns with these past clicks!” Suddenly, every time you visit, you see the same type of stories, the same perspectives, and the same echo chamber reinforcing itself.\n\nThis is exactly what happens with over-personalized AI in web design. It assumes too much. It stops suggesting fresh content, stops surprising users, and turns the experience into a predictable, repetitive loop.\n\nAnd predictability? That’s UX poison.\n\nUsers don’t always want a tailored experience. Sometimes they just want to explore, to discover, to stumble upon something unexpected. But when AI over-personalizes, it removes that possibility. Instead of helping, it limits.\n\nHow To Personalize Without Ruining UX\n\nSo how do you keep AI-driven personalization from turning your site into an over-optimized mess?\n\nFirst, don’t let AI control the entire experience. Keep core UI elements consistent. A website shouldn’t feel completely different just because a user visited a few times. Imagine if every time you opened Netflix, the homepage had a totally new layout based on what you watched last. That would be chaos. Instead, Netflix keeps the interface the same but tweaks content placement. That’s the balance you want—adaptive, but predictable.\n\nSecond, give users control over personalization. Instead of AI making all the decisions, let users opt into personalized recommendations. A simple “Show me more like this” button can make all the difference between helpful and intrusive. Let users choose how much AI-driven adaptation they want.\n\nAnd third, don’t make AI creepy. We’ve all seen those websites that seem to know way too much about us. There’s a fine line between a website being smart and feeling like it’s watching your every move. If AI-generated messages start sounding like they’re tracking exact user behavior—”Hey, we noticed you hovered over this button for 5 seconds!”—you’ve gone too far.\n\nWhere AI Personalization Is Headed\n\nThe scary part? This is just the beginning. AI isn’t just going to recommend content or products. In the future, websites will dynamically change based on how you move your mouse, how fast you scroll, even what mood your face shows while looking at the screen.\n\nIt sounds amazing—and terrifying.\n\nIf done right, AI-driven personalization could create an internet where every user journey is uniquely optimized for engagement. If done wrong, it could lead to a soulless, hyper-personalized web that eliminates spontaneity and creativity.\n\nAs a designer, your job isn’t to just “implement AI.” It’s to design experiences that feel human, even when powered by machines. The goal isn’t just to personalize—it’s to create an experience that’s actually better because of it.\n\nSo, are we building a web that truly understands users—or just one that traps them in an endless loop of their past behavior? Let’s talk. Where do you stand on AI-driven personalization. Is it the future of UX, or are we automating our way into a design disaster?"}

I can’t find specific warranty info on this model, but Dell Refurbished says it covers all equipment with a 100-day policy, which is pretty standard.

Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Reddit users recently discovered that some Galaxy AI features are only available in China.\n\nThis includes Social Composer, Ask AI, Touch Assistant, and Samsung Assistant.\n\nOf these four features, Social Composer is the only one I’d rather not see in more regions, as it would worsen the quality of social media platforms.\n\nGenerative AI features are generating a lot of excitement right now, and Samsung has perhaps the best selection of AI-powered features on mobile devices. The availability of Galaxy AI features differs by region, though. It turns out that Chinese users have access to some AI features that even U.S. users don’t have. One of those features is called Social Composer, and based on its description, I think the rest of the world is better off without it.\n\nWith the increase in AI writing tools, more people are using them to write posts online. Some people use them to help correct simple grammar or spelling mistakes, while others use them to generate entire articles to save time. Using AI to correct issues with text you’ve written yourself is fine—I do it all the time—but relying on it to create text can be problematic. The resulting text often reads inauthentically, which is especially concerning when shared on social media platforms designed for real people to share their thoughts.\n\nThat’s why I’m glad that Samsung’s Social Composer feature isn’t available globally. The feature uses AI to generate social media posts based on your images. I don’t think it would perform well, though. I haven’t actually used Social Composer myself since it’s only available in China, but I suspect it would generate social media posts that are bland, cringeworthy, or nonsensical. Given how other AI-powered attempts at social media creation are going, it’s unlikely Social Composer would be any better.\n\nSocial Composer isn’t the only China-exclusive Galaxy AI feature Though I’m happy that Social Composer isn’t available globally, I’m a bit frustrated that Samsung chose to exclude the rest of the world from some other Galaxy AI features. Samsung Assistant, for example, seems like it would be incredibly useful. It contains a number of helpful tools, most notably a “clipboard assistant” feature that scans the clipboard to provide recommended actions in a panel. These actions let you quickly correct, summarize, translate, favorite, search, or open text that you’ve copied. The clipboard overlay found in the standard version of Android supports some of these actions, but the overlay is notably absent from One UI 7.\n\nSamsung Assistant also includes an “app return assistant” feature that provides a floating menu to quickly return to select apps (takeout, taxi, maps, navigation, and more), a “feature suggestion assistant” that offers recommendations on features to help you use your phone more efficiently, a “rewards assistant” that gives you information about rewards benefits when you use certain apps, and a “recording assistant” that adds a floating button to record calls in supported apps. The “rewards assistant” might not be applicable to many apps outside of China, but I can see the rest having some use in global markets.\n\nThe other two Galaxy AI features exclusive to China are Ask AI and Touch Assistant. Ask AI lets you ask questions to an AI chatbot, which generates a response based on its knowledge and information from the web. Since Gemini, Google’s AI model, is available on Galaxy phones outside of China, I can understand why Samsung didn’t bring Ask AI to global versions of One UI 7. Touch Assistant, meanwhile, processes text on screen to “improve your reading efficiency.” It’s similar to Circle to Search, so it makes sense why it’s not available outside of China.\n\nGalaxy AI is the most comprehensive suite of generative AI tools on mobile devices, and it’s even better equipped in China. Given the limited availability of Google services in China, it makes sense why some features are only available in that market. Some features, like Samsung Assistant and Social Composer, could be rolled out globally, though. I’d like to see Samsung Assistant make its way to global markets, but I’m content with Social Composer staying right where it is.\n\nThanks to Reddit user FragmentedChicken for sharing screenshots and screen recordings of these China-exclusive Galaxy AI features!\n\nGot a tip?

Comcast has been a fairly constant source of that particular anxiety, especially for its Xfinity broadband service in the US. But now it’s promising that it won’t raise rates for 5 years… if you jump through a few hoops.\n\nDigital Trends reports that there’s a lot of fine details in the fine print of the announcement. First, you have to be a new customer—if you’ve been using Xfinity for years, you’re apparently unworthy of this consideration. New users don’t have to sign a contract, and they’re able to get the price lock without a commitment. But home internet plans that qualify for the 5-year lock start at $55 per month, versus $40 per month if you do sign a contract for just one year. For the cheaper plan, there’s no guarantee about the price beyond that. Oh, and the offer is only good until June 23rd, according to the promotional site.\n\nUpdate: A Comcast representative reached out to me and said that the company intends to make the offer available to current customers “later this month,” and that though the current terms say the opportunity expires in June, they “intend to extend this beyond that date.” Nice.\n\nSo yeah, that’s a bit of a dice roll if you’re trying to save money on these less-expensive options. (For international readers: Yes, $40-55 per month is pretty cheap in the US, especially in metro areas.) If you’re fairly certain that you’ll be sticking with Comcast for the long haul—or you have no other choice, since much of the country operates with effective monopolies on wired internet service—then signing up at the $55 rate might make sense. You’ll have the option to drop it in a heartbeat if you see a better deal, say, on 5G-based service from Verizon or T-Mobile.\n\nBut if you don’t think you’ll be in the same area for that long, or if you’re pretty sure you’ll be switching away between 1 and 5 years from now, then the cheaper contract option probably makes more sense.\n\nWith my deepest apologies, I might suggest you break out the calculator if you’re on the fence. And if you’re planning on holding an internet service provider to any commitment that it makes about prices staying low… well, maybe set your expectations low, too."}

Atomic Keyboard decided to combine these inspirations when it made the MDR Dasher, a revival of a classic design from the Data General Corporation in the 1970s.\n\nThe Data General’s Dasher terminal series is iconic, with many classic keyboard fans loving its chunky blue keys and huge layout in particular. The Lumon employee cubicle setups in Severance are heavily inspired by—possibly even salvaged from—terminals like the Dasher 6053 from 1977, though they have an altered layout and a trackball mouse area. As DesignBoom notes, the keyboards seen on the show have no Escape, no Control, and no Option keys. It is a dystopia, after all.\n\nAtomic Keyboard\n\nAtomic Keyboard’s recreation of the massive design element keeps the blue and beige hues and the big black optical trackball on the right side, with two oversized mouse keys. The current design features a 73-key layout in a unique 70% design, an aluminum case, and a USB-C connection, in case you actually want to use it on something manufactured in this century. It’s in pre-production now.\n\nWhen will you be able to buy one? Who knows. Atomic Keyboard is accepting email signups and has a preliminary price of $400, which isn’t unreasonable in the space of big, custom, small-batch keyboard designs. But with the chaos surrounding international trade at the moment, who knows how much it’ll cost when it’s finally ready to head out to buyers?\n\nAtomic Keyboard\n\nRetro tech is all the rage now, as seen in Severance and the computers from Marvel’s Time Variance Authority in Loki. It’s a retro-futurist style that the Fallout games have been playing with for decades, and some observers are calling it “Cassette Futurism.” You can even see it in the trailer for Naughty Dog’s new game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, with a bounty hunter’s Porsche spaceship filled with a CD-based jukebox, chunky keyboards, printers, and CRT screens that look like they fell off the original Alien set."}

(1:38)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nWhen we debuted the first edition of our Way-Too-Early Top 25 on the final Monday night of the 2024-25 college basketball season, Texas Tech barely had enough players to fill out a projected starting lineup and BYU didn't have a point guard on its roster, earning each a spot in the back half of the rankings.\n\nTen days later, both Big 12 teams have an argument as a potential national championship contender.\n\nTexas Tech sees the biggest rise from version 1.0 to 2.0, jumping 19 spots in the rankings to leave only Houston and Purdue ahead of the Red Raiders. JT Toppin's decision to forgo the NBA draft and return to Lubbock was the biggest reason for the leap, as he gives Grant McCasland a legitimate preseason first-team All-American. But Tech also hit the transfer portal to add potential starters LeJuan Watts (Washington State), Donovan Atwell (UNC Greensboro) and Tyeree Bryan (Santa Clara).\n\nMeanwhile, BYU moved up 10 spots after adding Baylor transfer Robert Wright III at the point guard position. Wright was one of the best freshmen in the country this past season, showing incredible dynamism with the ball in his hands. Surrounding him with A.J. Dybantsa and Richie Saunders will cause nightmares for opponents.\n\nThat's how quickly things can change at this point in the offseason -- and with less than one week until the transfer portal closes, the roster additions will only increase, so we'll roll out version 3.0 shortly after the April 22 deadline. But for now, here's the latest forecast of the top 25 teams for the 2025-26 season.\n\nPrevious ranking: 1\n\nMilos Uzan declared for the NBA draft earlier this week, but we might not know his final decision until the deadline. Kelvin Sampson has already recruited an experienced guard to help replace Uzan, landing Creighton transfer Pop Isaacs, a scorer who can create opportunities for others.\n\nThe Cougars are also bringing in one of the elite recruiting classes in the country, with three top-20 prospects in the fold. Combined with the return of Emanuel Sharp and Joseph Tugler, we've got faith in Houston.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nKingston Flemings (No. 20 in ESPN 100)\n\nPop Isaacs (16.3 PPG at Creighton)\n\nEmanuel Sharp (12.7 PPG)\n\nJoseph Tugler (5.5 PPG)\n\nChris Cenac Jr. (No. 6 in ESPN 100)\n\nPrevious ranking: 2\n\nThere's a chance Purdue has the preseason Wooden Award favorite and two All-Americans on its roster in 2025-26. Braden Smith will start the season as the best guard in the country after taking the next step in his development this past campaign, while Trey Kaufman-Renn is a dominant force in the paint. The addition of South Dakota State transfer Oscar Cluff should help inside, while a healthy Daniel Jacobsen could be poised for a breakout season. Matt Painter could still add depth from the portal.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nBraden Smith (15.8 PPG)\n\nC.J. Cox (6.0 PPG)\n\nFletcher Loyer (13.8 PPG)\n\nTrey Kaufman-Renn (20.1 PPG)\n\nOscar Cluff (17.6 PPG at South Dakota State)\n\nPrevious ranking: 22\n\nAs mentioned above, McCasland's team had the biggest rise since the first iteration of the rankings on championship Monday. The biggest move was the return of JT Toppin, the surefire preseason All-American who dominated the second half of this past season. But the addition of LeJuan Watts, a versatile and skilled wing forward, ensures a seamless replacement for Darrion Williams if he opts to remain in the portal or NBA draft. Christian Anderson should also take a step forward in his sophomore season.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nChristian Anderson (10.6 PPG)\n\nDonovan Atwell (13.3 PPG at UNC Greensboro)\n\nTyeree Bryan (10.4 PPG at Santa Clara)\n\nLeJuan Watts (13.7 PPG at Washington State)\n\nJT Toppin (18.2 PPG)\n\nPrevious ranking: 3\n\nPat Kelsey has had as strong of an offseason as any coach in the country through the past couple of weeks, landing impact transfers Ryan Conwell (Xavier), Isaac McKneely (Virginia) and Adrian Wooley (Kennesaw State) to go with top-10 recruit Mikel Brown Jr. in next season's backcourt.\n\nThere are questions up front, though, as we await an announcement from Kasean Pryor. But J'Vonne Hadley is back while James Scott and Aly Khalifa are options up front if Pryor leaves. Germany native Sananda Fru will also factor into the rotation.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nMikel Brown Jr. (No. 8 in ESPN 100)\n\nIsaac McKneely (14.4 PPG at Virginia)\n\nRyan Conwell (16.5 PPG at Xavier)\n\nJ'Vonne Hadley (12.2 PPG)\n\nKasean Pryor (12.0 PPG in seven games)\n\nPrevious ranking: 4\n\nUConn's national championship streak ended at two -- now Dan Hurley and the Huskies will look to reload to make another run. Solo Ball is likely to receive legitimate preseason All-America buzz, while Silas Demary Jr. is more similar of a player to what the Huskies had in Tristen Newton a couple seasons ago. Braylon Mullins should be one of the more impactful newcomers in the country, and Tarris Reed Jr. is a double-double threat. Dayton transfer Malachi Smith adds point guard depth. What will Alex Karaban do?\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nSilas Demary Jr. (13.5 PPG at Georgia)\n\nSolo Ball (14.4 PPG)\n\nBraylon Mullins (No. 14 in ESPN 100)\n\nJaylin Stewart (5.4 PPG)\n\nTarris Reed Jr. (9.6 PPG)\n\nPrevious ranking: 16\n\nAll eyes will be on Provo, Utah, next season, as No. 1 recruit A.J. Dybantsa arrives at the collegiate level to suit up for the Cougars. How will Kevin Young build around Dybantsa? Teaming him up on the wing with high-level scorer Richie Saunders is a great start. The Cougars also landed Baylor transfer Robert Wright III at point guard. That trio should be one of the country's most explosive on the offensive end.\n\nThe key will be BYU improving defensively.

The early part of the month saw a handful of extensions as talks that had begun in Spring Training carried into the regular season. There probably won't be much more significant hot stove activity for the next couple months. That's largely because all but three teams -- the White Sox, Marlins and Rockies -- went into the season with some measure of hope about competing. The trio of clearly noncompetitive clubs had already moved most of their realistic trade candidates who'd bring back prospect talent.\n\nLuis Robert Jr. is an exception. The White Sox held onto their former All-Star center fielder over the offseason. Robert was coming off the worst season of his career. He lost nearly two months early in the season with a hip flexor strain and was unproductive when healthy. He hit .224/.278/.379 with 14 homers in 100 games. Robert looked nothing like the player who'd finished 12th in AL MVP balloting one year earlier.\n\nIt made for a difficult evaluation. Robert has shown star upside -- not only in the aforementioned 2023 campaign but in an injury-shortened '21 season when he hit .338/.378/.567 over 68 games. Last year's White Sox were en route to the worst season in the modern era. Maybe Robert's .216/.253/.302 showing in the second half reflected some amount of mental fatigue. At 27 years old, he should remain in his prime."}

Barring an injury to a third baseman on a contender, is he going to be playing for the Cardinals for the next 3 years?\n\nArenado, 34 today, has an excellent 136 wRC+ through 74 plate appearances. His Statcast numbers have always been middling since he was traded to St. Louis four years ago. As you know, the Cardinals tried to move Arenado during the offseason, both to save money and open up playing time for younger players. Arenado wasn't willing to say yes when asked to approve a trade to the Astros in December, and no deal materialized with the four other teams on the third baseman's list.\n\nIn February, Katie Woo of The Athletic reported that the Cardinals \"had conversations with at least nine organizations\" about Arenado during the offseason. Woo said the other four teams on Arenado's list besides the Astros were the Dodgers, Red Sox, Padres, and Yankees. The rigidity of Arenado's list is confusing. He said, \"I don’t see myself changing that list ever. I have a family now. … To be willing to pick up my family and move them, it has to be something that’s worth it.\" Arenado is clearly not bound entirely by geography, having chosen teams on both the East and West coast. But let's look at some playoff odds from when the season opened:\n\nAstros: 53.5%\n\nDodgers: 97.6%\n\nRed Sox: 56.2%\n\nPadres: 35.1%\n\nYankees: 62.3%\n\nCardinals: 23.2%\n\nTigers: 46.6%\n\nRoyals: 41.8%\n\nAngels: 10.5%\n\nIs it fair to say that for Arenado to leave the comfort of St. Louis he needs what he considers a strong chance at winning the World Series, but he might accept a lesser chance for a team near where he grew up, such as the Padres? What makes this tricky is that Arenado seems to have developed his own playoff odds. Playoff odds are not reliable in the best case, and Arenado is probably worse at this than FanGraphs."}

If you have an Intel Core PC with an Nvidia discrete GPU, that’s fine — download the latest Amuse 3.0 version and try its range of capabilities for yourself.\n\nAmuse debuted in 2024 as a collaboration between AMD and TensorStack. In a way, Amuse is AMD’s answer to Intel’s AI Playground, which combines AI art generation with video and integrated LLM chatbots (though video creation didn’t work on AI Playground when I tried it recently). Amuse currently lacks LLM capability, though it can access a number of AI art models — including models explicitly optimized for AMD processors. TensorStack has also added new features: photo filters, local video creation, and AI-powered video generation and restyling, too.\n\nBoth Amuse and AI Playground provide an alternative to cloud-based services like Midjourney, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and others which can generate AI art using a powerful server. Amuse runs locally on your PC, which means that you have the privacy to create whatever you want. Amuse does ship with a terms of service that prevents you from making NSFW art, however, as well as some other provisions. Many people dislike AI art, but you’re free to use Amuse to simply see what artificial intelligence can produce.\n\nPrompt: A computer chip dressed as a superhero, flying over the ocean. Foundry\n\nThe advantage for Amuse, however, is that it doesn’t require an AMD Ryzen processor to run it, although AMD does recommend its own hardware. Amuse is designed to work with standalone AMD discrete GPUs like the Radeon 9700 series, but also Ryzen AI 300 notebooks and especially notebooks with AI powerhouse the Ryzen AI Max and its gobs of video RAM. If you own one, Amuse should be one of your first stops in seeking out AI art.\n\nAI art simply works best with more VRAM, and inside Amuse 3.0 you’ll find several AI generation models designed specifically for AMD’s RDNA and XDNA GPUs and NPUs. Specifically, AMD is saying that AMD optimized models can generate images up to 4.3 times faster at FP16 precision on the Radeon 9700 XT, and up to 3.3 times faster on Ryzen AI processors.\n\nAmuse’s performance varies dramatically\n\nAMD recommends that you own either a PC with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (64GB of RAM), a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 with 32 GB of RAM, or a PC with either a RX 7900 XTX, 7900 XT, 7900 GRE, or 7800 XT GPU. Those aren’t hard-and-fast limits; I tried out the build on two Ryzen AI 365 PCs, one with 32GB of RAM, and one with 24GB of RAM. (I had previously handed over our Asus ROG Flow Z13 (2025) gaming tablet review unit with a Ryzen AI Max+ processor to our video team.)\n\nBoth ran, though more RAM translated into higher performance. That’s because you’ll have to manually adjust the available VRAM via AMD’s Adrenalin software or the PC’s BIOS to max out the available VRAM. (Dedicated GPUs don’t have this option.)\n\nAI art generated on a laptop with a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 with 32GB of RAM. It still took over four minutes. You’ll really need a discrete GPU of some sort, unless you run it on a model that allows it to be generated by the NPU. Foundry\n\nMeasuring performance on an AI art application depends on capable hardware. However, the model itself makes a difference; less sophisticated models execute faster, but generate poorer-quality images. At AMD’s recommendation, I tested out how fast a prompt on Stable Diffusion was, using both the standard model as well as the AMD-optimized version, and the same prompt. The performance improved dramatically; it took Amuse 3.0 and my Ryzen AI 365/32GB laptop 685 seconds (11.42 minutes) to generate just one picture. Using the Ryzen-optimized model, it required just 270 seconds, or 4.5 minutes, meaning that AMD’s estimates weren’t that far off.\n\nThat’s still pretty lousy, though. Simply using the default StableDiffusion XL Turbo model, optimized for the Ryzen AI NPU, pumped out four little cartoon raccoons in 37 seconds, and they didn’t look half bad. The model really matters.\n\nEasy, but sophisticated too\n\nAs anyone who has used Photoshop or the open-source GNU Image Manipulation Program knows, the power of the application is not just what it can do but how easy it is to use.\n\nCrafting AI art isn’t just coming up with the right description. It requires a good, sophisticated model that can generate realistic images, powerful hardware that can generate art without waiting too long, and a user interface that allows you to get started quickly but also offers more sophisticated adjustments to those who seek it. I liked AI Playground’s simplicity. But Amuse begins in what it calls “EZ Mode,” with just a few options: image generation, image or video filtering, and the ability to “design” art based upon your drawings. The latter is basically Windows’ own Cocreator application.\n\nOn a Ryzen machine, Amuse’s EZ-Mode does two things: uses the NPU as an image-generation tool, and then upscales the result. It all saves time and resources, though the guitar in the highlighted image is obviously wrong. Foundry\n\nLike AI Playground, everything is set up to be as simple as possible; if Amuse needs to download something, it will simply explain why, tell you how much space it will consume, then ask for your permission.\n\nA small button down in the lower left-hand corner advertises “expert mode,” which unlocks more advanced features. Here, you can download more of the AMD-optimized models that AMD makes available. (They’re handily labeled with AMD logos.) You can also select multiple models for image or video generation.\n\nThe Expert model allows you to move back and forth between these models for image generation. (You’ll have to manually load in each one, like swapping out a DVD in the player.) The search could be improved, however, as it’s not immediately obvious which models need to be downloaded for use with video generation.\n\nAmuse generates images, which can be saved, edited, or upscaled, or used as the genesis for AI-generated video, too. Unlike some tools, like Adobe Firefly, Amuse does not label the images as AI-generated.\n\nAi text-to-video within Amuse. Note that there are additional options, such as image-to-video and upscaling, too. Foundry\n\nI honestly was not impressed with many of the AI images that the models generated, whether I used the “standard” Stable Diffusion models or the versions optimized for AI. There’s a lot Amuse offers to allow you to tweak the output, however, and it’s worth playing with it to see what works for you.\n\nI liked Amuse’s text-to-video capabilities, however. At least on the models I selected, the default resolution was just 512×512, with just enough keyframes to produce a few seconds of video. I didn’t want to destroy my laptop, so I opted not to push it to its limits (with “HD” video of 1024×1024 as well as several minutes of length.).\n\nBut the imagery was largely coherent, and delivered what I asked for, generally — unless I pushed it above 10 seconds or so. Then it was clear that the generated art had been fashioned from several clips, and not always of the same thing. Some of the competing cloud-based models, such as Sora, or Google’s Veo, look more cohesive.\n\nAI art of a figure skater at sunset, generated by the Locomotion Dreamshaper model within Amuse. Foundry\n\nIs Amuse good? Yeah, and for everyone\n\nCompared to Amuse, Intel’s AI Playground feels a bit more simplistic, a bit more limited, but also a bit more welcoming. It’s a good tool for seeing what AI has to offer, though it’s limited to a subset of Intel processors. The Amuse app is definitely more for enthusiasts, but the user interface doesn’t feel especially overwhelming. Just keep in mind that the app may offer capabilities that go beyond what you want to do with it, such as feature extraction.\n\nAmuse isn’t perfect; I’d like it’s “EZ Mode” to offer a bit more direction into more advanced features, without the need to seek out the “Expert Mode” to the lower right. Likewise, I’d like to see a few more tooltips or assistance into understanding what some of the more advanced features can do. But Amuse is free, installs quickly, and allows you access to specialized models for AMD Ryzen processors without limiting you to them.\n\nEven better, you don’t need to be a Ryzen owner to use it. That elevates Amuse into one of the better AI art app suites, period."}

For my first set of tests, I am using a pair of articles I created, filled with very bad advice. The advice is the same for both articles, but what differs is the intro and the conclusion. One says the advice is good, the other said it is bad. It is all very very bad, including a really terrible SELECT statement versus loop construct that will cause an eternal loop that inserts into a temporary table.\n\nMy goal is to see how much of that advice will be noted as bad, and if it says anything nice at all about the text, etc. If you want to see the entire documents, you can get them here in a zip file, both in text and word document formats.\n\nIf you are questioning this concept of using very poorly written source material, that is understandable. After I finished this article’s first pass, I realized that if I was going to really do a good job testing these models, I am going to need to test with more subtle incorrectness mixed in with correct statements. However, I feel as if there is something to learn from this first experiments which are chronicled here in part 2 and will be with part 3 as well, before I change gears.\n\nBefore I get started, I asked ChatGPT “what model of ChatGPT am I using now?” just to show you where it is at. The reply was:\n\n“You’re currently using ChatGPT-4 with additional features enabled, such as code execution, web browsing, and a document editor for enhanced interactivity and productivity.”\n\nSo whatever that meant on February 1, 2025, it is what it is.“You’re currently using ChatGPT-4 with additional features enabled, such as code execution, web browsing, and a document editor for enhanced interactivity and productivity.”\n\nGetting started with ChatGPT\n\nOkay, I have not used ChatGPT on this document yet at all. I do not have a paid account, so I will be using the free version, with a login. I will try two tests. First, the entire documents will be reviewed and I will give the highlights. Then I will take a section and dig into whatever feedback it gives me.\n\nThe phrase I have found works with Copilot quite well to get it to only give me technology issues has been: “Please review the following document in terms of technology”. So I will be using this as my starting point, though I may change it up a little here and there along the way.\n\nDisclosure: as I originally typed this introduction, I had not used ChatGPT for any work with this document at all, nor had I used Copilot. I just created the documents and edited them with Grammarly.\n\nDocument advocating for the advice\n\nSo here we go. I typed:\n\n“Please review the following document in terms of technology”\n\nAnd then pasted the document with the header that said this was good advice. The result, was oddly polite, but correct. It starts out:\n\n“This document contains several practices and recommendations for SQL Server administrators. However, many of them reflect misconceptions, outdated practices, or outright harmful advice in the realm of modern SQL Server administration. Below is a review of each suggestion from a technical standpoint.”\n\nI liked that it didn’t put any positive or negative in the first sentence. It just said “it contains some stuff.” Kind of like a person might when trying to say ANYTHING positive about an article that is such garbage.\n\nIt ends with:\n\n“While some advice here might be well-intentioned, much of it is outdated, misleading, or counterproductive in modern SQL Server environments. Following these suggestions could lead to security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and operational inefficiencies.”\n\nWell-intentioned. It is almost like it’s trying to be too kind here. It goes on to offer to rewrite the document for me. I was not expecting this, but that will be my next thing to try. I saved the full text of the results here: results if you wish to review.\n\nThe main thing is I am not getting any deeper information. For example, one section in my document contains the following incomprehensibly wrong content:\n\n“- SQL Server works better with LOOPING code If you want to filter from a set of data, the best way is to use a WHILE WEND construct and do the filtering ROW BY ROW. For example, say you have a table with a million rows. You can write: SELECT *\n\nFROM TableName\n\nWHERE Criteria = False; But it is often far faster to use a loop such as: CREATE TEMP TABLE #Results\n\nWHILE (RowsStillInTable)\n\nBEGIN\n\nINSERT INTO #Results\n\nSELECT TOP 1 *\n\nFROM TableName\n\nWHERE Criteria = False;\n\n\n\nIF @@RowsCount = 0\n\nBreak;\n\nWEND; By using the TOP 1 modifier, this allows each iteration to execute much faster than the SELECT statement that needs to touch every row in the table simultaneously.”\n\n“SQL Server Works Better with Looping Code Review: Iterative row-by-row processing (RBAR—”Row By Agonizing Row”) is inefficient. Set-based operations are the foundation of SQL and are far more performant. Recommendation: Use set-based SQL queries and avoid looping constructs whenever possible.”\n\nAnd the reply says:\n\n“SQL Server Works Better with Looping Code Review: Iterative row-by-row processing (RBAR—”Row By Agonizing Row”) is inefficient. Set-based operations are the foundation of SQL and are far more performant. Recommendation: Use set-based SQL queries and avoid looping constructs whenever possible.”\n\nReading over that advice, you should see the code itself is completely wrong. After I let it do a rewrite, I am going to ask it to tell me more about what is wrong in that section.\n\nLet’s see if it can rewrite this for me?\n\nNext, I say yes to letting it rewrite the article for me. You can easily tell that the output it is AI generated, if for no other reason than the overuse of bullet points. The tips come out in a very basic manner, but the tips are generally ok. The document is basically lifeless and example-less, but correct. The replacement for my terrible example code that had code:\n\n“12. Avoid Row-by-Row Processing Row-by-row processing (RBAR) is inefficient. SQL Server is optimized for set-based operations. To enhance performance: Use set-based queries whenever possible.\n\nRewrite RBAR logic into efficient set-based T-SQL statements.”\n\nRBAR? I don’t love that term to start with, but it does not stand for Row-by-row processing, it stands for Row By Agonizing Row. I don’t love it because sometimes you do need to loop. And it makes it sound too much like a human doing work. (Or maybe because I didn’t come up with it, who knows.\n\nThe biggest issue is that it didn’t even try to understand my code, or anything of the sort. It simply gave a bit of advice.\n\nThe complete rewrite results can be found here.\n\nDigging into the advice\n\nFinally, I asked it:\n\n“Give me advice on this section alone:”\n\nAnd pasted in the section 12 as it was shown earlier, with all the really terrible code. The reply:\n\n“Issues with the Given Advice Inefficiency of Row-by-Row Processing:\n\nUsing a loop to process rows one at a time introduces significant overhead.\n\nEach iteration involves separate queries, context switches, and transactions, which degrade performance. Misconception About SELECT Efficiency: A SELECT query with proper indexing can filter data efficiently without requiring loops.\n\nThe suggestion to use TOP 1 in a loop does not improve performance for large datasets; it just splits the work inefficiently. Unnecessary Complexity: The loop adds complexity to the code and increases the likelihood of bugs.\n\nTemporary tables like #Results are not needed for filtering data in this scenario. Correct Approach: Use Set-Based Queries SQL Server is built to handle set-based operations efficiently. To filter data based on a condition, use a single SELECT statement with appropriate indexing: SELECT *\n\nFROM TableName\n\nWHERE Criteria = 0; — Assuming Criteria is a binary or Boolean column Optimizations for Large Datasets If performance is a concern for large datasets, consider these optimizations: Indexing: Ensure there is an index on the Criteria column to speed up filtering. Partitioning: Partition large tables to distribute data and improve query performance. Query Hints: Use query hints like OPTION(RECOMPILE) if parameter sniffing is an issue. Batch Processing: If you need to process the data incrementally, use batch processing instead of row-by-row loops: WHILE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM TableName WHERE Criteria = 0)\n\nBEGIN\n\nDELETE TOP (1000)\n\nFROM TableName\n\nWHERE Criteria = 0;\n\nEND; Summary Avoid loops for filtering data in SQL Server; use set-based queries instead.\n\nOptimize performance with indexing, partitioning, and batch processing if necessary.\n\nRow-by-row processing should be a last resort for edge cases where set-based logic cannot be applied. This approach aligns with SQL Server’s strengths and ensures better performance, simplicity, and maintainability.”\n\nOk, so it is clearly better than my advice, but really, it ignored the meat of my poor code. The advice is more or less correct (some assumptions like Criteria is a bit or integer value), but also subtly different than other advice it had given me, which is always a concern because why would it give different advice for the same input?\n\nFor example, it goes on to talk about deletes for some reason, when I was only talking about a SELECT statement.\n\nExplaining my cruddy code\n\nLast thing I will try is to just ask it to explain my terrible code. So I put in the following prompt:\n\n“Explain this code:\n\nCREATE TEMP TABLE #Results\n\n\n\nWHILE (RowsStillInTable)\n\nBEGIN\n\nINSERT INTO #Results\n\nSELECT TOP 1 *\n\nFROM TableName\n\nWHERE Criteria = False; IF @@RowsCount = 0\n\nBreak;\n\n\n\nWEND; “\n\nThis gave quite a reply. Let’s look at the replies:\n\n“Creating a Temporary Table CREATE TEMP TABLE #Results This line attempts to create a temporary table named #Results. However, there is a syntax error here: In SQL Server, the correct syntax is CREATE TABLE #Results, not CREATE TEMP TABLE. Temporary tables (prefixed with #) exist only for the duration of the session or batch in which they are created. They are often used to store intermediate results.”\n\nYep, guilty! However, I am also guilty of not providing columns or returning the results in the loop, which it failed to note. One thing I am starting to note is that it doesn’t seem to really dig into multiple facets of incorrectness, but if it gives one that is really great.\n\nContinuing into the reply:\n\n“The WHILE Loop WHILE (RowsStillInTable)\n\nBEGIN This is the start of a WHILE loop that is supposed to run as long as the condition (RowsStillInTable) is true. However, RowsStillInTable is not a valid SQL Server construct, and this part of the code is incorrect or incomplete. Typically, the condition would need to be a Boolean expression, such as checking if ows still exist in the source table.”\n\nSomething to notice here. Be careful if you are using this to look at something that includes pseudocode (especially if it isn’t labeled as such. It doesn’t realize that this could be just saying to check for rows in the table. I didn’t enumerate that, so this is good stuff too.\n\nSometimes I find it taking RowsStillInTable as a Boolean value (which SQL Server doesn’t support), or as an integer, but never did it consider that it might just be pseudocode.\n\n“3. Inserting Rows Into the Temporary Table INSERT INTO #Results\n\nSELECT TOP 1 *\n\nFROM TableName\n\nWHERE Criteria = False; This statement inserts a single row (TOP 1) from TableName into the temporary table #Results where the Criteria column has the value False (or 0, depending on data type). The TOP 1 modifier limits the result to just one row, but without an ORDER BY clause, the row returned is arbitrary and not deterministic.”\n\nHere is the first really big failure in checking this code. “where the Criteria column has the value False (or 0, depending on data type)” there is no way in SQL Server for the value to have a value False without quotes. ‘False’ can be translated to 0 in some cases, but not typically like this. This will work:\n\n1 2 3 4 SELECT CASE WHEN CAST ( 1 as bit ) = 'True' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END , CASE WHEN CAST ( 0 as bit ) = 'True' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END , CASE WHEN CAST ( 1 as bit ) = 'False' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END , CASE WHEN CAST ( 0 as bit ) = 'False' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END\n\nAnd return 1, 0, 0, 1, respectively, but remove the quotes around True or False and you will get an error:\n\nMsg 207, Level 16, State 1, Line 4\n\nInvalid column name 'False'.\n\nContinuing into the reply:\n\n“Checking the Number of Rows Inserted IF @@RowsCount = 0\n\nBreak; @@ROWCOUNT is a system function that returns the number of rows affected by the last statement. Here, it checks if the previous INSERT INTO operation inserted zero rows. If no rows were inserted, the loop exits using the BREAK statement.”\n\nHey something that works correctly as I wrote it. Who saw that coming? That won’t last long.\n\n“End of the WHILE Loop WEND; WEND is not valid SQL Server syntax. The correct keyword to close a WHILE loop in SQL Server is END. The corrected version would look like this: WHILE (condition) BEGIN — Loop body END;”\n\nInterestingly, IT wrote pseudocode by using (condition), but never considered my pseudocode…\n\n“Key Issues in the Code Syntax Errors: CREATE TEMP TABLE should be CREATE TABLE #Results. WEND should be replaced with END. Inefficiency: This code processes rows one at a time, which is inefficient for large datasets. A SELECT statement with appropriate filtering is more efficient. Lack of Determinism: The TOP 1 query lacks an ORDER BY clause, which may lead to inconsistent results. Unclear Loop Condition: The condition (RowsStillInTable) is undefined and would not work in SQL Server.”\n\nMostly true stuff. I don’t think TOP 1 with an ORDER BY technically provides determinism exactly, as data can change while you are looping. You would need to use a temporary table or even a static cursor for that.\n\nBut the description mostly makes sense. And I will give it a pass since I didn’t provide a reasonable use case for using a loop here.\n\nFinally, some advice, but with a bit of a mistake:\n\n“A Correct and Efficient Approach If the goal is to process or filter rows from a table, use a set-based query instead of a loop: SELECT *\n\nINTO #Results\n\nFROM TableName\n\nWHERE Criteria = 0; This query filters all rows meeting the condition (Criteria = 0) and inserts them into the temporary table in a single operation.”\n\nBut if you send them to a temp table, this query basically does nothing. Especially when I said this loop did the same thing as my simple SELECT statement.\n\nIt also takes my pseudocode of = False and assumes I am using a bit, which is a more forgivable rewrite that I may have done myself.\n\nAnd the final advice:\n\n” Conclusion The provided code is syntactically and conceptually flawed for SQL Server. To process data efficiently: Use set-based operations wherever possible. Avoid row-by-row logic unless absolutely necessary. Fix syntax errors like CREATE TEMP TABLE and WEND.”\n\nGenerally, makes sense, except for the fact that I asked: “Explain this code”, not “Tell me what is wrong with it philosophically”\n\nWhat it needed to note was something such as:\n\n“This code appears to be trying to load data into a temporary table #Results. There may be a better way to do this using the following code:\n\nSELECT *\n\nINTO #Results\n\nFROM TableName\n\nWHERE Criteria = 0;\n\nThen perhaps break down the code, tell me the syntax issues, and preach at me that row by row logic is bad.\n\nDocument Telling Us We are looking at bad advice\n\nMy last test was to basically admit that the body of the article was completely garbage. I changed it into a “here is bad advice to not follow” kind of article. So I altered the document to start out as:\n\n“I asked many SQL Server administrators for the absolute dumbest advice they have ever been given by real people recently and this (perhaps a bit too humorous) article is the culmination of what I was told. The advice ranges from horrible to the extremely horrible, but none of it could be considered useful whatsoever.”\n\nWhat I want to know here is whether it pays attention well to the header and judges accordingly. So, I again ask: “Please review the following document in terms of technology” and paste in the document. The reply is kind of spot on (and you can read the entire reply here):\n\n“Review of “Really Bad Advice for SQL Server Administrators” (Technological Perspective) This document is clearly a satirical piece aimed at highlighting poor practices in SQL Server administration. While humorous, its tone may be misinterpreted by novice readers as genuine advice. Below, I address key points raised in the article and provide a brief explanation of why each is bad practice, supported by technical reasoning.”\n\nIgnoring that it says “I address key points” like the computer from 2001 A Space Odyssey, the replies in each section basically ignores the fact that this is satire. If it knows that, it the advice should show that. It should give advice how to keep the satirical edge, but not lead people astray.\n\nFor comparison, the row by row processing section now says:\n\n“Row-by-Row Processing (RBAR) Instead of Set-Based Operations Why This is Bad: Row-by-row processing is significantly slower than set-based operations, as SQL Server is optimized for set-based query execution. Best Practice: Write queries that operate on sets of data rather than iterating through rows.”\n\nWhich is of course good advice, but it really isn’t a good section compared to what I was trying to do and include code. (Which it still doesn”t mention.)\n\nFinally:\n\n“Conclusion The document is an effective humorous critique of common SQL Server mismanagement practices. However, it risks misinterpretation if taken literally. The importance of adhering to best practices—such as maintaining security, scalability, and performance—cannot be overstated. Suggestion: Add a clear disclaimer at the beginning, emphasizing that the advice is intentionally bad and should not be followed. This will help ensure the content is understood as satire.”\n\nI mean, it isn’t really “satire” per ce, it was framed as just bad advice that had been\n\nConclusion\n\nSo far, reasonably good. It is not nearly as good of an editor as a human would be, and it made a few mistakes. But I feel like I have answers my first question “Will it refute the advice clearly?” Not only did it refute the advice, but it called me out on my less than subtle advice.\n\nI think it is clear that after I do this same test with Copilot, I need to refine the concept and be less overt with the advice and be more subtle with my errors. Code that fails for simple reasons. Compatibility levels, typos, invalid semicolons. Advice that is weak but true.\n\nIn fact, that is kind of why I did this series of tests to begin with. I commonly find that these tools I am testing say “this is a good paper” but I find some obvious concerns that are missed. I want to know that overall, at least, it is catching the gist of the paper and general correctness.\n\nEither way, my concerns have somewhat been allayed. This tool definitely did not try to make it out like this was good advice, and it did a good job even with the reverse piece that said explicitly that this was bad advice.\n\nI especially liked that is said “While humorous, its tone may be misinterpreted by novice readers as genuine advice.” I actually did not include the entire fake articles as posts for that very reason, and even zipped them up so they hopefully will not be read by the search engine."}

But women have always played indispensable roles in battle, even if they’ve been historically relegated to the sidelines—and the Vietnam War was no exception. From nurses to first ladies to domineering political revolutionaries, women involved in the Vietnam War never let stifling gender conventions keep them from fighting for their beliefs, whether they were serving behind the scenes or right alongside their male counterparts in battle.\n\nJane Fonda\n\nJane Fonda at an anti-war rally, 1970. | Leif Skoogfors/GettyImages\n\nActress and activist Jane Fonda’s controversial two-week tour of North Vietnam in 1972—in particular, a photo of her peering into the scope of a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun—immediately made her the target of considerable criticism and condemnation from the American public (enraged American media even crudely dubbed her “Hanoi Jane”). The Academy Award-winning actress made numerous appearances on Hanoi Radio, condemning the American military’s actions in Vietnam and calling for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nIn 2013, it was revealed that the communications of both Fonda and her then-husband Tom Hayden were intercepted and monitored by the National Security Agency as part of a controversial, legally dubious domestic espionage operation called Project MINARET that was intended to keep tabs on Americans deemed “domestic threats.” The project also monitored the communications of other prominent anti-war figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Muhammad Ali, and journalist Tom Wicker, among more than a thousand others [PDF].\n\nFonda’s trip later came to represent a watershed moment in the anti-war movement. Though she has stated she has no regrets about her tour of a war-ravaged North Vietnam, she has expressed remorse for the photo of her on the anti-aircraft gun, stating she’d allowed herself to be manipulated through a lapse in judgment. Animosity from Vietnam veterans toward Fonda has persisted even decades after the photo was publicized; it even led to the actress being harassed and spat at during later appearances despite innumerable public apologies.\n\nTrịnh Thị Ngọ, a.k.a. “Hanoi Hannah”\n\nTrinh Thi Ngọ, better known as Hanoi Hannah, was a Vietnamese radio personality who worked at the state-run radio station Radio Hanoi. Ngọ’s broadcasts—in which she recited English scripts written by the North Vietnamese Defense Ministry’s propaganda department—encouraged American troops to defect and decried the United States’ continued escalation of the conflict.\n\nNgọ was born to a wealthy family in Hanoi. She learned English through private lessons provided by her family after she expressed a desire to learn so she could watch her favorite film, 1939’s Gone With The Wind, without subtitles. She volunteered with the Voice of Vietnam, a state-controlled radio broadcaster, in 1955, and went on to secure a position reading the station’s English language broadcasts.\n\nWhile Ngọ’s efficacy in inspiring American GIs to defect was negligible, her lengthy English language broadcasts made her something of a celebrity among American troops; they tuned in for rare occasions of amusement and mockery. Radio Hanoi’s broadcasts of interviews with American anti-war figures like Jane Fonda, however, sparked outrage among the soldiers. After the conclusion of the war, Ngọ relocated to Ho Chi Minh City with her husband, where she remained until her death in September 2016 at the age of 85.\n\nNguyễn Thị Bình, a.k.a. Madame Bình\n\nVietnamese Communist leader Madame Bình arriving in Paris to head the Vietcong delegation, November 4, 1968. | Keystone/GettyImages\n\nNguyễn Thị Bình, better known in Western media as Madame Bình, is a Vietnamese diplomat and revolutionary who served as the Vietcong’s chief representative during the 1973 Paris Peace Accords. Bình was the sole female signatory of the Paris Accords (an agreement that ended the American involvement in the War in Vietnam). A male Vietcong representative was initially intended to replace her following preliminary hearings in Paris, but Binh’s popularity, fluency in French, and increasing international recognition allowed her to keep her position for the remainder of negotiations.\n\nBình was Vietnam’s first woman appointed to a cabinet minister position. She served as Minister of Education for the Socialist Republic of Vietnam following the Fall of Saigon and subsequent communist reunification of Vietnam. After later serving as Chair for the Social Republic of Vietnam’s National Assembly, Bình was elected Vice President of Vietnam in 1992 and again in 1997.\n\nFrances FitzGerald\n\nFrances FitzGerald, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book Fire in the Lake: The Vietnamese and Americans in Vietnam (1972), is an American journalist known for her nuanced coverage of the Vietnam War during the mid-1960s and early-1970s. Whereas many of FitzGerald’s male counterparts focused their coverage strictly on the war’s combat, she instead detailed the war’s seismic effect on South Vietnamese policy and the day-to-day lives of the Vietnamese.\n\nOriginally published in five parts as a piece of The New Yorker’s newly-established “Annals of War” section, Fire in the Lake was an instant critical success and became the first major book authored by an American on the War in Vietnam. FitzGerald’s work argued that the United States government had a poor understanding of Vietnamese history and had no business meddling in the conflict. FitzGerald returned to South Vietnam in 1974, penning articles about life there following the war for publications like The New York Times and The New Yorker.\n\nTrần Lệ Xuân, a.k.a. Madame Nhu\n\nMadame Nhu, the unofficial First Lady of South Vietnam. | Evening Standard/GettyImages\n\nBorn to a wealthy, politically connected Vietnamese family, Trần Lệ Xuân, better known in English as Madame Nhu, served as the de facto First Lady of South Vietnam during her unmarried brother-in-law Ngô Đình Diệm’s tumultuous tenure as president from 1955 until his assassination in 1963. Madame Nhu wielded an immense amount of political influence. She was educated in a distinguished French lyceum in Hanoi and was a wholly indoctrinated francophile and devout Catholic convert by the time she began her rise to power in the 1950s.\n\nNhu established the Women’s Solidarity Movement, a female-led paramilitary group intended to give women the opportunity to join the fight against the Vietcong. She was known for her inflammatory comments and ostentatious persona (and had a reputation for being wildly ambitious and unafraid of confrontation). Nhu attracted significant criticism domestically and internationally for her puritanical Catholic beliefs and push for Vietnam’s adoption of various restrictive “morality laws” that banned things like gambling and contraceptives.\n\nFollowing the Buddhist crisis—a civil resistance campaign led by Buddhist monks in 1963—Nhu made a series of offensive comments regarding unarmed Buddhist protesters killed by police and was publicly disowned by her parents as a result. Her continued offensive and antagonistic public comments caused her and her family’s tenuous relationship with the United States to begin to fray. After President Ngô Đình Diệm and his brother—Madame Nhu’s husband—were assassinated in a 1963 coup orchestrated by the CIA, Nhu spent the remainder of her life as an exile in Europ. Nhu passed away on April 24, 2011 at the age of 86.\n\nSusan Schnall\n\nDespite her deeply held anti-war beliefs, Virginia native Susan Schnall joined the U.S. Navy as a nurse in the late 1960s, assured by recruiters that her duty as a nurse allowed for her to help all people, both enemy and ally alike. She was assigned to the Oakland Naval Hospital in Oakland, California. Schnall quickly became disenchanted with the military and joined the burgeoning antiwar movement sweeping the United States. After demonstration posters she’d hung around the hospital base were quickly torn down, Schnall and her husband, Vietnam War veteran James Rondo, loaded a small plane with leaflets containing anti war sentiments and dropped them from the sky over various San Francisco Bay Area military facilities.\n\nShortly after the flight, Schnall attended an anti-war march in uniform—explicitly violating newly issued regulations barring members of the Navy from participating in “partisan political” demonstrations while in uniform. She was court-martialed for her actions just days later and faced a possible sentence of up to four years in a military prison. Schnall was convicted and sentenced to a year of hard labor and the forfeiture of all pay she’d received from the Navy. After serving her sentence through the continuation of her duties as a nurse at the Oakland Naval Hospital, Schnall was given a bad conduct discharge and turned her attention to continued, lifelong anti-war activism.\n\nVõ Thị Thắng\n\nVõ Thị Thắng—the subject of the iconic “Smile of Victory” photograph—was a communist revolutionary who was arrested after a failed assassination attempt on a suspected spy in the South Vietnamese capital city Saigon. Despite being sentenced to 20 years of hard labor, Thắng quipped, “So you really think your government will last another 20 years?” and smiled as a Japanese photographer captured the unforgettable image. That photograph later made her something of a celebrity; her defiant grin became emblematic of the role of women in the Vietnam War.\n\nAfter serving just a fraction of her sentence, Thắng was released in March 1974 as part of the Paris Peace Accords signed two months earlier. She continued her communist political activity and was appointed standing vice president of the Vietnam Women’s Union, a political organization geared toward advocating for the rights and interests of Vietnamese women and girls. Alongside her work for the Women’s Union, Thắng served as a representative for the Long An Province in the fourth, fifth, and sixth Vietnamese National Assemblies. The Vietnamese stateswoman retired from politics in 2007 and passed away at the age of 68 in late August 2014.\n\nRead More About the Vietnam War:"}

Here’s why Frame Time is the PC gaming stat that matters most", "fullContent": "Among all the game stats that I monitor, the Frame Time Graph is the one that I keep going back to time and time again to fine tune my performance. Here’s why that is…\n\nThe importance of frame time\n\nThe Frame Time Graph is a measurement of the amount of time it takes for a single frame to be rendered on screen. You can access it in most frame rate counters — like MSI Afterburner — but there are also specialist frame-time capture tools like CapFrame X that specialize in capturing and analyzing frame time.\n\nThese apps are handy for recording, analyzing, and comparing Frame Time Graphs for different games and for different hardware configurations so that you can gauge how your PC should perform. Indeed, there’s a lot you can surmise about the Frame Time Graphs of two different graphics cards running the same game. But what is frame time anyway, and why should you care?\n\nIt’s important to note how frame time differs from frame rate. While the frame rate indicates how many frames are shown on screen per second, the frame time measures the time interval between each of those frames.\n\nA graph of this data, therefore, gives a visual representation of the time between frames over time. This tells us how well a PC produces frames at a consistent pace.\n\nThe FPS is still an important metric that I look at, and should always be included when you’re analyzing frame time, but it doesn’t give me the same kind of information about pacing. In a nutshell, frame rate is a gauge of performance, whereas the frame time tells me more about the experience of playing the game — which is what really counts.\n\nFor example, in a game in which my PC is producing an average 60 FPS, an ideal frame time is 16.6 milliseconds between frames (1/60th of a second), which means the gameplay will be smooth and stutter free.\n\nIf I see that rising to longer frame times, say spikes of 52 milliseconds per frame halfway into a map, it usually means there’s stuttering and choppiness. That’s despite the average FPS being quite good.\n\nHow I read the Frame Time Graph\n\nReading the Frame Time Graph is easy. The vertical axis shows the frame time (in ms) whereas the horizontal axis indicates the frame number or recording time.\n\nWhat I ideally want to see is as close to a flat line as possible. When I say flat, it’s normal for there to be some variation in frame time, such as when you’re on the move from location to location in a first-person shooter — you just don’t want to see big spikes that last a long time.\n\nIf I see big spikes in the frame times, then there’s a problem that I need to investigate. Stutter and choppiness are the hardest things to put up with while gaming, even worse than low FPS.\n\nAsk yourself what could be causing a frame time spike? Dominic Bayley / Foundry\n\nIn fact, if I had to choose between gaming with a quick FPS that slowed down intermittently, or a slower FPS that stayed consistent throughout my game, I’d choose the slower FPS any day. Why? Because the brain just isn’t wired to deal with constant interruptions even if they are just milliseconds brief.\n\nIt’s the same reason you can happily watch a black and white Charlie Chaplin movie running at a lowly 15 FPS (which seems so slow by our current cinematic standard of 24 FPS) as long as it plays at a consistent 15 FPS. But if it were to suddenly spike or drop FPS halfway through, watching it would become unbearable.\n\nWhat to do if you find an issue\n\nMy goal once I’ve discovered spikes in the Frame Time Graph is to make frame time more consistent again. To do that I have a look at other key stats like my CPU’s core and GPU utilization to pinpoint exactly where the problem lies.\n\nThen I’ll troubleshoot settings and tweak things like my resolution, OS settings, or else my hardware settings in response. This will often resolve or at least ameliorate the problem. I’ll also do things like check that I have the correct video drivers and/or the required Nvidia software loaded.\n\nThe beauty about monitoring a Frame Time Graph is that if I watch it closely, I can tell exactly what specific parts of my game I was in when the spike occurred. Sometimes that can allow me to find a quick fix.\n\nFor example, if it happened in a part of the game that required intensive rendering, all that may be needed is a change to the texture or shadow settings in the game menu.\n\nIf my settings tweaks fail to make a difference, though, it could mean that my hardware is just too underpowered for the game. Then again, if my PC meets the developer’s recommended hardware specs (or above) it’s usually the game to blame, in that it’s poorly coded.\n\nThis is a cause of frame time problems more often than it should be. We saw this with the games Gotham Knights and Elden Ring, both of which had shader compilation problems that resulted in frame time inconsistencies and stuttering.\n\nIf it is the latter, unfortunately there’s not a lot you can do about it, bar putting a limit on the frame rate to try to optimize the frame pacing.

Here’s why that is…\n\nThe importance of frame time\n\nThe Frame Time Graph is a measurement of the amount of time it takes for a single frame to be rendered on screen. You can access it in most frame rate counters — like MSI Afterburner — but there are also specialist frame-time capture tools like CapFrame X that specialize in capturing and analyzing frame time.\n\nThese apps are handy for recording, analyzing, and comparing Frame Time Graphs for different games and for different hardware configurations so that you can gauge how your PC should perform. Indeed, there’s a lot you can surmise about the Frame Time Graphs of two different graphics cards running the same game. But what is frame time anyway, and why should you care?\n\nIt’s important to note how frame time differs from frame rate. While the frame rate indicates how many frames are shown on screen per second, the frame time measures the time interval between each of those frames.\n\nA graph of this data, therefore, gives a visual representation of the time between frames over time. This tells us how well a PC produces frames at a consistent pace.\n\nThe FPS is still an important metric that I look at, and should always be included when you’re analyzing frame time, but it doesn’t give me the same kind of information about pacing. In a nutshell, frame rate is a gauge of performance, whereas the frame time tells me more about the experience of playing the game — which is what really counts.\n\nFor example, in a game in which my PC is producing an average 60 FPS, an ideal frame time is 16.6 milliseconds between frames (1/60th of a second), which means the gameplay will be smooth and stutter free.\n\nIf I see that rising to longer frame times, say spikes of 52 milliseconds per frame halfway into a map, it usually means there’s stuttering and choppiness. That’s despite the average FPS being quite good.\n\nHow I read the Frame Time Graph\n\nReading the Frame Time Graph is easy. The vertical axis shows the frame time (in ms) whereas the horizontal axis indicates the frame number or recording time.\n\nWhat I ideally want to see is as close to a flat line as possible. When I say flat, it’s normal for there to be some variation in frame time, such as when you’re on the move from location to location in a first-person shooter — you just don’t want to see big spikes that last a long time.\n\nIf I see big spikes in the frame times, then there’s a problem that I need to investigate. Stutter and choppiness are the hardest things to put up with while gaming, even worse than low FPS.\n\nAsk yourself what could be causing a frame time spike? Dominic Bayley / Foundry\n\nIn fact, if I had to choose between gaming with a quick FPS that slowed down intermittently, or a slower FPS that stayed consistent throughout my game, I’d choose the slower FPS any day. Why? Because the brain just isn’t wired to deal with constant interruptions even if they are just milliseconds brief.\n\nIt’s the same reason you can happily watch a black and white Charlie Chaplin movie running at a lowly 15 FPS (which seems so slow by our current cinematic standard of 24 FPS) as long as it plays at a consistent 15 FPS. But if it were to suddenly spike or drop FPS halfway through, watching it would become unbearable.\n\nWhat to do if you find an issue\n\nMy goal once I’ve discovered spikes in the Frame Time Graph is to make frame time more consistent again. To do that I have a look at other key stats like my CPU’s core and GPU utilization to pinpoint exactly where the problem lies.\n\nThen I’ll troubleshoot settings and tweak things like my resolution, OS settings, or else my hardware settings in response. This will often resolve or at least ameliorate the problem. I’ll also do things like check that I have the correct video drivers and/or the required Nvidia software loaded.\n\nThe beauty about monitoring a Frame Time Graph is that if I watch it closely, I can tell exactly what specific parts of my game I was in when the spike occurred. Sometimes that can allow me to find a quick fix.\n\nFor example, if it happened in a part of the game that required intensive rendering, all that may be needed is a change to the texture or shadow settings in the game menu.\n\nIf my settings tweaks fail to make a difference, though, it could mean that my hardware is just too underpowered for the game. Then again, if my PC meets the developer’s recommended hardware specs (or above) it’s usually the game to blame, in that it’s poorly coded.\n\nThis is a cause of frame time problems more often than it should be. We saw this with the games Gotham Knights and Elden Ring, both of which had shader compilation problems that resulted in frame time inconsistencies and stuttering.\n\nIf it is the latter, unfortunately there’s not a lot you can do about it, bar putting a limit on the frame rate to try to optimize the frame pacing. Or else you can politely ask the developer to look into it and provide a patch or an update that will fix the problem.\n\nMost developers will try to resolve any issues like this, so if you do identify issues, it’s always worthwhile letting them know.\n\nFurther reading: Fullscreen vs. borderless?

The RTX 5060 Ti is now officially launched, and Adam and Will in the PCWorld labs have their hands on both of them. Check out how they performed in the latest YouTube video.\n\nSadly the only review units that Nvidia sent out were variations on the 16GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti. The 8GB version should be on store shelves, at least theoretically and for a few seconds before it sells out, but it doesn’t look like many reviews are popping up on launch day. But the good news is that the 16GB version, which has an MSRP of $429 (yeah, we’ll see about that), is pretty darn good.\n\nIn the initial benchmark rundown, Adam kept the comparisons as relevant as possible: an apples-to-apples comparison with the last-gen RTX 4060 Ti, also in 16GB flavor, the step-up RTX 5070, and the Radeon 7700 XT (which is AMD’s comparable card for the Nvidia 40-series). In short, the new card is pretty darn good, even if you’re not interested in Nvidia’s heavily pushed upscaling, frame generation, or ray tracing goodies.\n\nRestricting the testing to pure raster-based benchmarks at 1080p, the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB saw a boost from 8 percent to 32 percent over the last generation. That wasn’t always enough to beat AMD’s 7700 XT, but it was in some games like Rainbow Six Siege and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Things were similar with a little bit of ray tracing goodness added on top, with the new card edging out AMD and beating the 4060 Ti by 10-20 percent. For heavy ray tracing like Black Myth Wukong, you can see even more than that.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a great all-in-one test bench for new cards. And the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti got dramatically better results than the 4060 Ti, bumping up 32 percent on pure raster performance. It gained 14 percent on the intense path tracing and upscaling test with DLSS but no frame generation. When you flip on frame generation (wherein Nvidia can insert three card-generated frames for every one rasterized frame), it more than doubles the performance versus the 4060 Ti…which you’d expect, since that generation of card can only do x2 frame gen instead of x4. Limiting it to the same x2 bump on both cards, the 5060 Ti can get a 14 percent boost.\n\nAI and video editing performance showed approximately the same 15-20 percent boost, and the power consumption for the new card showed that it’s running at about the same level of electricity as the 4060 Ti, and well below the AMD card tested. But the big question remaining is, how much will these cards really cost you…and how long will those prices remain stable as the US taxes and trade war with China creates extreme instability in this and other markets.\n\nYou also might want to wait for the cheaper 5060 non-Ti ($300 MSRP) and 5060 Ti 8GB ($380) for a more even comparison. While you wait, be sure to subscribe to PCWorld on YouTube and check out our weekly podcast, The Full Nerd. Yesterday’s episode was all about the new Nvidia cards."}

In a detailed report by This Is Anfield, it was revealed that 23-year-old Czech goalkeeper Vitezslav Jaros has not entered the final weeks of his Liverpool contract as many believed. Contrary to prior reports—including those circulated by Transfermarkt—Jaros agreed new terms with the Reds in early 2024.\n\nThis development was unearthed through the FA’s list of agent transactions from February 2024 to February 2025, where Jaros’ name appeared, indicating a contract extension tied to his loan move to Austrian side Sturm Graz.\n\nSo while the headlines around Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold’s contracts continue to dominate attention, this quieter bit of business could prove just as important in shaping Liverpool’s future depth chart.\n\nGoalkeeping Depth Brings New Questions\n\nManager Arne Slot will head into pre-season with four senior goalkeepers: Alisson, Caoimhin Kelleher, Jaros, and Giorgi Mamardashvili, the latter expected to arrive from Valencia. Slot commented earlier this year, “We’ve bought a goalkeeper and sent him on loan and next season we will have Alisson, Caoimhin, Jaros and Mamardashvili.”\n\nIt’s an impressive list, but it’s highly unlikely all four remain at Anfield come September.\n\nKelleher, who has made no secret of his ambition to play regular first-team football, is expected to move on. This Is Anfield notes that “a sale is highly likely” with clubs like Bournemouth reportedly interested. His contract runs until 2026, meaning Liverpool are in a strong negotiating position and could command a solid fee.\n\nJaros’ Career at a Crossroads\n\nJaros, who made his senior debut for Liverpool in a 1-0 Premier League win over Crystal Palace, and later featured in the 3-2 Carabao Cup victory over Brighton, has impressed in his limited appearances. His time on loan at Sturm Graz appears to have been instrumental in his development—and in the club’s decision to extend his deal.\n\nStill, whether he remains part of Liverpool’s long-term plans remains uncertain. As This Is Anfield puts it: “There is also a strong chance Jaros will be pushing for first-team football elsewhere.” After playing third fiddle for most of the season, he’ll want more minutes—something Liverpool may not be able to offer right now.\n\nHowever, with a fresh contract in place, Liverpool are well-positioned to either integrate him more fully or negotiate a favourable transfer.\n\nQuiet Business Behind the Scenes\n\nJaros wasn’t the only one whose contract was quietly updated. Alongside him, deals for Harvey Davies, Kaide Gordon, Lewis Koumas, Fabian Mrozek, Terence Miles, and Reece Trueman were also restructured over the past year. Jarell Quansah’s extension was confirmed publicly back in October.\n\nSlot’s emphasis on retaining a pool of young, promising talent appears to be part of a broader strategy of depth and flexibility—particularly as Liverpool prepare for life beyond Jurgen Klopp and a summer of significant squad restructuring.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a fan’s perspective, this Jaros update is a welcome surprise. While the attention naturally gravitates toward the big names, having a reliable and developing goalkeeper like Jaros quietly secure his future is exactly the kind of sensible business we want to see more of.\n\nThe fact that his contract was tied to the Sturm Graz loan shows real intent from the club—it wasn’t just a short-term patch job. It was strategic, and that signals trust in Jaros’ future potential, whether at Liverpool or as a valuable asset on the market.\n\nArne Slot now has a mix of elite and emerging goalkeepers at his disposal. Alisson is still world-class, Mamardashvili comes with promise, and Jaros brings youthful hunger. If Kelleher moves on, as expected, it could open up space for Jaros to step in as No. 2—a role many fans would be excited to see him embrace.\n\nLet’s not forget—this is a goalkeeper who has waited patiently, made the most of his chances, and shown professionalism throughout. With more first-team opportunities, who’s to say he won’t surprise a few more people next season?"}

Among them: Virgil van Dijk, Anthony Gordon, and the increasingly intriguing words of David Ornstein.\n\nDave reminds listeners that Ornstein’s reports carry weight: “This was David Ornstein saying to CBS… Arsenal admire Anthony Gordon.” It’s a moment that grounds the conversation in concrete reporting, as Trev adds, “We’ve built up Ornstein and Joyce previously to these almost infallible… ex cathedra types.”\n\nWhile Ornstein is careful in his delivery, the implications of his Gordon story are significant. “He has just signed a contract, absolutely,” Dave confirms, “but this is David Ornstein saying that Arsenal really like Anthony Gordon.” A rumour? Yes. Dismissible? Absolutely not.\n\nVan Dijk Era and Slot’s Selection\n\nVirgil van Dijk remains a touchstone for fans. While his name isn’t central to this week’s departures, the broader discussion reflects a reality check about who is truly untouchable under Arne Slot. Trev puts it plainly: “This is not the Jurgen Klopp era… everyone’s in it together. There’s a huge reluctance for anyone to depart.” That camaraderie is now replaced by an analytical detachment.\n\nDave adds: “There’s a lot of players it’s quite clear Arne Slot doesn’t fancy.” Names like Jarell Quansah are explicitly discussed, and Dave doesn’t hold back: “He’s clearly not particularly fancied by Arne Slot… he’s only coming on now at emergency right back.”\n\nAs unsettling as this may sound, both hosts stress a pragmatic perspective. Trev summarises the sentiment: “It would not surprise me one bit if any of them moved on… not at all.”\n\nNew Faces and Emerging Strategies\n\nTransfers in and out define any summer rebuild, and for Liverpool, the speculation is fierce. Bournemouth’s players are repeatedly name-checked—particularly Kerkez and Semenyo—but as Dave warns, “Bournemouth are being really clear: we’ve got our own aspirations… hands off for most.”\n\nIn terms of new arrivals, Dave confirms Liverpool’s interest in players like Dean Huijsen and Xavi Simons, calling them potential spearheads of a “Liverpool transfer revolution.” Yet, the standout commentary is about who will leave. “There’s just a lot of players Arne Slot doesn’t fancy,” Dave repeats, a refrain that builds the episode’s emotional tempo.\n\nTransfer Mood: Frustration and Hope\n\nThe episode also addresses the emotional undercurrent among fans. “Just take it for what it’s worth,” Trev advises listeners amid mounting speculation, “don’t shoot the messenger.”\n\nHe captures the bubbling tension best near the end: “When the Reds get the job done… nobody has to pretend anymore… The wheels could come right off with some of those guys.” This isn’t doom-laden prophesy, but an honest reckoning with transition. Arne Slot is his own man, and as Dave notes: “It’s a new guy, and we’ve had almost a season’s worth of tensions to build up.”\n\nIn a week where the Premier League title is mathematically within reach—“Liverpool can win the Premier League by the 20th of April,” Dave states—the show smartly blends pragmatism with hope. Trev sums it up: “I want the best of both worlds. And if we do get that… things are going to go bananas.”"}

[ Adapted from S. Maity. [ 1\n\net al. [ Adapted from S. Maity. [ 1 ×\n\nA central goal of spintronics is to create and manipulate spin-polarized currents. Typically, spintronic devices rely on magnetic electrodes for spin injection. However, a graphene–antiferromagnet interface could potentially offer a more efficient and energy-saving way to control current, functioning like an electrostatic gate. Theorists have predicted that magnons—collective spin excitations in a material—could couple to electrons at this interface, thereby mediating electron transport. Now Sujan Maity of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science and his colleagues have measured the predicted electron–magnon coupling [1]. The interaction at the interface allows for direct spin-to-charge conversion without the need for magnetic electrodes.\n\nThe researchers created two different types of 2D heterostructures, each consisting of an antiferromagnetic layer (FePS 3 ) sandwiched between few-layer graphene in a different orientation. Applying an electric field parallel to the graphene surface produced an electric current and, with it, a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface. Measuring electrical and magnetic properties in each device revealed two main features. First, magnon “stiffness”—a measure of resistance to spin deformation in the antiferromagnetic layer—decreased as the temperature was lowered. Second, the graphene layer exhibited negative magnetoresistance—a decrease in resistivity in response to an external magnetic field—at temperatures as high as 100 K. Negative magnetoresitance typically occurs at significantly lower temperatures.\n\nTo investigate these unexpected findings, the researchers turned to analytical models based on charge–magnon interactions. The coupling was described through an interaction that exchanges angular momentum between electron spins and magnons. Notably, the presence of a magnetic field plays a crucial role in this process, leading to magnon-to-charge conversion at the interface. The measurements and their explanation could hasten the development of spin-based logic devices and magnetic sensors.\n\n–Rachel Berkowitz\n\nRachel Berkowitz is a Corresponding Editor for Physics Magazine based in Vancouver, Canada."}

As revealed by … [+4660 chars]", "title": "Liverpool ‘Stepping Up’ Their Pursuit of £70m Striker Ahead of Potential Summer Move – Report", "fullContent": "Liverpool’s Search for a New No. 9 Intensifies Amid Hugo Ekitike Interest\n\nWith the summer transfer window fast approaching, Liverpool are ramping up their pursuit of a new striker – and the latest name to rise up the list is Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike. As revealed by TEAMtalk, the 22-year-old is attracting serious attention from Anfield, as uncertainty continues to swirl around the future of Darwin Núñez.\n\nIt’s no secret Liverpool have long admired Alexander Isak, but Newcastle United’s £150m+ valuation appears to have priced him out of reach. That has forced new manager Arne Slot and sporting director Richard Hughes to explore more financially viable options. Enter Ekitike – a player with bags of potential, a growing reputation in Europe, and importantly, a far more palatable price tag.\n\n“Liverpool are indeed one of several Premier League sides to have looked at Ekitike and are evaluating him as a potential target,” TEAMtalk reports.\n\nEkitike, currently enjoying a prolific season in the Bundesliga after a permanent move from Paris Saint-Germain, has netted 21 goals for Frankfurt – an impressive tally for a player still establishing himself at senior level. His goal in the 1-1 Europa League quarter-final draw against Spurs was yet another example of his sharp instincts in front of goal.\n\nFour-way Battle for Frankfurt’s Rising Star\n\nLiverpool’s interest in Ekitike is part of a broader Premier League scramble. According to TEAMtalk, three other English clubs have also made recent enquiries about the Frenchman. That competition could drive up the fee, with Frankfurt reportedly holding out for around £70 million – a sum that would make Ekitike the second-most expensive sale in their history after Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nStill, the figure is less than half the potential Isak fee, and with Ekitike under contract until 2029, Frankfurt are not under pressure to sell. But the key factor here may be the player’s willingness to move to England.\n\n“Sources state that… the striker is very interested in a move to England,” TEAMtalk notes. That desire could be a major boost for Liverpool’s chances – especially if they can present a clear vision under Arne Slot that includes consistent game time and Champions League football.\n\nEkitike’s Redemption Arc Aligns with Liverpool’s Ethos\n\nThere’s a strong narrative thread that may appeal to Liverpool’s recruitment model. Ekitike’s career path hasn’t been smooth. A disappointing spell at PSG cast doubt over his long-term development, but his revitalisation at Frankfurt shows resilience and a hunger to improve – qualities Liverpool have traditionally valued highly.\n\nAs TEAMtalk explains, “The 22-year-old has had a tumultuous football career so far but has flourished since his move from Paris Saint-Germain to Frankfurt last summer.”\n\nSuch a trajectory echoes past Liverpool signings who arrived with something to prove – think Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané or even Diogo Jota. Under the right guidance, Ekitike could follow in similar footsteps.\n\nWhat This means for Darwin Núñez\n\nWhile not explicitly stated, Liverpool’s active pursuit of another striker inevitably raises questions about Darwin Núñez. The Uruguayan forward has endured a stop-start campaign, struggling with inconsistency and decision-making in key moments. Slot may be looking for a more clinical alternative – someone like Ekitike, who can lead the line or partner with a forward in a flexible system.\n\nShould Ekitike arrive, it could either motivate Núñez to find another level – or signal a changing of the guard in Liverpool’s attack.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs Liverpool fans, we’ve grown used to seeing the club work smartly in the transfer market, and this potential move for Ekitike feels like a classic Reds gamble – one that could pay big dividends. At just 22, with Bundesliga and European experience already under his belt, he offers huge upside without the eye-watering cost of a player like Isak.\n\nYes, £70m is no small sum, but in today’s inflated market, it could look like a bargain in two seasons’ time if Ekitike continues on this upward trajectory. His goal-scoring form in Germany, coupled with his desire to play in the Premier League, suggests he could thrive in the high-intensity system that Slot is expected to implement.\n\nWhat’s more encouraging is the timing. Acting swiftly in the market – particularly when four other clubs are circling – would signal intent from the new era at Anfield. If Slot wants to put his stamp on this side, bringing in a young, hungry forward like Ekitike could be an ideal first move.\n\nWe also believe the arrival of someone like Hugo wouldn’t necessarily spell the end for Núñez. Competition breeds excellence. And if Núñez stays, a dual-pronged threat could be exactly what Liverpool need to unlock deep defensive blocks next season.\n\nAll in all, this is one to keep a close eye on – and credit to TEAMtalk for breaking the story."}

The 17-year-old midfielder, already turning heads with his mature displays in the Championship, has attracted scouts from Manchester United, Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace, and West Ham, with Merseyside’s two clubs the latest to register interest.\n\n“Rigg has been scouted on numerous occasions this season by a variety of Premier League clubs,” notes iNews, underlining the level of attention this young man is garnering.\n\nA Future Shaped by Sunderland’s Promotion Hopes\n\nThe future of Rigg, who has two years remaining on his current Sunderland deal, seems likely to hinge on whether the Black Cats can earn promotion to the Premier League. Currently chasing their first return to the top flight since 2017, Sunderland have embraced a development-first approach, giving youngsters like Rigg an essential platform.\n\n“He’ll likely stay at the Stadium of Light if they are successful in their bid to return to the top flight,” the article states. Such an outcome could see the midfielder commit his future with a new contract.\n\nHowever, should Sunderland fall short, a summer move could beckon, with speculation suggesting any fee would need to rival the £30 million Tottenham paid Leeds for Archie Gray last year.\n\nLiverpool Planning a Summer Refresh\n\nAt Anfield, the interest in Rigg is especially significant given the club’s anticipated squad overhaul. Despite a title charge under new manager Arne Slot, the Reds are expected to enter a transitional phase, with potential exits for Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz, as well as continuing questions around Harvey Elliott’s game time.\n\nRigg, described as an “all-action” and “dynamic” midfielder, could be viewed as a long-term option in Liverpool’s engine room—particularly appealing due to his age, technical profile, and energy levels. The potential to mould him into a Slot-style pressing machine will not go unnoticed by the club’s data-led recruitment team.\n\nEverton’s Rebuilding Project Under Moyes\n\nAcross Stanley Park, David Moyes has inspired a mini-revival at Everton. Since returning for a second spell following Sean Dyche’s dismissal, Moyes has stabilised the Toffees, guiding them to safety and a respectable mid-table position. His side’s current form—five wins, six draws and only three defeats in 14 matches—offers hope of brighter days.\n\nHowever, Everton’s long-term prospects demand an injection of youth. With one of the oldest squads in the Premier League, adding a player like Rigg could represent the first steps toward a more balanced and future-focused roster.\n\n“They are in need of fresh faces,” the article notes. Rigg, with his technical quality and versatility, could thrive in Moyes’ disciplined structure while gaining valuable first-team exposure.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThere’s always an element of risk involved in signing teenage talents, especially those yet to feature regularly at Premier League level. But Chris Rigg looks like a calculated bet worth taking—especially for a Liverpool side about to embark on a new era under Arne Slot.\n\nRigg’s profile aligns with the club’s long-term strategy of targeting high-upside youngsters who can be developed into elite performers. His maturity, work rate, and fearless approach make him an enticing option, particularly if midfield reinforcements are needed due to departures. With Curtis Jones, Elliott and Bajcetic already in the mix, Rigg could join a growing homegrown core tasked with writing the next chapter of Anfield’s history.\n\nFrom a supporter’s perspective, there’s also something reassuring in seeing Liverpool prioritise domestic talent. While continental gems often grab the headlines, there’s real value in backing English youth—especially one already proving himself in a physically demanding league like the Championship.\n\nAnd there’s the emotional pull too. If Rigg were to join and flourish, the Reds would have secured another local lad ready to carry the club’s identity forward. He might not be the finished article yet, but at just 17, his ceiling is enormous. If Sunderland don’t go up, and Liverpool act swiftly, this could be a deal remembered fondly in years to come."}

The 19-year-old Dutch international has impressed during his stint at Bournemouth, and his performance in their 1-0 win over Fulham on Monday Night Football seems to have accelerated talks between the clubs.\n\nAs reported earlier this week, a double swoop involving Huijsen and left-back Milos Kerkez could cost the Reds up to £95m. Arne Slot, in his first season at Anfield, has made a remarkable impact, guiding Liverpool within touching distance of the Premier League title. With only two wins needed to secure the crown after their win over West Ham and Arsenal’s slip-up against Brentford, the focus is gradually turning to squad building for next season.\n\nDespite making only one major addition in Federico Chiesa, Slot’s transformation of Liverpool’s tactical identity has earned him significant praise. However, with ambitions to build a side in his own image, this summer promises to be one of calculated but ambitious spending — and Huijsen is expected to be a cornerstone of that vision.\n\nJarell Quansah Set for Summer Exit\n\nThe arrival of Huijsen is set to have direct consequences for one of Liverpool’s homegrown stars. Jarell Quansah, who has made 56 appearances for the first team since breaking through in the 2023/24 campaign, appears poised for a move away from Anfield.\n\nFabrizio Romano, speaking on his Here We Go podcast, has revealed that Newcastle United are leading the race for the 22-year-old defender.\n\n“I’ll keep an eye on Jarell Quansah because he is very good and very talented,” Romano explained. “But, I think, sometimes you want to play.”\n\nHe went on to highlight the crowded competition in Liverpool’s defensive ranks:\n\n“So you have Virgil van Dijk and the [new] contract. Ibrahima Konate is still there. There is interest in Dean Huijsen. Liverpool have many players in that position.”\n\nRomano confirmed that alongside Newcastle, there is “also interest from the Bundesliga,” with Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen both reportedly monitoring the situation. Inter Milan are also believed to be weighing up a move as they seek reinforcements at the back.\n\nSlot’s Tactical Demands May Spell End for Quansah\n\nSlot’s decision-making has shown a clear preference for defenders comfortable on the ball and adept at building from the back. That, more than anything, could be the decisive factor in Quansah’s expected departure.\n\nSpeaking after leaving Quansah out of the starting XI for the Merseyside derby, Slot shared:\n\n“Jarell did quite OK in that position, to be fair, and he would have helped us with set-pieces. But I felt – we felt – that we had to play better with the ball.”\n\nThe message is clear: while Quansah has rarely let the side down, he may not fit the tactical profile required for Slot’s evolving system. Liverpool are thought to be seeking between £35m and £50m for the Warrington-born defender.\n\nTransfer Activity Heating Up Across the Pitch\n\nLiverpool’s summer transfer plans don’t end with Huijsen and Kerkez. Sources indicate that the club are now pressing ahead with moves for the highly-rated Ajax defender, Jorell Hato, a player long on Arsenal’s radar. With the Gunners reportedly rattled by Liverpool’s late push, a bidding war could ensue.\n\nIn attack, the Reds are prepared to spend big to support Mohamed Salah, who will remain at the club. Reports from Spain suggest that Liverpool are ready to table a €150m (£130.1m) offer for a marquee forward to complement their Egyptian star.\n\nFurthermore, the club are in the mix for Brighton winger Kaoru Mitoma, with the Seagulls ready to cash in on the Japan international. Liverpool are also keeping tabs on a top Italian midfielder, though Manchester City are expected to be strong rivals for his signature.\n\nAs things stand, Liverpool’s recruitment drive under Slot looks set to shift gears, with the Huijsen deal likely to be the first of several statements of intent as they prepare for life after Klopp — and possibly life as English champions."}

The email noted that the company receives around 10,000 reports of sextortion each month—and that figure is likely “only a fraction of the total abuse occurring on the platform.”\n\nThis statistic prompted us to investigate what else Snap Inc. knows or believes about the impact of its product on users, particularly teens (We estimate that roughly 13 million American 13-17 year-olds use Snapchat). Over the past several months, we have examined multiple court cases filed against Snap Inc., many involving severe or fatal harm that was (allegedly) facilitated by Snapchat’s features. From 2022 through 2025, as part of the Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) and Judicial Council Coordinated Proceedings (JCCP) against social media defendants, more than 600 such lawsuits specifically named Snap Inc. as a defendant. In addition, state attorneys general from Nevada and New Mexico have brought significant cases against the company—two cases which we will draw heavily from in this post.\n\nFollowing the format of our previous post about the “industrial scale harms” attributed to TikTok, this piece presents dozens of quotations from internal reports, studies, memos, conversations, and public statements in which Snap executives, employees, and consultants acknowledge and discuss the harms that Snapchat causes to many minors who use their platform. We group these findings into five key clusters of harms:\n\nAddictive, Compulsive, and Problematic Use Drugs and Guns Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Sextortion, and In-person Sexual Predation and Assault Cyberbullying Knowledge of Harm and Underage Use, and Lack of Action\n\nSimilar to TikTok, we show that company insiders were aware of multiple widespread and serious harms, and in many cases did not act promptly or make substantial changes. As Snap’s director of security engineering said regarding Android users who are selling drugs or child sexual abuse material on Snap:\n\n“That’s fine it’s been broken for ten years we can tolerate tonight.”\n\nWith regard to sextortion on the platform, one employee had complained in a private channel:\n\n“God I’m so pissed that were over-run by this sextortion shit right now. We’ve twiddled our thumbs and wrung our hands all f…ing year.”\n\nThe briefs allege that the company is also aware of rampant underage use, and of the ineffectiveness of their age gating process. Snap executives have admitted that Snapchat’s age verification system\n\n“Is effectively useless in stopping underage users from signing up to the Snapchat app.”\n\nAlthough the evidence below is all publicly available, no one has compiled and combined direct quotations from company insiders and internal reports across multiple alleged harms. We think this compilation gives vital information to parents, who might want some insight into the business practices of a company that hosts their children’s social lives, owns much of their attention, and influences their social development.\n\nAt the start of each section, we highlight a real-life example—drawn from relevant court documents—illustrating the specific harm in question. Each child’s story offers a human perspective on the broader statistics and quotations that reveal the far-reaching harms discussed within the company.\n\n1. Our Conversations with Snap, Inc.\n\nWhile working on this post we had four conversations with Snap’s leaders and employees during which we asked them about some of the harms that appear in the various briefs. In three of those meetings, we asked specifically about the claim, taken from an internal Snap email that was quoted in the New Mexico brief, that Snap gets 10,000 reports of sextortion each month. We did not get any rebuttals or explanations of that claim.\n\nSnap’s Trust and Safety team made a point that we think is valid and important for readers to keep in mind: the briefs we are drawing from present the allegations of one side in litigation, and there is often another side. Some of the quotations may have been misinterpreted or taken out of context. Snap’s Trust and Safety team pointed us to a motion Snap made to have the New Mexico case dismissed. We read that brief and found that it contested only a few of the many claims made in the New Mexico brief. Two of these claims had been in our list of quotations, so we cut one from the post below, and we added a comment to the other.\n\nSnap’s Trust and Safety team also shared various measures they take to mitigate harm to children and teenagers. The Trust and Safety team said that child safety is their top priority and they told us that they proactively remove significant amounts of harmful content. In Snap’s motion to dismiss they state that Snap has “doubled the size of its Trust and Safety team and tripled the size of its Law Enforcement Operations team since 2020” which has “improved Snap’s ability to act quickly when Snapchat users report harassment or improper sexual content on the platform.”\n\nWe have no doubt that Snap does remove large quantities of harmful content from its platform, or that they are trying to remove even more. However, it is difficult to assess whether Snap is solving 5% or 75% or 99% of the problem since its metrics focus on the number of pieces of content removed rather than the percentage of Snapchat users who experience harm on the platform. Even if Snap were to remove a billion pieces of drug or sex related content each year, many teen users may still encounter such content every day. And any teen who wants to buy drugs may still find it easy to find dealers, as has happened in many tragic cases of fentanyl poisoning, including very recent cases. Many may still report seeing sexual content, as there are many ways for users to be sexually explicit without violating policies.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective: if you were choosing which summer camp to send your teen to, would it be reassuring to learn that a camp used to remove 100 sharks a month from its coastal swimming area, but now they remove 500 a month? Probably not reassuring at all. As a parent, you’d much prefer a camp that put its resources into prevention—such as by putting an effective shark barrier around the swimming area—rather than one that focused on catching sharks more quickly after campers report seeing their fins.\n\nWe also had the opportunity to discuss many of our observations about Snapchat’s features with both their leadership and their trust and safety teams. We appreciated their willingness to engage with us. We suggested to them some design changes that we believe would make the platform less addictive and less harmful:\n\nRemove the Quick Add feature for minors, which is one of the main ways that adult predators and drug dealers get access to teens. Remove the streaks feature, which causes many teens to send photos to each other compulsively, needlessly increasing their time on the app. Remove beauty filters for minors Remove engagement-based algorithms, at the very least, for underage users. Stop deleting posts on Snap’s own servers. The fact that Snap does not store the content of conversations (beyond a limited period) is helpful for drug dealers, sextortionists, and others with criminal intent, but it does not improve the user experience of most children to know that even if something goes terribly wrong, their conversations cannot be discovered by law enforcement officers. Do a lot more to remove underage users. Snap is widely used in middle schools. (A 2021 survey by Common Sense Media reported that 13% of 8 to 12 year olds said they had “ever used” Snapchat. We therefore estimate that in 2021 in the U.S., about 2.7 million children ages 8 to 12 had used Snapchat.)\n\nOne broader request we made was to collaborate on publicly accessible user experience research that could help quantify and reduce the harms we describe below. It would be important to know precisely what percentage of kids receive unwanted advances on their platform, or know how to access drugs - which are very different questions from the ones that they generally answer publicly. Such assessments have been called for by company whistleblowers and public health experts.\n\nWe remain hopeful that Snap will act on some of these requests. Nonetheless, we decided to move forward with this post because whatever safety improvements have been made in recent years, and whatever improvements Snap says it will make in the future, we believe it remains essential for the public to understand the dangers associated with Snapchat, as expressed by Snap’s own employees and consultants, who are quoted in numerous court documents that have emerged in recent years.\n\nWhile the company has clearly made efforts to address some of these concerns, transparency about their past actions and insider beliefs about the platform's impact are critical for those of us trying to understand: how did we get here? What on earth happened in the early 2010s such that there is now an international youth mental health crisis, increasing evidence of attentional fragmentation and declining functional intelligence, and countless cases of severe harm—from fentanyl-laced drugs bought on Snapchat to suicide after sextortion that began on their platform.\n\nThe quotations we give below indicate that the harms that occur on Snapchat (as with TikTok and Instagram) are so vast that even a highly dedicated trust and safety team that removes hundreds of millions of pieces of harmful content cannot prevent millions of children from being exposed to serious harms on their platform. This is why design changes are so urgently needed. Better content moderation is not enough.\n\nHere’s a simple way to determine whether an online platform is safe for kids: Does it connect children to anonymous unverified adult strangers? If so, then a great variety of harms are likely to ensue, and parents should be wary of letting their children use that platform until the company makes very substantial design changes.\n\nShare\n\n2. What We Have From Snap\n\nWe draw primarily from Attorney General Raul Torrez of New Mexico who released a 165 page narrowly redacted complaint against Snap Inc. on October 2, 2024. We also draw on internal evidence from The State of Nevada’s Complaint by Attorney General Ford and Co., as well as the civil action second amended complaint, Neville et al. v. Snap.\n\nWe have created an annotated version of each of the three briefs (New Mexico, Nevada, and Neville et al.) so that you can see each selection we chose in the context of the rest of the brief.\n\nThere are also a variety of smaller individual and class action lawsuits which address how specific features of Snapchat caused specific harms on individual minor users. Though we do not rely on these for internal quotes from the companies, they offer testimonies of families who have been harmed by the platform.\n\nIn the rest of this post, we organize the evidence of harm that is currently available to us, taken directly from employees and leaders within Snap Inc. and from reports that they commissioned.\n\nLeave a comment\n\n3.

Snap P. 117-124, PARA 481-517: Jack McCarthy got his first phone at 12 years old, and opened a Snapchat account without his parents’ knowledge or consent. Jack’s use of Snapchat “coincided with a steady decline in his mental health.” Jack became “locked into Snap’s social media product, as intended, causing him to feel like he couldn’t sleep without it.” When his parents tried to limit his access to Snapchat, Jack “became agitated… He would become visibly panicked and irrational, willing to do and say anything to get his device back.” Although Jack’s sleep and anxiety worsened, he would claim his “insomnia” would be made worse if his phone was not at his side. After years of Jack’s declining mental health and increasing dependence on the Snap platform, Jack obtained drugs through an anonymous dealer on Snapchat who had added him through Snap’s Quick Add and mapping features. Jack was found dead on his family’s kitchen floor on the morning of September 25, 2021.\n\nOn March 22nd, 2025 we corresponded with Jack’s mother via email. She explained that “Jack died from fentanyl poisoning not an overdose. Jack took one pill which unbeknownst to him contained fentanyl… Enough fentanyl to kill four people. Jack never stood a chance.”\n\n(March 16, 2002 - September 25, 2021)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\n\nInternal Evidence\n\nNew Mexico (NM)\n\nNM P. 111, PARA 273 In January 2017, an internal email titled, “Snap streak distribution first look” highlighted several comments from Snap employees concerning Snapstreaks: “Wow, we should add more addicting features like this.” “Think it would be interesting to investigate how healthy Snapstreak sessions are for users… If I open Snapchat, take a photo of the ceiling to keep my streak going and don’t engage with the rest of the app, is that the type of behavior we want to encourage? Alternatively, if we find that streaks are addictive or a gateway to already deep engagement with other parts of Snapchat, then it would be something positive for “healthy” long term retention and engagement with the product.” “70% of our DAU visit the app everyday, but only 22% have streaks going.” “Most streakers are our core demographic.” “We should answer at the highest level, whether streaks are a by-product of high engagement or a driver of it. My hunch is that it starts off being the former, but eventually becomes the latter - and we should figure out when that magical transition point occurs.”\n\nNM P. 112, PARA 276 A December 2018 presentation titled “Understanding the Consumer and Snapchat Discover” outlined findings from online surveys and focus groups. The summary noted, “Streaks have become pressure filled…” and included data on users’ fear of missing out (FOMO): “As the true digital natives, Gen Zs see their mobile devices as an extension of themselves, and while this allows constant access, it also creates constant pressure. There is never a break from the very real FOMO that exists.” “Respondents in groups and via social media diaries expressed that if they’re not constantly checking social media they felt they were “missing” things (content, communications from friends, news, etc.).” “45% of Snapchat Users 13-17 use Snapchat “almost constantly” “41% of Snapchat Users 13-17 use Youtube “almost constantly” “34% of Snapchat Users 13-17 use Instagram “almost constantly”\n\n\n\nNM P. 113, PARA 278: In October 2019, a presentation acknowledged that “Streaks make it impossible to unplug for even a day” and that “Maintaining Streaks and keeping up with conversations… causes pressure,” which, heightened by notifications, can be stressful: (Fig. 42)\n\nNevada (NV)\n\nNV P. 24, PARA 63 Disruptive use of Snapchat in the classroom was no surprise to Defendants. In the first post on Snapchat’s website, Defendants stated it was “thrilled” with the disruptions: “[t]o get a better sense of how people were using Snapchat and what we could do to make it better, we reached out to some of our users. We were thrilled to hear that most of them were high school students who were using Snapchat as a new way to pass notes in class—behind-the-back photos of teachers and funny faces were sent back and forth throughout the day ” [[You can still find this quotation on Snap’s website. The quotation continues like this: “Server data supported this and we saw peaks of activity during the school day and dips on the weekends.”]]\n\nNV P. 51-52, PARA 157 As one example, in 2018, Defendants conducted internal research on SnapStreaks, which found that over a third of its users reported that keeping a Snap Streak alive was “ extremely ” or “ very important ,” and users further reported that the stress level they experience in keeping Streaks alive was “ large ” and even “ intolerable. ”\n\nNV P. 52, PARA 158 Similarly, additional internal research demonstrates that Snapchat users are more compulsive in their use of the platform, engaging with it “ right when I wake up,” “before work/school,” “during work/school,” “after work/school,” “on vacations,” and “when I’m with others[.]”\n\n\n\nHarm Cluster 2: Drugs and Guns\n\n[[According to the briefs, there is widespread exposure to violent and drug-related content on Snap. This content is often viewed via ‘Spotlight’ and ‘Discover’, and is exacerbated by features such as ‘Quick-Add’.]]\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\n\nReal life example: The following facts are alleged in the public complaint Neville v. Snap P. 80-86, PARA 299-322: It is believed that Alexander Neville started “using Snapchat sometime just prior to starting 8th grade.”\n\n“As a proximate result of Snap’s products and features, i.e. push notifications, user recommendations, interface and operational extended use designs, rewards and gamification features, etc.– Alexander began suffering from severe mental health harms, including, but not limited to, social media compulsion, sleep deprivation, increased anxiety, and depression.”\n\n“Snap also began directing and recommending drug advertisements to Alexander and connecting him to Snapchat Drug Dealers via its recommendations and mapping and location features.”\n\n“[H]e received multiple Quick Add requests… Among the strangers to whom Snap connected Alexander were nearby Snapchat dealers –persons Alex did not know in real life.”\n\nAn anonymous dealer, “AJ Smokxy” sold Alex a pill that was “100% fentanyl.” Alex Neville was pronounced dead from fentanyl poisoning via that pill on the morning of June 23, 2020 at 14 years old.\n\n“AJ Smokxy’s account remained active for roughly a year after Alexander’s death…”\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\n\nInternal Evidence\n\n2.1 Drug Exposure and Sales\n\nNew Mexico (NM)\n\nNM P. 93-95, PARA 227-230 PARA 227: Internal documents show that Snap was aware that its platform was being used to market and sell illicit drugs. After an October 2019 news article described Snapchat's popularity with drug dealers, Snap’s Communications Director complained internally that while the company was “ pushing back fiercely on the claim that illegal content was particularly bad on Snapchat… from what we can see, drug dealing—both buying and selling– has increased significantly.” She noted that dealers use Stories, which are recommended through Snap’s Discovery feed or set to allow communication with “Everyone” to “amass a huge amount of subscribers” with a “lack of repercussions” . While an account may be deleted if it is reported, “ it is not necessarily device blocked, meaning accounts pop right back up. Nor is there any threat to the account being reported by law enforcement,” which complains about the “difficulty of apprehending bad actors on our platform.” PARA 228: Indeed, later that year, meeting notes confirm Snap's recognition that “ some bad actors prefer to transact on Snapchat given the ephemerality of communications on our platform. ” PARA 229: Snap employees also circulated media reports that dealers were finding buyers through its Quick Add feature and that, “per our analysis, on average at least ~700k Snapchatters are exposed to drug content daily in the areas we scanned.” A presentation by the security firm Crisp advised Snap, in a slide headed “Enabling Easy Access to Illegal Substances,” that: “It takes under a minute to use Snapchat to be in position to purchase illegal and harmful substances.” Still in 2022, another firm warned that Snap's features promoted the sale of drugs, warning that not only does Quick Add connect buyers and sellers of drugs, but that Snap's algorithm then “suggests users with similar names and profile types” and that “[a]rtificial intelligence is trained to link these similar accounts together” and that “adding drug or porn accounts leads to more suggested drug and porn accounts.” PARA 230: In June 2020, Snap received a list of concerns from the Daniel Spargo-Mabbs (DSM) Foundation, a drug and alcohol education charity, regarding the availability of drugs on Snapchat. DSM noted, “It is far too easy to find accounts openly selling illegal drugs on Snapchat.” They further stated, “Snapchat is over-reliant on users reporting drug-related content, despite recognizing low levels of reporting by users.” In preparation for an August 2020 meeting with the founder of DSM to address concerns raised about drug dealing on Snapchat, an internal memo laid out Snap's approach to the meeting and draft responses. In part, Snap noted, “We apply different steps against illegal activity to different elements of the platform, some of which we do not publicize to prevent circumvention of those steps. The public side of Snapchat - our Discover platform - is curated and pre-moderated, which prevents opportunity for this kind of activity. When it comes to users' private communications - their Snaps, Chats and Stories - users do have a justifiable expectation that these aren't being monitored or scanned (just as is the case with iMessage, SMS, Whatsapp or private phone calls), and that's not something that we do. So we do rely on user reporting to alert us to illegal activity in this area....”\n\nNM P. 95, PARA 232 In response to rampant drug trafficking on its platform, in 2021 Snap built Abacus, a ‘more proactive’ detection and enforcement model. An internal document noted, “ Since we started in May, we have reviewed 1.5 million pieces of content for drugs, deleted a million of those and deleted half a million-drug sale related accounts. These dealers had previously gone undetected, and it is 35 times the number of dealers reported by end users.’ ‘Based on our current detection we see an average of about half a million unique users being exposed to drug related content every day… ”\n\nNM P. 100-101, PARA 241-242 PARA 241: According to an undated internal Snap presentation regarding a new safety measure, Snap acknowledged that it had a “ problem ” with drugs and guns on the platform. PARA 242: The Snap presenter turned first to drugs, highlighting news articles and a tweet on his wife's feed conveying the ease with which a user could sell cocaine that had “almost a half million likes.” The presenter's notes explained that dealers are using Snapchat's “sharing mechanisms’ ‘to reach teens on Snapchat they would never encounter in real life’ and that ‘some teens have even died as [sic] result of buying drugs that they found through Snapchat. ”\n\n\n\nNeville v. SNAP (NvS)\n\nNvS P. 48, PARA 172 Snap’s own disclosures further establish that Snap only enforces on a small fraction of reported drug activity, while continuously representing that Snap is taking all necessary action to protect minors on Snapchat. 65 FOOTER 65: (reporting that Snap enforced on 270,810 of the 775,145 drug related reports it received during this recent six-month period) [[Snap Inc, Transparency Report January 1, 2022–June 30, 2022]]\n\nNvS P. 54, PARA 195 Current and long-standing member of Snap Safety Advisory Board, Ed Ternan, also claims to have put Snap on explicit notice of what was happening on its platform in February or March of 2021 at the latest, And we said to them, “ you have a problem. What you don’t understand is that the pills being sold on your platform, they’re fake,” and their reaction was “what do you mean? ” “ Well, the Percs that are being advertised on Snapchat are not Percocet, that’s one thing. These are counterfeits made of fentanyl. You need to red flag this problem. You need to make this like child sex trafficking. This is child endangerment. You need to up your game. ”\n\nNvS P. 198, PARA 941 On more than one occasion, Snap itself told parents–behind closed doors and in writing–that it was aware of the fact that its young users “ in fact much of society, remain frighteningly unaware of the opioid crisis and the deadly risks posed by counterfeit pills. ”\n\n\n\n2.2 Gun Exposure and Sales\n\n[[According to the briefs, Snapchat has served as a market for illegal gun sales, connecting buyers to sellers through their search bar, Quick Add, algorithmic feeds, and Snap Map features.]]\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\n\nReal life example: The following facts are alleged in the public complaint NM P. 100, PARA 239: “One New Mexico case demonstrates Snapchat’s use for gun-related crimes. Fourteen-year-old Ahmed Lateef and 15-year-old Collin Romero of Albuquerque were killed in 2018. The 22-caliber gun and bullets through [sic] Snapchat. Limited Snaps provided to law enforcement suggests that the victims met the seller through Snapchat. The three perpetrators, now serving life sentences, also recorded and saved on Snapchat’s Memories videos of beating their victims as they drove across Albuquerque. Snap did not report the activity to law enforcement at the time.” (P. 100, PARA 239).\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\n\nNew Mexico (NM)\n\nNM P. 101-103, PARA 243-244 PARA 243: Turning next to guns, the employee continued down the Twitter thread to a user who responded with the image (Fig. 38) of gun he found for sale on Snapchat minutes before: The presenter notes to the slide (Fig. 39) explained, “ [t]hese are not BB guns or hunting rifles, they are firearms and assault rifles” and “not registered, and they're often implicated in gang violence and murders[.] ” Snap relayed that there were 50 posts related to illegal gun sales per day and 9,000 views per day of these marketed weapons. The presentation also acknowledged that “ [m]ost bad content is not reported on Snapchat” and that even “[r]eported content is usually viewed hundreds of times before report. ” PARA 244: In response to a June 2022 Washington Post article titled, ‘Facebook's ban on gun sales gives sellers 10 strikes before booting them,’ Snap revisited its strike policy on weapons. One Snap executive noted, “ Our strike system isn't yet activated at this point, and the silver lining there is that our draft approach can be adjusted without creating any operational headaches. For consistency across our enforcement framework, my bias is for launching the strike system with three consistent tiers - zero tolerance; 3-strike violations; and 5-strike violations - so here, we'd be contemplating moving weapons into the zero-tolerance tier. I'm very sensitive to the risks of weapon sales on our platform and I'm open to stricter prohibition. But I also appreciate our platform's primary use case is very different from TikTok's - enforcement of this prohibition on Snapchat would, for example, implicate user privacy[[ [[sic]] expectations in ways that I wouldn't expect to be applicable at TikTok. ”\n\n\n\nShare\n\nHarm Cluster 3: Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Sextortion, and In-Person Sexual Predation and Assault\n\n[[According to the briefs, Snap employees have been aware of rampant cases of sextortion, child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and predatory behavior taking place on their platform through features such as ‘Quick Add’, ‘Snap Map’ and ‘My Eyes Only.’ ]]\n\n3.1 Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.

Part four highlights specific ways predators use Snapchat]]\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\n\nInternal Evidence\n\nNew Mexico (NM)\n\nNM P. 51-52, PARA 108-110 PARA 108: In November 2021, Snap circulated an external report that identified specific types of harm on Snapchat with examples. These harms included: facilitating sexual exploitation and grooming of children; child predator “capping” (the capture of a webcam conversation with a child, usually with the aim of getting them to perform sexual acts or undress); bad actor advice and requests to evade Snapchat safety measures; sale of CSAM; allowing users to share and trade CSAM; known predators directing minors to Snapchat; human exploitation and prostitution. PARA 109: For example, numerous Snapchats included details of predators finding minors as young as 8-years-old through Snapchat or obtaining or selling CSAM: (Fig. 28 [[text transcribed below]])\n\n\n\nTEXT FROM FIG 28: “Ffrancious69: 13 year old punk girl i found on snapchat, up for chatting and more!” “So guys last night I was on Snapchat when I saw Lucas train post he was horny. Sadly as much as I tried I couldn’t convince him to show me his dick but we had an interesting conversation. Obviously we talked about his journey as a TBM model and he had a lot of fun shooting and dancing for the photographer. He said that not only did he do nudes but there is footage of him doing stuff with the photographers son. I would assume this means that there is footage filmed on Snapchat of him and Xavier, he said that you can buy the[m] via DM on Snapchat and this gives me hope.” “Freddy666 (@f666cosmo): Hi @yeraltin I have regularly talked to an 11YO boy on a cam chat his cam freezes but he was so cute to let go and I was about to get to the good parts so I add him on Snapchat with my friends fake snap. And yes I did see what I wanted he did see my girl so far so good. Now he keeps typing to me he don’t want to see more or don’t ask for it, I keep putting him off as kind I can but he told me he don’t have any friends which broke my heart and I just can’t delete him.” “DtravisBick287: Hey guys, I am chatting with this incredibly handsome and hot boy on snapchat and he has a dropbox that he sells. He won’t give it to me for free and I cannot afford it right now. Anyone know a way I can get hold of his content. He has solo videos and photos with his brother as well.” (Snapchat) my 8yo boyfriend 16 Videos / 52 photos: https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.com thanks”\n\n\n\nPARA 110: Snap complained that requirements to identify grooming would be too invasive of user privacy, an especially problematic position, given Snap’s age verification failures, and “would create disproportionate admin costs.” Snap also created a view that “[i]t shouldn’t be a private operator's responsibility to determine what constitutes grooming.”\n\nNM P. 50, PARA 105-106 PARA 105: In one internal exchange, Evan Spiegel rejected a suggestion that Snap retain images it categorized as abuse, which would enhance the platform's credibility in administering its rules, shifting the burden to young users to capture and report the content. In comments, Spiegel wrote, “Yeah, except we don’t want to be responsible for storing that stuff. Better if they screenshot and email ghostbusters to report.”\n\n\n\n3.2 Sextortion\n\nNew Mexico (NM)\n\nNM P. 3-4, PARA 6 PARA 6: Adult strangers can then take advantage of Snap’s algorithm, its appearance of safety and impermanence, and features like Snap Map, which allows them to find and meet these children in the real world. For years, Snap has been on notice from both external and internal sources of the dangers its platform presents for children but has nonetheless failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material, sexual propositions, and dangerous drugs delivered to children.\n\nNM P. 4, PARA 8 Instead of implementing additional safeguards to address the unique susceptibility of Snapchat, Snap has done the opposite. While recognizing the need to ensure that “user reports related to grooming and sextortion are not continuing to fall through the cracks” and that “no action is taken by agents” in instances where users report “being sextorted or asked for nudes (which we know is often the start of sextortion),” Snap also complained internally that identifying and protecting minors from sexually explicit content and predatory users would overburden its moderators, “create disproportionate admin costs” and should not be its responsibility. Snap employees pointed to a “case where an account had 75 different reports against it in Oct ‘21, mentioning nudes, minors and extortion, yet the account was still active.”\n\nNM P. 7, PARA 15 Former Snap trust and safety employees complained that “they had little contact with upper management, compared to their work at other social media companies, and that there was pushback in trying to add in-app safety mechanisms because [Snap CEO] Evan Spiegel prioritized design.”\n\nNM P. 53-54, PARA 115-118 PARA 115: Nearly a year later, in March 2023, Snap noted another “gap” in addressing sextortion on the platform. In addition to finding that many sextortion reports are “typically not associated with violating media, and therefore, were not actionable under existing policies,” an internal chat noted that “an investigation of confirmed sextortion cases involving nine distinct bad actors and 279 victims concluded that 70% of victims didn’t report their victimizations (and of the 30% that did report, there was no enforcement action by our team for the reasons noted above).” PARA 116: Snap employees also complained about being understaffed to appropriately handle trust and safety functions. PARA 117: That same month [after an investigation revealing the volume of sextortion on the platform], another Snap internal thread flagged that the platform was “ leaving a lot on the table with CSAM sales ” and advocated applying a rule that would address “thousands” of child pornography Dropbox accounts. When told that the proposed solution would have to be evaluated by “legal and privacy” and discussed at the next group meeting, the employee questioned, “I would think our legal obligations to remove CSAM from our platform at least somewhat mitigates the burden of legal review for a Rapid Rule with a very high enforcement rate.” Later that day, on the same communication channel, Snap’s director of security engineering addressed a fix to address Android users who are selling drugs or CSAM on Snap: “that’s fine it’s been broken for ten years we can tolerate tonight.” With regard to sextortion on the platform, one employee had complained in a private channel: “God I’m so pissed that were [sic] over-run by this sextortion shit right now. We’ve twiddled our thumbs and wrung our hands all f…ing year. [...] My concern is not really the ‘what’ [[publicity on Snap’s lack of action on sextortion cases]] but the ‘when.’” [[In Snap’s motion to dismiss, they respond to parts of Para 117 stating: “The State also claims, for instance, that Snap lacks “urgency and commitment to addressing CSAM” because employees discussed that a “proposed solution” to CSAM “would have to be evaluated by ‘legal and privacy.’” (Id. ¶ 117.) However, the State omits that in the same communication, employees expressed confidence such review would be “simple and swift” because combatting CSAM is a “#1” priority for Snap. Contrary to the State’s insinuations, Snap’s employees act exactly as a responsible corporation should when faced with these issues—i.e., they work together to prioritize the safety and wellbeing of the Snapchat community and address potential criminal activity.]] PARA 118: As laid out above and below, Snapchat’s dangerous design features and platform management decisions, including, but not limited to, its algorithm, have made and continue to make it easy for predators to find, connect with, and harm young victims. Some of these features include ephemeral or “disappearing” Snaps, Quick Add, and Snapmap.\n\nNM P. 56, PARA 123 The FTC said Snapchat had also failed to put up basic safeguards, such as verifying users’ phone numbers. Some users had ended up sending “personal snaps to complete strangers”... A Snapchat representative admitted that “while we were focused on building, some things didn’t get the attention they could have.”\n\nNM P. 75, PARA 182 NCOSE [ National Center on Sexual Exploitation ] stated in part, “It is vital that Snapchat takes a more proactive approach to websites or online personalities funneling audiences toward Snapchat for sexually exploitative purposes. This is especially true, given Snapchat’s own admission on July 17, 2019, where they noted, “We are concerned predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms.”\n\nNM P. 78, PARA 191 Snap assures parents that the company “ ban[s] public profiles for minors and friend lists are private. ” Yet, Snap fails to tell parents that unknown adults can still contact their children through private chat requests, which creates a false sense of safety. Snap compounds this failure by filtering the communications available to parents; in Snap’s Family Center “Parents can only see who their kids sent a message to - not who has sent a message to their teen.”\n\n\n\nNM P. 52-53, PARA 111-114 PARA 111: Snap employees on an internal Slack chat regarding trust and safety goals in January 2022 discussed the fact that “by design, over 90% of account level reports are ignored today and instead we just prompt one person to block the other person.” PARA 112: Yet even these reports were often ignored. In August 2022, a Snap employee raised concerns about the need to take steps to ensure that user reports of grooming and sextortion were not “continuing to fall through the cracks,” making clear that Snap was aware of the ongoing problem and its failure to adequately address even the dangerous, violating conduct brought to its attention: “I am surfacing this thread regarding the guidance previously provided to our vendor agents with the hopes of better understanding the existing guidance so that we can determine how we might need to expand it to ensure that user reports related to grooming and sextortion are not continuing to fall through the cracks. This afternoon [we] discovered that a quick search for the term “nudes” in OhSnap comments surfaces a number of tasks that entered the Account Reporting - Impersonation queue… in which the users’ reports detail the user being sextorted or asked for nudes (which is often the start of sextortion), but no action is taken by the agents. While we’ll need to be mindful of how our guidance to the vendor agents influences the flow of escalations to FTEs, I do think we should revisit this to make sure we are being adequately strategic and responsive to our users’ reports.” PARA 113: Others agreed and commented: “I think want [sic] to add criteria for escalating suspicious accounts, but also don’t want to overwhelm FTE Specialists” “I’m glad you raised this, as it’s something I wanted to talk to you about after reviewing a big chunk of the 350 names sent to us by NCMEC last week, most of which were sextortion accounts.” “...current guidance meant that vendors were not raising these for further review, so I’m sure this is something we should address straight away.” PARA 114: Snap failed to disclose this security failure to its young users and parents.\n\nNM P. 59-60, PARA 132-134 PARA 132: Indeed Snap was well aware–and failed to inform users, parents and the public–that sextortion was a rampant, “ massive” and “ incredibly concerning issue” on Snapchat. In a November 2022 internal email trying to confirm data queries, a T&S [Trust and Safety] team member stated, “ They indicate that we are getting around 10,000 user reports of sextortion each month. If this is correct, we have an incredibly concerning issue on our hands, in my humble opinion. It seems to me that having an accurate understanding of the magnitude of this issue is extremely important given the psychological impact of sextoriton [sic] on victims, especially when those victims are minors.” PARA 133: A T&S Investigations employee replied: “I think our teams understand this is a huge problem. Curious if Exec is aware just how massive and impactful the scale of the issue is. Worth noting that 10k monthly reports likely represents a small fraction of this abuse as this is an embarrassing issue that is not easy to categorize in reporting.” PARA 134: A December 2022 draft Snap Marketing Brief titled “ Sexting and Sextortion, ” recognized that adults were targeting minors for “ deeply pernicious and dangerous ” conduct on the platform but did not want to “ strik[e] fear ” among its young users: In the eyes of many, Snapchat is associated with “sexting” - and believe it’s what the app was designed for. It is undeniable that over the last 10 years, “sexting” or sending of nudes has become common behavior across many age demographics. Sexting has become a “regular behavior” amongst Generation Z, and we know it happens on Snapchat. In many (though by no means all) cases, sending what seems like run-of-the-mill sexual content can lead to disproportionate consequences and severe harms. We believe that one of the upstream issues for many (but not all) of these harms involves young people being friended by individuals that they don’t know in real life and furthermore being able to recognize demands for sexual content, the performance of sexual acts and other suspicious activity that can lead to sexting/sextortion cases. Reporting violating content or concerning contact with/behavior by strangers is a key action that teens/Snapchatters can take when confronted with these situations. As a platform that has significant reach and engagement with the Gen-Z community, we recognize our responsibility to ensure teens are educated and informed about the potential consequences of some of the behaviors that currently feel very normalized. We are keen to avoid a finger-wagging tone and want the key messages to be shared in an informative and non-judgemental way. We can’t tell our audience NOT to send nudes; this approach is likely futile, “tone deaf” and unrealistic. That said, we also can’t say, ‘If you DO do it: (1) don’t have your face in the photo, (2) don’t have tattoos, piercings or other defining physical characteristics in view, etc.’ Bottom line: We cannot be seen as aiding and abetting the production of (at a minimum) child sexually exploitative material. We need to run through a very thoughtful messaging & visual storytelling exercise/session on how to best balance education without striking fear into Snapchatters. (emphasis added) [[The original quote bolds “without striking fear into Snapchatters”]]\n\nNM P. 70, PARA 167 Additionally Snap’s internal documents also contain a “ Sextortion handbook” which shows how to use Snap Maps to target a school where they can, “tap on the screen to view any snap stories that might have been shared by students who share snap stories with the ‘snap maps’ options enabled.” [[This is referencing a “sextortion handbook” that was developed by sexual predators for sextorting minors using Snapchat.]]\n\nNM P. 50-51, PARA 107. Snap continued to discuss–internally–evidence of ongoing child sexual exploitation on its platform. An internal email dated June 7, 2021, noted “ Flagging this piece looking at the % of child sexual assaults that were facilitated by technology. Between 2007-2013 FB was the highest, then dating apps until 2017, after which Snapchat is recorded as the most used platform. ” The attached article, “Jump in sexual assaults of children groomed online,” called out the prevalence of child sexual abuse on Snapchat stating, “They found a big upswing since 2015 in perpetrators using social media platforms, especially Snapchat and dating sites, to communicate with children aged between 12 and 17 before meeting and assaulting them.” The article continued, “In the early years of the study, between 2007 and 2013, three-quarters of offenders had used Facebook to communicate with child victims, but between 2014-2016 dating apps, many that children should be too young to access, started to feature. Between 2017 and 2020, Snapchat had been the platform employed by nearly half of offenders.” [[You can find this article here.]]\n\nNM P. 62, PARA 142 In May 2021, Snap employees discussed this ongoing problem in an internal email titled “Responsible growth initiative,” stating, “We need to come up with new approaches that ringfence our most vulnerable users (minors) and make it hard for predatory users to find them via quick add, search, etc. We believe we can achieve this without meaningfully degrading the product experience for these users if we pursue new strategies in inventory generation/constraints and other techniques to more effectively silo minors from people outside their networks. This is probably the most important long-term thing we need to work on…” One employee continued, “ I wish we had more metrics to frame these clearly. What does success look like if we make progress here - obviously large-scale friending spam numbers goes down but what about low-grade “creep” attacks. How does proactively playing D here help us unlock more growth?” As this email indicates, the choice to address features that introduced minors to predators was harnessed to, and would only be pursued to service of, Snapchat's growth.\n\nNM P. 65-67, PARA 149-155 PARA 149: Thus, a February 2022 PowerPoint prepared by Snap's consultant reported that “ many young people reported being added by bots on Snapchat. This seemed to be particularly pervasive issue through 'Quick Add' feature as people described being added and receiving unsolicited messages from unknown senders. ” PARA 150: It was clear to Snap that allowing minors to be recommended to users with two friends in common failed to provide meaningful protection to children. A May 2023 internal email described results from a quality assurance test session to “ pressure test the friending, chat, and registration experience for minors. ” The findings included: “Minors may receive a ton of random Quick Add suggestions: In tests where someone registered as a minor with their “Contact Book” sync off, they received random Quick Add suggestions once they added 1 – 2 friends. Alternatively, if you add multiple 18+ accounts, a lot of your Quick Add suggestions are adults... Minors can communicate with adults they are not friends with through group chats: There are a number of ways minors (or anyone) can be added to group chats without being friends with people who could abuse them. [[redacted text]] These are difficult features to solve for, but we may want to consider exploring additional safeguards for minors as they pertain to group messages and invite links (e.g. callouts that they are joining a group with people they may not know/aren't friends with; warning when clicking invite links; etc).” PARA 151: Thus, Snap recognized that restricting Quick Add to friends of friends still exposed minors to introductions to adult strangers. If one or more minors in a network fall victim to an adult groomer, that pedophile can contact everyone in that network. PARA 152: Snap acknowledged internally that “Bad actors” would groom 2-3 friends on other platforms, such as gaming platforms, in order to jumpstart the algorithm to suggest additional minor friends. PARA 153: Consistent with Snap's own findings, the 2023 Federal Human Trafficking Report noted that Snapchat was one of the “Top Platforms used in the recruitment of Victims 2019-2023.” PARA 154: On January 31, 2024, Snap published the written Congressional testimony of Evan Spiegel on its Safety Blog, quoting his statement that: “ Snapchat's default “Contact Me ” settings are set to friends and phone contacts only for all accounts, and can't be expanded.” [Quote by Spiegel] “ We want Snapchat to be safe for everyone, and we offer extra protections for minors to help prevent unwanted contact and provide an age-appropriate experience. Snapchat's default “Contact Me” settings are set to friends and phone contacts only for all accounts, and can't be expanded. If a minor receives a friend request from someone they don't share a mutual friend with, we provide a warning before they start communicating to make sure it is someone they know. As a result, approximately 90% of friend requests received by minors on Snapchat are from someone with at least one mutual friend in common. Our goal is to make it as difficult as possible for people to be contacted by someone they don't already know. ”\n\nHowever, an internal survey conducted by Snap's Product Research team in August of 2022 indicated that Snap users of all age brackets can toggle their “Contact Me” settings to “Everyone.” In addition, the survey showed that a large number of users who had “Everyone” enabled to contact them were under the impression that “Everyone” only applied to “Just Friends that I Added” (24.8%), a percentage that was highest for users in the youngest age brackets (13-17 and 18-24).\n\nPARA 155: Additionally, Snap's search term tool allows unknown adults to identify minor accounts. In January 2019, in an internal discussion regarding how to respond to a press inquiry in the United Kingdom, a Snap T&S employee admitted, “I wasn't aware that you were able to use search terms to bring up accounts. Using 'underage' just now there are accounts like 'These Girls R Underage' or 'Underage Nudes' and 'Nude Underage Girls'. I thought that you needed to know an account name in order to be able to search for accounts.” This design defect provides another means for adult predators to find and solicit minors on Snap's platform.\n\nShare\n\n3.3 In-Person Sexual Predation and Assault\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *. Real life example: The following facts are alleged from New Mexico v. Snap, P. 33 PARA 83: An 11-year-old girl was introduced to an anonymous user, under the Snapchat account “‘sugar_daddy4u29” “through Snapchat’s Quick Add feature”. This user (who was a 27-year-old male) “offered her money and she agreed to meet him in person, where, feeling pressure to do something, she performed oral sex on him. The girl continued to communicate with Marquez on Snapchat and arranged to meet him again on several occasions, where he again sexually assaulted her.”\n\nReal life example: The following facts are alleged in the public complaint Nevada v. Snap P. 49, PARA 143: “In another instance, a 25-year-old used Snap Map to hunt down and sexually assault a 16-year-old in Florida. Per a local news report, the man: [U]sed Snapchat to reach out to the girl, then, unbeknownst to the teen, track[ed] her down in real-time using the Snapchat feature called Snap Map. ‘Our victim posted a life story, and then he used Snap Map to track her down because of the meta tags that's [sic] in the photo,’ [a law enforcement official] said. Detectives said the Snap Map allowed the suspect to see the data the teen posted and know just where she posted it from. [‘]If you don’t hide your location where you make that [sic], take that photo or that posting from, they can use data that's hidden in the photo to track you down,’ [the same official] said.”\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\n\nNew Mexico (NM)\n\nNM P. 68-69, PARA 158-164 PARA 158: Snapchat was long aware of the potential safety issues regarding Snap Map from direct user reports. For example, in June 2017, Snap’s T&S Team Leads discussed “ Snap Map Privacy Concerns.” The first report: “2. User wrote in stating the following: 1. I was at a party and a group of older men found us all on snapmap and they tried to come in and threatened to hurt us. We put our bitmojis on ghost but… 2. My account was hacked and the hackers could of seen my location from the snapmap and this makes me extremely worried and concerned I don’t feel this feature is safe and even if you people were told to put themselves on ghost mode, what would the relevance of the feature be then anyway. It’s endangering people.” PARA 159: Snap T&S employees internally voiced disbelief that there was a way “for a group of strange men to find them on Snap Map without being friends,” but responded to the user encouraging her to report any crime to law enforcement. The T&S representative also informed the user about “Only Me (Ghost Mode)”; the feature a user can affirmatively activate to prevent being “visible to anyone else on the Map.” However, they acknowledged, “even with Ghost Mode enabled, if you choose to submit a Snap to Our Story, it may show up on the heat map for Snapchatters to view.” PARA 160: On July 16, 2017, Snap employees circulated an article which included an interview with the Chief Executive of Parent Zone, who warned of the risks to children posed by Snap Map. She noted the connection between Snap Map and fear of missing out (FOMO) and social exclusion—particularly powerful with adolescents—but also noted, “We very rarely say this, but in this instance we are saying ‘This feature is adding nothing to your life and it's a threat to your security, so turn it off.’” [[You can find this article here.]] PARA 161: In the same article, a television show panelist noted the danger of “strangers or online acquaintances [users] have never met in real life” being able to see children's exact location. The article reported that police used a decoy account to “pinpoint where videos of an 18-month-old toddler, a two-year-old girl and teenagers drinking alcohol at parties had been made.” PARA 162: In a November 2020 internal document, Snap acknowledged that “ Previously public content (e.g., posts to the Map) could generate 'Friend Requests' from illegitimate friends (people who the account holder did not know and may not have wanted to be connected with). ” Thus, Snap Map might not only disclose a user's current location but allow followers to stay in touch with that user. PARA 163: In September 2022, Snap employees proposed additional safety controls for Snap Map and acknowledged that it was making young users even more vulnerable to predators, including from friend requests from strangers: “My only suggestion is we consider you ACCEPT a friend request from someone who appears outside your normal friend graph (e.g., - no friends in common). A lot of the predatory/abusive friending that leads to real world harms will typically happen on an inbound basis rather than an outbound basis, i.e., usually the predator is trying to add a lot of kids, rather than the other way around.” PARA 164: Snap employees agreed, stating, “ Underaged users become even more vulnerable if the predators make friends with them and see their trail on the map. ”\n\nNM P. 70, PARA 165-167 PARA 165: On June 25, 2024, Snap stated that “ Snapchatters can only ever share their whereabouts with their existing Snapchat friends — there is no option to broadcast their location to the wider Snapchat community.” PARA 166: However, an internal custodial document titled, “ Snap Safety and Privacy Principles for Minors (13-15-year-olds), ” stated that “ geofilters” were considered a “residual risk” in terms of “expos[ing] precise location of minors beyond their opted-in friends. ”\n\nNM P. 75, PARA 183 Despite its public statement regarding its commitment to privacy, Snap knows that its privacy settings are frequently misleading, especially to young users. A survey by its [[Snap’s]] Product Research team revealed that one-quarter of users thought that “enabling ‘Everyone’ to contact them applies only to ‘Just My Friends that I added’....”\n\n\n\nHarm 4: Cyberbullying\n\n[[According to the briefs, the company is aware of cyberbullying on their platform that is exacerbated by specific design features, including its anonymity and the app’s ephemeral nature seen in disappearing photos and messages. Between 2019-2021, Snap enabled third-party Apps such as YOLO and LMK on their platform. These apps were often used by teens to post anonymous polls and Q&A’s. Note that Snap did remove such apps from their platform after the Carson v. Snap litigation.]]\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\n\nReal life example: The following facts are alleged in the public complaint Bride v. Snap Inc. P. 18-21, PARA 66-85, P. 2 PARA 6, P. 23 PARA 89, P. 52 PARA 209: Carson Bride was 16 when he took his own life by hanging himself at his home on the morning of June 23, 2020.\n\n(November 27, 2003 - June 23, 2020)\n\n“On or about July 4, 2020, it was revealed that Carson had been bullied on Defendants’ apps Snapchat, YOLO and LMK prior to his suicide. After Carson ended his life, two psychologists who provided care to Carson and his family opined that Carson’s suicide was triggered by cyberbullying.”\n\n“Upon information and belief, from January 23, 2020 to June 22, 2020, Carson received 105 messages via YOLO… of the 105 anonymous messages Carson received via YOLO, 62 messages included content that was meant to humiliate him, often involving sexually explicit and disturbing content.”\n\nThrough Carson’s internet search history, investigators concluded that Carson made multiple attempts to reveal the identities of the bullies. “Carson relied on YOLO’s misrepresentations that it would reveal the identities of aggressors” on their platform. Snap also failed to deliver on its statements that “it would remove any third party apps that allow bullying and harassing behavior on its platform.”\n\n“On the first screen of the user’s interface with the app, YOLO states, ‘No bullying. If you send harassing messages to our users, your identity will be revealed.’” The lack of follow through on this statement is seen in Carson's internet search history of items such as “YOLO Identity Reveal”, and multiple in-app attempts to have abusers “‘S/U’ (Swipe Up) to reveal their identities”, with no results. And as further evidenced in Carson’s final attempt to find out who was sending abusive YOLO messages to him, on the morning of his suicide, Carson’s final phone search was “Reveal YOLO Username Online.”\n\n[[You can read an essay from Carson’s mother, Kristin, about her story and her experience dealing with Snap Inc. here.]]\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.\n\nInternal Evidence\n\nNew Mexico (NM)\n\nNM P. 60-61, PARA 136 Snap's own research demonstrated that ephemerality was directly connected to parental concerns about the safety of their children. In the July 2023 Snap Parent Perceptions Research, it noted, “ Core Snap features – specifically ephemerality, location sharing, and streaks – are directly connected to specific parental concerns like bullying, inappropriate contact with either peers or strangers, and mental health.” In the study, parents' views on Snap's ephemeral messaging were highlighted: “Ephemeral messaging is what parents most strongly associate Snapchat with, and in turn, this feature creates the most concern for them “Ephemerality exacerbates parents’ worries about their inability to properly supervise their teens’ communication with friends, or even strangers. “Parents also believe this aspect of Snapchat encourages their teens to behave without regard for possible consequences, and enables cyberbullying, contact from strangers, or inappropriate behavior such as the sending or receiving of sexual or explicit messages, images, or videos. “While somewhat more rare, a few parents raised concerns about ephemeral messaging making Snapchat an easier platform on which to conduct the purchase and sale of illegal drugs. Topical concerns about drugs and sextortion were quite rare and infrequent. ”\n\nNM P. 126-127, PARA 317 Given Snapchat's disappearing messages and popularity with minors, the platform serves as a hub for cyberbullying and harassment — with bullies having little to no fear of consequences. In a February 2022 “In-App Reporting Research” deck by Snap's consultant, they found, “ cyberbullying, both anonymous and from known contacts, was a commonly cited problem... Disappearing messages can embolden bullies to harass people with less fear of consequence. ”\n\n\n\nHarm Cluster 5: Underage Use and Lack of Age Verification\n\n[[Snap has an age minimum of 13 for users but has an age verification system that relies on them honestly reporting their own birthday and is easily bypassed.]]\n\nInternal Evidence\n\nNew Mexico (NM)\n\nNM P. 3, PARA 5 Teens and preteens can easily register for unrestricted accounts because Snap lacks any meaningful mechanism to verify their ages - a child-endangering design failure that Snap has known for years. Indeed, in 2022, a Snap executive emailed: “ I don’t think we can say that we actually verify…. ” And Snap’s platform facilitates underage use even though Snap has the capability of both determining that users are minors and providing warnings or other protections against material that is not only harmful to minors but poses substantial dangers of solicitation, trafficking, and other harms.\n\nNM P. 18-19, PARA 61-62 PARA 61: In a March 2022 internal email thread regarding Snap’s response to U.S. & Global age verification legislation, Snap’s Senior Director of Public Policy International responded, “There’s only so many times we can say ‘safety-by-design’ or ‘we’re kind’. Politicians and regulators are looking for tangible, substantive progress/initiatives. I’m not saying we should do that because we’re told to do so, but we should be aware that our current position, having used it for so long, is wearing very thin. Age assurance, in particular, remains a real weakness.”\n\nNM P. 116, PARA 289 “Currently this type of [suggestive] content equates to ~5% Spotlight Story views for 13-17-year-olds globally.”\n\n\n\nNevada (NV)\n\nNV P. 67-68, PARA 202 …Defendants’ executives have admitted that Snapchat’s age verification “ is effectively useless in stopping underage users from signing up to the Snapchat app.” Not surprisingly, underage use is widespread. As of 2021, 13% of children aged 8-12 use Snapchat.\n\nNV P. 68, PARA 203 Snap routinely obtains actual knowledge that its Youngest Users are on Snap’s platforms without parental consent. A UK report from March 2023 supports this proposition. Ahead of Britain’s planned Online Safety Bill, TikTok and Snapchat were asked how many suspected users under the age of 13 they had removed from their platform in a year. TikTok reported that between April 2021 and 2022 it had blocked an average of around 180,000 suspected underage accounts in Britain alone every month (totaling around 2 million, in Britain, for a 12-month period). For this same period of time, “Snapchat had disclosed that it had removed approximately 60 accounts per month, or just over 700 total.” A source within Snapchat acknowledged that “ It makes no sense that Snapchat is blocking a fraction of the number of children that TikTok is. ”\n\n\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nSnapchat has been running an advertising campaign with the theme “Less social media. More Snapchat.” The implication is that Snapchat is not social media, it’s just a way for close friends to keep in contact with each other, similar to texting but with more photos.\n\nImage. Screenshot of Snapchat’s homepage, April 11th, 2025\n\nIf that was truly the way it was used by nearly all of its users, it would not be particularly harmful and there would be no need for this post. But as multiple legal briefs and hundreds of quotations have shown, design choices made long ago and more recently have turned the platform into something that shares a lot with Instagram and TikTok. In addition, Snapchat’s unique combination of quick-add, disappearing messages, Snapmap, and no record of the content of conversations makes Snapchat particularly well suited for ill-intentioned adults who want to interact with or sell things to children.\n\nAs Sarah Wynn-Williams recently said about Meta, “It didn’t have to be this way.” The same is true for Snapchat. As we have suggested in this post, Snap could fix many of these problems quickly if they were to make the platform less addictive to children and less inviting for criminal activity. For example, they could:\n\nWork harder to identify underage users and remove them from the platform. At present, at least several million children in the U.S. alone who are under 13 have Snapchat accounts. Social media companies could age-gate in a variety of ways if they wanted to. Remove the Quick Add feature, which is one of the main ways that adult predators and drug dealers get access to children and teens. Remove the streaks feature, which leads many teens to send photos to each other compulsively, needlessly increasing their time on the app. Remove beauty filters for minors. Remove engagement-based algorithms, at the very least, for minors. Stop deleting posts on Snap’s own servers. The fact that Snap does not store the content of conversations (beyond a limited period) is helpful for drug dealers, sextortionists, and others with criminal intent, but it does not improve the user experience for most children to know that even if something goes terribly wrong, their conversations cannot be discovered by law enforcement officers.\n\nWe understand that it is very difficult to run a platform used by hundreds of millions of people in many countries. But if you operate a platform that is central to the lives of children, including millions of 10-12 year olds, then you have a moral responsibility to make design choices for their benefit, even if those changes reduce engagement and revenue. You can’t just pull more sharks out of the water. You have to put up a shark barrier, no matter the cost.\n\nWe are grateful that Snapchat has been willing to engage with us, and we recognize that their Trust and Safety team is working hard in a difficult and ever-changing environment. We hope to continue our conversation with them, and we hope to write about the platform in the future with news of major improvements.\n\nBut in the meantime, we believe that the quotations we have presented—from Snap’s leaders, employees, and consultants—provides strong evidence for parents and legislators to take action on our second of four norms for rolling back the phone-based childhood: No social media before 16."}

He was 78.\n\nHis wife, Terry Gross, the co-executive producer and host of Fresh Air, confirmed his death to NPR Music. Davis had been under the care of home hospice since last fall, living with emphysema and Parkinson's disease.\n\nDavis held an influential post at The Village Voice, inheriting its main jazz column from Gary Giddins in 2004. Two years later he started a year-end Jazz Critics Poll at the Voice, running it annually there until 2011. Davis later brought this poll to NPR Music, where it resided from 2013 to 2020 ; in the years since, it has had a home at ArtsFuse. Wherever it landed, the Francis Davis Jazz Critics Poll, as it came to be known, always gestured toward a notion of consensus, underscoring his standing as a leader among his peers.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFor decades, Davis was a contributing editor to The Atlantic, defining its coverage of jazz. \"Francis's frame of vision was so broad: He profiled John Zorn and Benny Carter in the same year, and both pieces are equally sharp,\" David A. Graham, a current staff writer at the magazine, tells NPR Music. \"I'm always impressed by how easily he saw through fads — from the 'piousness' of '70s fusion to the backward glance of the Young Lions — while conveying for even casual readers what made the best jazz so great.\"\n\nDuring his long tenure with The Atlantic, Davis did much of the reporting and writing that furnished his essay collections. One of these, Jazz and Its Discontents: A Francis Davis Reader, from 2004, opens with his wry advice about courting book publishers: \"Promise them a concept album and give them your greatest hits.\"\n\nBut Davis stamped each of his books with judicious editorial rigor, along with ample literary flair. In 1990, reviewing his collection Outcats: Jazz Composers, Instrumentalists, and Singers, the Washington Post book critic Jonathan Yardley pegged Davis as \"a sympathetic observer of the complexities of the artistic life,\" adding that \"he is a sensitive, knowledgeable, perceptive, imaginative critic, and even when he's moping he's a pleasure to read.\"\n\nMore than many of his contemporaries, Davis peered beyond the given framework of any musical subject, keen to consider the context, both cultural and commercial. His liner notes for the 2009 Miles Davis reissue Kind of Blue: 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition provide a case in point. \"In terms of where it falls in jazz history, Kind of Blue is celebrated for being the album that popularized improvising on modes — that is, improvising in the sparest and starkest of scales as an alternative to bebop's dense thickets of chord changes,\" Davis wrote. \"But this hardly explains the album's hold on three successive generations of listeners, most of whom probably wouldn't know a mode from a Mercedes Benz.\"\n\nHe won a Grammy award for those album notes. He was also awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1993 and a Pew Fellowship in 1994. He received the ASCAP Deems Taylor Award on numerous occasions, including a special recognition for his 2001 essay collection Like Young: Jazz, Pop, Youth and Middle Age.\n\nFrancis John Davis was born in Philadelphia on Aug. 30, 1946. His mother, the former Dorothy McCartney, worked as a medical clerk; he never knew his father. \"I think of myself as a war baby, in a way,\" he said in a 2001 interview with Joe Maita, for the online magazine Jerry Jazz Musician. \"I grew up in a home where my mother had lost her brother in WWII. I am named after her brother. We had my grandmother in the house as well.\"\n\nAs a teenager, Davis recalled in the same interview, he got a part-time job at a branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia. There he indulged a passion for books, and was struck especially by a 1959 Norman Mailer collection, Advertisements for Myself. \"It was the first time I read anybody who wrote on writing,\" Davis said. \"He would talk about word choices, and how he had changed one word to another. It was also a book that gave a sense of writing as an intensely masculine activity.\"\n\nDavis attended Temple University from 1964 to '69. He was there for saxophonist John Coltrane's performance in '66, released nearly half a century later as Offering: Live at Temple University. \"The walkouts began 15 minutes or so into the evening's first tune,\" Davis later wrote of the concert, a deep plunge into avant-garde expression. \"What was shocking about the exodus was that these were Coltrane addicts presumably undaunted by the turbulence and complexity of his music to that point, but grief-stricken by what they were hearing now.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nHe himself was far from grief-stricken; by the concert's end, he was on his feet cheering. He'd later recall this as one moment that inspired him to become a music critic, though it took a little while. In the meantime, he worked at record stores — including a branch of Listening Booth, on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. He was a manager of that store in the late 1970s, when Terry Gross, an up-and-coming host at WHYY, began stopping in.\n\n\"It was near the radio station, maybe 10 blocks away,\" Gross says of the Listening Booth, where she knew a fellow employee. \"It was easy to walk over when I needed a record. I had a three-hour show five days a week, so I needed to fill time: I needed film critics and art critics and music critics. I asked him if he would consider doing a piece on spec where he would choose an out-of-print jazz recording that no one had access to, and play excerpts of the album and talk about why it mattered — in terms of the musician, the composition, but also in the context of the jazz and popular-culture world. And the script he sent in was so beautifully written. I didn't even know he was a writer. He started doing that regularly, for a weekly series he called Interval.\"\n\nAs they worked together, Gross and Davis formed a friendship that blossomed into something more. \"Our first date, so to speak, was an Abdullah Ibrahim concert in West Philly; I'm pretty sure it was at St. Mary's Church,\" Gross remembers. \"Then we went to hear Jonathan Richman and The Modern Lovers, and then we went to hear Lou Reed. And by then, the deal was sealed.\" Davis and Gross became a couple in 1978. They married in 1996.\n\nDavis covered jazz for the Philadelphia Inquirer from 1978 to 1983. And when Fresh Air with Terry Gross went national in 1987, Davis was its first jazz critic. Within a year, he decided that radio was not his natural medium; for his replacement, he recommended Kevin Whitehead, whose reviews he'd read in Cadence magazine. (Last year, Whitehead stepped down after more than 35 years with the show.) \"It was such a perfect suggestion,\" Gross says of the handoff. \"Kevin also has that kind of hard-boiled sound on air. Francis' sensibility was so shaped by film noir and hard-boiled detective fiction. It all really made sense.\"\n\nDavis' interest in film, literature and popular song resulted in a range of articles outside his jazz purview. His friendship with the legendary film critic Pauline Kael resulted in a book with a self-explanatory title: Afterglow: A Last Conversation With Pauline Kael. (Writing in Salon, Allen Barra described it as \"an important little book that serves as both oral history and memoir.\")"}

The first one is entitled Aging disgracefully, and documents a major increase in promiscuous sex and drug use among the baby boom generation. (Yes, that’s my generation.) The second article notes a dramatic decrease in this sort of behavior among the younger generation:\n\nThe trend towards youthful sobriety holds true for much of the rich world. In 2024 illicit drug use among adolescents dropped to historical lows in America, according to a nationwide survey published on December 17th by the University of Michigan. Drinking fell, too. The researchers found that even cannabis use is now declining fast among the young, despite weed having been made legal in almost half of states over the past decade. European surveys show continuing drops in drug and alcohol use too. Why is youthful excess dying out? There is no single explanation. Children are more closely watched than in the past, and a higher share of young adults are from more abstemious immigrant cultures. Age id checks at bars are more common; Netflix and Fortnite are cheaper than cider; and dating apps are better than finding love on the sticky floors of a place called “Snobs”. The trend is clear and seems likely to last. It’s their parents who are the problem now.\n\nIf you live long enough you see all sorts of surprising trends, and this is certainly one that I never would have imagined. I had always thought of wild behavior as being a province of the young, whereas elderly people tended to be more conservative in their lifestyles.\n\nI’m not in favor of drug prohibition, but if we must have restrictions on drug use then perhaps we should replace the minimum age for pot smoking with a maximum age.\n\nOf course I’m joking, but these articles do raise a serious point. Over recent decades, many thousands of people have been imprisoned for selling marijuana. The drug warriors told us that we needed to do this, despite the huge cost in both dollars spent and lives ruined, because legal marijuana would be abused by young people that lack the maturity to make wise decisions. It now seems that the entire drug war was based on a fallacy. Legalizing marijuana has been associated with a big decrease in pot use among the young. So much human misery, all caused by a misconception.\n\nHere is Titian’s Allegory of Prudence:"}

Unless there is something drastically changing in his policies —militarily, domestically and internationally— we, the world, may be in for an unpleasant rollercoaster.\n\nTariffs are punishment of the world, especially aiming at China and to some extent also at Europe. Or just a game?\n\nTrump is a deal-maker, a gambler of sorts. Already more than 70 nations have requested “negotiating” the tariffs, that’s the “deal-making” Mr. Trump loves so much. At the same time, he believes in intimidating and dominating the world.\n\nBut does he really? Who are his economic advisers? Who are the winners and losers in this gamble?\n\nObviously, the country he wants to punish most is China. But China plays along, she plays the same gamble and just upped the ante of import duties for US goods and services to 125%; the same measure that Trump a day before announced would be the import duties for goods from China. That is the end of the escalation, said China. No higher for them “Les Jeux sont fats,” in casino language.\n\nThe thing is: the US needs China much more than China needs the US —a tremendous price increase in consumer goods (all made in China) may result in US inflation and unemployment, in factory and shop closures. While China has already for years re-oriented her market to Asia and especially the BRICS and their extension, the Global South.\n\n*\n\nClick the share button below to email/forward this article.

For the second Trump presidency in a row, the House and Senate GOP have teed up a legislative agenda that will cut taxes for the wealthy while raiding safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps. They should already know how unpopular this will be: Republicans’ effort to cut Medicaid—under the branding of “Obamacare repeal”—never made it to the finish line in Donald Trump’s first term. But the mere attempt to do so contributed heavily to their loss of 40 House seats, and control of that chamber, in the 2018 midterms.\n\nRepublicans’ destination here is why many Democrats have been content to wait for the Trump administration to overreach—they’ve long assumed that Republicans don’t know any better but to follow this course. And it’s not just the proposed swap of Medicaid funds for tax cuts that Democrats have honed in on. Every organized message from House and Senate Democrats against the Trump administration has led back to their pursuit of tax cuts for the wealthy. Elon Musk’s reckless slashing of the federal government? Banking money for tax cuts for the rich. Universal and reciprocal tariffs? A tax increase on average Americans to offset tax cuts for the rich. What Democrats are trying to say is: The Trump-era Republican coalition may have represented itself as the new party of the working class, but as soon as they get power, they revert to the same old, same old.\n\nOr will it really be the same old, same old? Surprisingly, as Republicans finally set pen to paper on their “one big, beautiful bill” comprising tax cuts, spending cuts, and increases to defense and immigration enforcement spending, they’re suddenly considering a fiscal policy curveball for the ages: raising income taxes on the rich.\n\nSome in the White House, as Axios first reported in late March, were considering allowing the 37 percent rate for the top tax bracket—set in place in the 2017 Trump tax law—to expire, returning it to 39.6 percent. That would have two advantages. It would give them hundreds of billions of additional dollars to use for other tax priorities, like eliminating tax on tips, overtime, or Social Security benefits. More importantly, though, it would wound one of Democrats’ sharpest talking points. As a White House official told Axios, “If we renew tax cuts for the rich paid for by throwing people off Medicaid, we’re gonna get f–king slaughtered.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reporting was initially laughed off on the Hill. Quite literally, in the case of House Republican Whip Tom Emmer, who “tilted his head back and laughed very loudly” when asked about the idea in early April, according to Punchbowl News. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, more sternly, said “no” three times over.\n\nIt’s understandable that they’d be shocked at the suggestion. The debate over a few points here or there in the top marginal tax rate has been a foundational partisan dispute of 21st-century American politics.\n\nIn the early 2000s, President George W. Bush lowered the top marginal rate to 35 percent with his signature tax cuts. Raising that rate back to where it was under the Clinton administration—39.6 percent—was a centerpiece of the next several Democrats presidential campaigns, until President Barack Obama finally achieved it as part of a tax deal following his reelection. The Trump tax cuts lowered it back to 37 percent in 2018. Democrats were unable to raise it back to 39.6 during the Biden administration because Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema—now doing quite well for herself in the private sector—would not support it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has been assumed that Republicans would, at the very least, retain that 37 percent top rate as they put together their new tax package. That is just what happens: Republicans take power and cut the top rate, then Democrats come in and raise it back (or find themselves frustratingly impeded by an Arizona eccentric.) These positions are partisan articles of faith. It’s been practically as rigidly defined as the abortion debate.\n\nRelated From Slate These Big Government Agencies Might Post Exclusively on X. The Implications Are Bigger Than You Think. Read More\n\nBut despite some GOP leaders’ initial laughter, the idea isn’t going away. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hasn’t ruled out such an increase. Trump has reportedly said he’d be OK with such an increase. Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, has said the same (though only speaking for himself, not the group.) And, as Bloomberg reported Tuesday, it’s become more than just chatter at this point, as White House and congressional Republicans are drafting options—including, potentially, a new rate of 40 percent on those making $1 million or more a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are a long way from seeing such a draft policy make its way into federal law. There’s still limited, if any, appetite for it on the Hill. Republican donors, in particular, did not pay for this. There are complicated tie-ins to work out, such as how it would affect business owners’ pass-through income. The enforcer of Republicans’ no-tax-increases pledge, Grover Norquist, will start making a stink. If Trump doesn’t care one way or another, it probably won’t happen. If he really wants it, though, forget the gripes from Norquist or donors or any other element of the GOP old guard: He can make it happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Republicans do raise taxes on the wealthy, the effect could be dramatic. They would be swiping a bedrock policy belief of the Democratic Party’s, and stifling one of Democrats’ central critiques of Republican governance. They would be acknowledging the sudden influx of lower-income voters into their coalition. No, they would not be relinquishing all thoughts they have of comforting the comfortable in this package—a repeal of the estate tax, for example, is still on the table. But it would be a high-profile statement.\n\nAnd if they’re interested in another one: How about reconsidering those Medicaid cuts, too?"}
