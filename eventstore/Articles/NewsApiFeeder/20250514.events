The recall only applies to software released before November, which was updated that same month, and caused minor collisions with chains, gates, and roadway barriers. Nobody was injured in the crashes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Waymo (GOOGL-1.57% ) provides more than 250,000 paid trips every week in some of the most challenging driving environments in the U.S.,” a Waymo spokesperson told Quartz. “We hold ourselves to a high safety standard, and our record of reducing injuries over tens of millions of fully autonomous miles driven shows our technology is making roads safer.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaymo currently operates its robotaxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin. It is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.\n\nLast week, Amazon’s robotaxi company Zoox (AMZN-2.87% ) issued a voluntary software recall following a crash in Las Vegas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZoox said in a post that it made the decision after an incident where one of its unoccupied robotaxis hit a passenger vehicle. No injuries were reported in the incident and and only minor damage occurred to both vehicles, the company said."}

President Donald Trump arrived in the Saudi capital on Tuesday to a lavish reception, escorted by six Royal Saudi F-15 fighter jets. On the ground, he was joined by a who’s who of U.S. tech, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Amazon (AMZN-2.87% ) CEO Andy Jassy, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Alphabet’s (GOOGL-1.57% ) Ruth Porat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWedbush estimates the Saudi Arabian AI opportunity could add $1 trillion to the globe’s total AI addressable market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeal sends Nvidia stock soaring\n\nA sweeping new partnership between Nvidia and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign AI initiative, Humain, was the focus of the gathering. Under the deal, Nvidia will sell 18,000 next-gen Blackwell chips to power the Kingdom’s first supercomputer. Over the next five years, Saudi Arabia plans to build out a network of AI data centers to train and deploy sovereign models as part of its Vision 2030 push to diversify away from oil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn tandem, Nvidia stock soared almost 6% on Tuesday and climbed another 3% before Wednesday’s opening bell, in a two-day rally sparked in large part by the news. A move like that for a company Nvidia’s size is worth roughly $300 billion in market value – equal to Palantir’s (PLTR+1.01% ) entire market cap, for context.\n\nThe regulatory backdrop is significant, too\n\nDays before the trip, the U.S. Commerce Department rescinded the Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule, a sweeping framework that would have imposed tiered export controls across dozens of countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Bloomberg reported, the Trump administration plans to replace it with a more flexible, transactional approach, easing restrictions for close allies like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and tightening them for countries less in favor, including China and Malaysia.\n\n‘The geopolitical question of our time’\n\nWhether the news is unambiguously bullish is another matter.\n\nThe reversal of U.S. policy introduces new layers of uncertainty. There’s the ethical and strategic risk of handing sovereign AI capabilities to authoritarian states. And while transactional diplomacy may unlock short-term access in some markets, it replaces a rules-based system with case-by-case dealmaking. Critics warn that this shift could fragment AI-related laws, regulations, and oversight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, one AI Cold War may be easing. Another looks to be unfolding. “Who controls A.I. is the geopolitical question of our time,” Jim Secreto, a former deputy chief of staff at the Commerce Department, told the New York Times.\n\nFor the Trump administration, that question is becoming less about containment and more about cutting deals."}

While still off all-time highs, there has been lots to like about the e-commerce and cloud giant. Over the five days ended Tuesday, Amazon is up 12% — beating Meta (up 10%) Apple (8.5%) and Microsoft (3.6%), as well as the S & P 500 (up just 4.5%). One big reason for outperformance: the cooling of the trade battle between the United States and China. The world's two biggest economies agreed to suspend most tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days , a sign the governments are making progress in their negotiations. \"Amazon is rebounding nicely as a lot of fears around China tariffs and a possible recession come off,\" said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis. He noted that those factors had \"put a lid on the stock.\" The tariff rule is a huge win for Amazon, as more than 30% of its third-party products — and advertising for those products — come from China. Elevated tariffs – particularly those placed on goods imported from China – could result in higher costs for Amazon and its sellers, in addition to potential supply chain disruptions, making it increasingly difficult to source products from the country. Instead, the lower tariffs \"should provide relief for online retailers to normalize supply chains, which should benefit the both the online advertising and e-comm subsectors [including Amazon],\" Bank of America wrote Monday in a note to clients. Another tailwind: Amazon struck a deal with FedEx on Monday to help deliver large packages to U.S. homes, a role that Amazon that had belonged to UPS, which recently said it would cut back on deliveries as it focuses on profitability. Amazon's partnership with FedEx Amazon should help manage delivery costs, and Amazon has a long-term goal of reducing its cost to serve customers which ultimately allows the company to improve its bottom line. Amazon Web Services (AWS) said on Tuesday is investing $5 billion in Saudi Arabia to help build artificial intelligence infrastructure. It will partner with new Saudi company Humain to bring cloud services, AI tools and tech training to the region. CEO Andy Jassy was in Riyadh on Tuesday for the Saudi Arabia Investment Forum , discussing the AI boom and global trade. Lastly, Amazon Prime Video's ad-supported tier surpassed 130 million active users in the U.S., a 13% increase from the 115 million previously reported last year, The Hollywood Reporter's Alex Weprin reported. Amazon Prime Video's ad-supported tier has surpassed 130 million active users in the U.S., a 13% increase from the 115 million previously reported last year, according to The Hollywood Reporter . We don't like to read too much into multi-day winning streaks. In fact, the stock looked likely to take a breather on Wednesday. But that doesn't change all the good news for Amazon. We last bought Amazon shares on Apr. 15 at roughly $180, recognizing that the stock being down 25% from its Feb. 4 high of $242 was an opportunity. We were also adamant that its post-earnings selloff on May 2 — sparked by cautious forecast — was another opportunity to buy. At the time, we reiterated our 1 rating and our price target of $240.
