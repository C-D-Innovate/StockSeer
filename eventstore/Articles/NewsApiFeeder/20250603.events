Meta\ufffds stock was largely unchanged.\nThis agreement comes as part of Meta and big tech\ufffds broader strategy to power their increasingly energy-intensive AI data centers with renewable energy. Nuclear provides reliable, \ufffdfirm\ufffd power, divorced from seasons and weather patterns that affect solar and wind. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all also made serious investments in nuclear.\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said Tuesday it\ufffds also continuing to search for new locations for the development of  future nuclear power plants, noting it \ufffdhas selected a shortlist of new nuclear projects across multiple U.S. states that represent some of the most feasible opportunities.\ufffd"}
