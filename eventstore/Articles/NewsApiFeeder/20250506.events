The company says that the feature will be available \"on Pixel 8a and Pixel 9 products including 9 Pro Fold\" in a reply to an Issue Tracker ticket concerning Battery Health availability. That leaves out all Pixel models released before the Google Pixel 8a, including the rest of the Pixel 8 series and the original Pixel Fold.\n\n\"The Battery Health Indicator feature is currently supported in Beta 3 on Pixel 8a and Pixel 9 products including 9 Pro Fold,\" a Google employee wrote on May 1. \"Due to product limitations, this feature will not be available on older in-market Pixel devices.\"\n\nNewer Google Pixel devices already showed cycle count data as of last year, but the Battery Health page is set to bring more detailed analytics. Specifically, battery capacity will be shown as a percentage compared to its new state.

It also offers quick links to battery-related support articles, and lists any charging optimization features that are enabled — such as Adaptive Charging.\n\nWhile it's unclear what \"product limitations\" prevent Pixel phones older than the Pixel 8a from supporting the Battery Health page, it may have something to do with the batteries themselves.\n\nStarting with the Pixel 8a, Google says Pixel phones can reach 1,000 charge cycles before needing a battery replacement. Older Pixel phones, namely the Pixel 3 through Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Fold, are only rated for up to 800 charge cycles before a battery replacement is recommended.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAndroid 16, and the Battery Health feature for Pixels, will likely be shown off at Google I/O 2025.

Are there legal limits?\n\ntoggle caption David Swanson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAs President Trump expands the use of the military in immigration enforcement, this nearly 150-year-old law has come into sharp focus.\n\nThe Posse Comitatus Act was designed to limit the use of federal troops in law enforcement activities on American soil. The rule has its exceptions and loopholes, but Trump's second term and his crackdown on immigration are shaping up to be a major test of the law.\n\nToday, thousands of active-duty troops are deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border. What the military is allowed to do there has also dramatically shifted — going beyond the typical roles of supporting the Border Patrol.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAmong the most significant developments came last month, when Trump designated a 170-mile stretch of federal land along the southern border — which spans through California, Arizona and New Mexico — as a military installation, or a national defense area.\n\nOn Thursday, the Department of Defense announced that a second section in Texas will be marked as a military installation.\n\nAt least 82 people have been federally charged for \"unauthorized entry\" into the newly created National Defense Area in New Mexico as a result.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nWhat are the restrictions under the Posse Comitatus Act?\n\nThe federal law was enacted in 1878 following the Civil War, when former Confederate states were either unwilling or unable to enforce civil laws. In response, the federal government stepped in and deployed active-duty troops to maintain order. That led to concerns of potential military overreach.\n\nWhile the law came after the Civil War, it's rooted in one of the country's founding principles, which is the rejection of military involvement in civilian affairs. The ideal was a key grievance in the Declaration of Independence, which was later reflected in the Articles of Confederation and the Bill of Rights.\n\nIn practice, the law prohibits federal armed forces from taking part in civilian law enforcement, like conducting searches, seizures and arrests on American streets, except when \"expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.\"\n\nThis restriction applies to the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Space Force. On the other hand, the Coast Guard is exempt. The same goes for the National Guard, as it typically operates under state authority. However, Guard units become bound to the Posse Comitatus Act when they are called into federal service.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn some cases, the National Guard has served federal interests on state orders. For instance, in 2020, 11 states sent their National Guard troops to Washington D.C., to help respond to the protests over George Floyd's murder.\n\nWhat about the new national defense area?\n\nNational Guard and federal military forces have been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico Border under previous administrations, generally in support roles to the Border Patrol, such as providing equipment, logistics and surveillance.\n\nNow, federal military personnel will be allowed to temporarily detain and search people who are considered trespassing on the newly established national defense area at the southern border — effectively bypassing the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\n\" By doing this, he's sort of supercharging or empowering the military to be heavily involved in the immigration enforcement mission in ways they weren't before,\" said Mark Nevitt, a professor at Emory University School of Law who served as an attorney with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG).\n\nNevitt added that typically a president would need congressional approval to designate a military zone. But Trump was able to sidestep this requirement because he had declared a national emergency at the southern border on his first day in office, which thereby authorizes military construction projects, Nevitt wrote in Just Security.\n\ntoggle caption Army Pfc. Sean Hoch/U.S. Department of Defense\n\nDan Maurer, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army JAG, also raised concerns about the lack of clarity on how much force troops will be allowed to use against people trespassing the new military installation. In the White House's memorandum NSPM-4 regarding the new designation, it states that armed forces will \"follow rules for the use of force.\"\n\nIn Lawfare, Maurer wrote that while those rules usually align with domestic law enforcement standards and the Constitution, they also allow deadly force to protect sensitive property. The situation is further complicated by Trump's framing that the border is facing an \"invasion\" and \"under attack.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Hence the blurring of law enforcement and military operations can lead to ambiguity as to what role they're serving in and thus what force is truly authorized, legal, and reasonable,\" Maurer told NPR.\n\nNevitt worries that blurring the line between military and law enforcement roles could also undermine military readiness, as well as hurt military recruitment and retention.\n\n\"Most people join the military to fight and defend this country, defend their national security interests, deploy overseas,\" he said. \"Not (to) be a domestic law enforcer.\"\n\nThe sweeping exception that Trump has not used yet\n\ntoggle caption Paul Sakuma/AP\n\nA key exception to the Posse Comitatus Act is the Insurrection Act, which gives the president the authority to call on the military during an emergency to curb unrest or rebellion within the U.S.\n\nThe Insurrection Act has been used about 30 times in American history, largely to quell civil unrest. It was last invoked in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush sent Army and Marine troops to Los Angeles to help quell the violence following the acquittal of the police officers who beat Rodney King. It has never been used for immigration enforcement.\n\nThe Insurrection Act can be more concerning than the Alien Enemies Act, which Trump has invoked to detain and deport Venezuelan immigrants, according to Maurer, who is now a professor at the Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law.\n\nLast week, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the president's use of the Alien Enemies Act was \"unlawful.\" Meanwhile, in 1827, the Supreme Court established that the president has the sole authority to invoke the Insurrection Act.\n\n\" But with the Insurrection Act, we already have case law that says courts can't really second guess the decision,\" he said."}

Simply explain what you want, and the AI-powered system builds a fully functional model through an automated agentic approach. Also available as a managed cloud service.\n\nWatch the demo on YouTube:\n\n1. Quickstart\n\nInstallation\n\npip install plexe\n\nUsing plexe\n\nYou can use plexe as a Python library to build and train machine learning models:\n\nimport plexe # Define the model model = plexe . Model ( intent = \"Predict sentiment from news articles\" , input_schema = { \"headline\" : str , \"content\" : str }, output_schema = { \"sentiment\" : str } ) # Build and train the model model . build ( datasets = [ your_dataset ], provider = \"openai/gpt-4o-mini\" , max_iterations = 10 ) # Use the model prediction = model . predict ({ \"headline\" : \"New breakthrough in renewable energy\" , \"content\" : \"Scientists announced a major advancement...\" }) # Save for later use plexe . save_model ( model , \"sentiment-model\" ) loaded_model = plexe . load_model ( \"sentiment-model.tar.gz\" )\n\n2. Features\n\n2.1. 💬 Natural Language Model Definition\n\nDefine models using plain English descriptions:\n\nmodel = plexe . Model ( intent = \"Predict housing prices based on features like size, location, etc.\" , input_schema = { \"square_feet\" : int , \"bedrooms\" : int , \"location\" : str }, output_schema = { \"price\" : float } )\n\n2.2. 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture\n\nThe system uses a team of specialized AI agents to:\n\nAnalyze your requirements and data\n\nPlan the optimal model solution\n\nGenerate and improve model code\n\nTest and evaluate performance\n\nPackage the model for deployment\n\n2.3. 🎯 Automated Model Building\n\nBuild complete models with a single method call:\n\nmodel . build ( datasets = [ dataset_a , dataset_b ], provider = \"openai/gpt-4o-mini\" , # LLM provider max_iterations = 10 , # Max solutions to explore timeout = 1800 # Optional time limit in seconds )\n\n2.4. 🚀 Distributed Training with Ray\n\nPlexe supports distributed model training and evaluation with Ray for faster parallel processing:\n\nfrom plexe import Model # Optional: Configure Ray cluster address if using remote Ray # from plexe import config # config.ray.address = \"ray://10.1.2.3:10001\" model = Model ( intent = \"Predict house prices based on various features\" , distributed = True # Enable distributed execution ) model . build ( datasets = [ df ], provider = \"openai/gpt-4o-mini\" )\n\nRay distributes your workload across available CPU cores, significantly speeding up model generation and evaluation when exploring multiple model variants.\n\n2.5. 🎲 Data Generation & Schema Inference\n\nGenerate synthetic data or infer schemas automatically:\n\n# Generate synthetic data dataset = plexe . DatasetGenerator ( description = \"Example dataset with features and target\" , provider = \"openai/gpt-4o-mini\" , schema = { \"features\" : str , \"target\" : int } ) dataset . generate ( 500 ) # Generate 500 samples # Infer schema from intent model = plexe . Model ( intent = \"Predict customer churn based on usage patterns\" ) model . build ( provider = \"openai/gpt-4o-mini\" ) # Schema inferred automatically\n\n2.6. 🌐 Multi-Provider Support\n\nUse your preferred LLM provider, for example:\n\nmodel . build ( provider = \"openai/gpt-4o-mini\" ) # OpenAI model . build ( provider = \"anthropic/claude-3-opus\" ) # Anthropic model . build ( provider = \"ollama/llama2\" ) # Ollama model . build ( provider = \"huggingface/meta-llama/...\" ) # Hugging Face\n\nSee LiteLLM providers for instructions and available providers.\n\nNote Plexe should work with most LiteLLM providers, but we actively test only with openai/* and anthropic/* models. If you encounter issues with other providers, please let us know.\n\n3. Installation\n\n3.1. Installation Options\n\npip install plexe # Standard installation pip install plexe[lightweight] # Minimal dependencies pip install plexe[all] # With deep learning support\n\n3.2. API Keys\n\n# Set your preferred provider's API key export OPENAI_API_KEY= < your-key > export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= < your-key > export GEMINI_API_KEY= < your-key >\n\nSee LiteLLM providers for environment variable names.\n\n4.

That content generated 58 million views, worth about $2 million worth of \"earned media,\" said Natalie Thiesen, vice-president of tourism.\n\n\"That ability to position our city in a different way and having more eyeballs on Winnipeg, allows us to do our jobs and extend our reach in a way that our budget doesn't allow,\" she said.\n\nPaying to promote the city on a television program with the level of viewership of an NHL game doesn't come cheap, said Martin Fisher, CEO of Show and Tell Agency, a Winnipeg-based advertising firm.\n\n\"You probably would end up having to spend about $1.5 million, $2 million to get the number of eyeballs that would have seen that on a … North American basis … You're into Super Bowl kind of money,\" said Fisher.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWATCH | Fans, local businesses look forward to 2nd round of playoffs:\n\nThe whiteout parties began in 2018. An analysis from Economic Development Winnipeg found the event saw 120,500 people attended the parties over the course of the six weeks the Jets were in the playoffs that year. That did not include the 15,000 people watching the game inside the arena or at downtown bars, restaurants and other places.\n\nIn terms of \"earned media\" — essentially third-party publicity without direct payment — Economic Development Winnipeg calculated the value at roughly $2.2 million, including nearly 400 separate news articles with a reach of over 233 million views.\n\nThe total cost of the party in 2018 was $2,167,000, including $1,084,000 from True North Sports and Entertainment, $120,000 from Economic Development Winnipeg and $962,000 from the City of Winnipeg, not including $153,000 it received from True North to cover extra policing and transit costs.\n\nFelicia Wiltshire, communications director for the City of Winnipeg, said in an email the city may also provide additional \"in-kind\" services, and is heavily involved in planning and execution of the events including any necessary road closures, city beautification and other work."}

That means a pair of roomies could pay roughly $8.50 each per month by going Dutch on a Duo subscription, a nice 29 percent savings compared to separate Individual plans.\n\nIt’s not clear what YouTube might charge for a two-person Premium plan in the U.S., but it’s reasonable to assume a similar discount would be on offer.\n\nThe two-person YouTube Premium trial comes roughly two months after the rollout of YouTube Premium Lite, a new YouTube tier that serves up a cheaper paid YouTube plan with some significant tradeoffs.\n\nYouTube Premium Lite costs just $7.99 a month, significantly less than the standard $13.99/month Premium Individual plan. In exchange, you get an ad-free streaming experience for “most” (but not all) YouTube videos, but you also miss out on key Premium Individual features, including ad-free YouTube Music, video downloads, and background video playback."}

Now, Minecraft remains as a game that can be played on multiple consoles and platforms — just not VR.\n\nWell, officially, that is. Vivecraft will allow Minecraft to continue, as a way to play the sandbox game on Oculus or Windows MR, according to the website. That version requires the original PC Java version of Minecraft, however.\n\nTo be fair, Microsoft signaled its plans in an October update last year. “Our ability to support VR/MR devices has come to an end, and will no longer be supported in updates after March of 2025, when you will receive your final update,” the company said. “After you receive the final update, you will still receive updates on your PC and be able to play without a VR/MR device.\n\n“From this point on you can keep building in your worlds, and your Marketplace purchases (including Minecoins) will continue to be available on a non-VR/MR graphics device such as a computer monitor,” Microsoft said then. “You will no longer be able to use your VR/MR device with Minecraft as it will no longer be supported in the latest updates.”\n\nSince it’s now May, Microsoft tacked on an additional grace period. But now it’s over, and another shovelful of dirt on the metaverse. And goodbye to the best demo I’ve ever witnessed."}

One Actor Thinks So", "fullContent": "In the past few years, there's been an uptick across social media of people attempting to go without any kind of mental or physical stimulation aboard their flight. The practice has been referred to as \"rawdogging,\" a term that has not only led to articles from GQ and Buzzfeed, but has also prompted the American Dialect Society to commemorate it as 2024's Word of the Year. Warburton recently took to TikTok to take partial responsibility, as well as offer a PSA to those who want to \"rawdog\" for themselves (via People):\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"My concern is that somebody's gonna get hurt and if you go into this blindly, you know what I'm saying? Just not reading, watching something, you better be okay with what's going on up here [points to head], inside your 'ol noggin. I'm not, but it's weird and entertaining at times. Just be careful. That's all I'm saying. It's not for novices.\"\n\n\"Seinfeld\" is no stranger to causing a ripple effect, considering the series became a water cooler show after \"The Contest\" introduced people to being masters of their own domain. When was the last time you ever double-dipped a chip at a party without the fear of someone calling you out on it? If I've learned anything from being online, however, it's that someone else has likely done the weird things we do on our own. All it takes is one or a few people to go viral while doing it, hence prompting a chain reaction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Warburton technically never even says \"rawdog\" in the episode, David being the slow fuse epicenter of the trend isn't out of the realm of possibility. The proof is in the Puddy. The term \"rawdogging\" has its roots in describing unprotected sex, but the term has evolved to encompass doing anything without protection or distraction. I'm sure Warburton's parents weren't happy about that either.\n\nAt first glance, I understand the mentality of meditating with a clear headspace. I've scrolled through the flight's movie selection as a way to pass the time when I didn't want to watch or read anything. But a plane is possibly the worst place to find peace unless you're sleeping. Not only are you being jostled around by the turbulence, but the constant thrumming of the big metal bird is one distraction that would drive me insane. Rawdog responsibly, folks.\n\nEvery episode of \"Seinfeld\" is currently streaming on Netflix."}

It’s not bringing back the old version of its once-beloved app, it’s (reportedly) not going to make a streaming video player, and now it’s not making any more speakers with Ikea.\n\nSonos has confirmed to The Verge that it’s winding down its partnership with Ikea, the iconic home furnishings brand that teamed up with the networked home audio manufacturer for some of our favorite wireless speakers.\n\nAmong them were the very first products developed by the duo, the Ikea Symfonisk lamp and bookshelf speakers, which landed in 2019. The speakers, which won our Editors’ Choice award, demonstrated how great-sounding home audio components could also look terrific in the living room while maintaining Ikea-friendly price tags.\n\nSonos says it will continue to support existing Symfonisk speakers while also confirming that no more new models will be coming. The speakers will remain on sale while supplies last.\n\n“Over the past eight years, we’ve had the pleasure of working closely with Idea and are proud of what we’ve achieved,” a Sonos spokesperson told The Verge, adding that “our work together has largely wound down and we won’t be releasing new products as partners.”\n\nBesides the original Symfonisk lamp and bookshelf speakers, the Sonos/Ikea partnership also yielded the Symfonisk floor lamp speaker (which came with a bamboo light shade—again, very Ikea), an updated Symfonisk Speaker Lamp 2, and a Symfonisk picture-frame speaker. (Tech Advisor, our sibling publication, was only so-so about the latter product, although it’s still a nifty idea.)\n\nThe breakup between Sonos and Ikea is disappointing for a couple of key reasons. For starters, the partnership inspired some of the most cleverly designed speakers we’ve ever tested—a floor lamp that’s also a speaker? Really? Yes, really.\n\nAlso, Ikea’s Symfonisk speakers were surprisingly affordable, with the original Symfonisk speaker retailing for a mere $99, compared to $199 for the cheapest (at the time) Sonos speaker.\n\nWord that Sonos won’t make any more speakers with Ikea comes roughly two months after we learned that Sonos won’t be going into the streaming-video business—a wise move.\n\nMeanwhile, Sonos continues to forge ahead with fixes for its much-maligned app. The company remains in a defensive crouch over the poorly received app revamp, which was slammed upon release last year for its spotty performance and array of dropped features.\n\nIndeed, Sonos’s app update was such a disaster that then-CEO Patrick Spence, who once floated the idea of bringing back the old app before walking back his remarks, stepped down from his position in early 2025."}

(Small phones is a prominent example.) Free advice that Apple is willfully ignoring. Of course, you know the saying about free advice but on this particular issue, history seems to be leaning on the horny one’s side as well as the side of almost everyone else in the Apple community who has been giving Apple the very same advice for years.\n\nThat advice? Give up on its ridiculously aggressive anti-steering policy. If you’re not up on App Store jargon, this is the rule the prevents developers from (in certain countries) providing “links” to payment processes outside the comfort and safety of the App Store. Apple has defended this as right and just because, my dear Paula, everyone loves the App Store and its easy and secure payment processing and no one would ever want to be tricked by dastardly developers into using anything else.\n\nNow, much like Toonces the cat, Apple’s anti-steering policy has sent it flying into a crevasse.\n\nU.S. District Court judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers largely ruled in favor of Apple in Epic’s case against the company but finally said enough was enough and the company had to comply. If that wasn’t bad enough, she took a number of Apple executives to task and also referred one, VP of finance Alex Roman, for criminal contempt charges for lying under oath.\n\nWe Apple pundits frequently like to play amateur stock analyst, financial analyst, international trade negotiator, etc., as part of our coverage of the Apple world and, sure, we’re often out of our depth. But you don’t have to be a lawyer to know that getting caught lying under oath is generally not a good thing and, regardless, it’s not a good look.\n\nThe one person who does come out looking relatively good in all this is App Store head and fine fresh Apple fellow Phil Schiller.\n\n…Gonzalez Rogers said Apple’s App Store chief Phillip Schiller “had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction” but that CEO Tim Cook “ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise.”\n\nSchiller was subsequently awarded a golden bust of Greg Davies.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’d like to receive regular news and updates to your inbox, sign up for our newsletters, including The Macalope and Apple Breakfast, David Price’s weekly, bite-sized roundup of all the latest Apple news and rumors. IDG\n\nApple seems to want to deny developers and users the right to use web links as a means of communicating further information in an online context, something humans have been doing for more than 30 years. This policy is probably the most egregious of all the self-serving App Store rules Apple has concocted over the years and it’s no wonder developers are eager to move on from it.\n\nSome developers are even predicting that they’ll be able to lower prices because of this. Can you imagine? Apparently, prices can fall. Not to hear the current state of economic policy in the U.S. talk about it.\n\nWell, at least this is all over now and we can put it behi-\n\n“Apple files appeal to wrest back control of its App Store”\n\nOr not. Sigh.\n\nThis is where we get to the free advice part.\n\nApple is in a bit of a slide these days in terms of public perception. Sure, most developers have been mad at the company since… well, 1976. Meanwhile, most Apple customers probably don’t know anything about this. Even if they heard about it, they probably thought it was all a little too inside baseball for them to worry about. To them, the iPhone is just a device what they plays their Wordle on.\n\nBut now that Apple is being forced to comply and users will start to get more information and more choice, that may change. Regardless of whether or not customers notice, the company’s continued clawing to keep this rule that no one else liked is a bad look. On top of criminal contempt, which is not such a great look either.\n\nJust drop it, Apple. You can afford to financially and you may find that the currency of good will is something you need more right now than services revenue."}

Starting mid-May 2025, when you “switch back” to classic Outlook, new Outlook will simply minimize to the taskbar with suppressed notifications and reminders while launching a separate instance of classic Outlook. Starting early-June 2025, you won’t have to “switch back” at all—you can simply open classic Outlook alongside new Outlook.\n\nThese changes will automatically roll out over the next few weeks without needing any action on your part. The entire worldwide rollout is expected to be completed by late-July 2025."}

But newer and cheaper AMD cards appear to be on the way, after a retailer in Brazil leaked a new Gigabyte model. Say hello to the AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT.\n\nOnline shop Terabyte showed a Gigabyte version of the as-yet-unannounced card, briefly and with no price attached, before taking the page down. According to VideoCardz.com, this version of the GPU includes 16 gigabytes of GDDR6 memory, a Navi 44 chip, and 2,048 stream processors. That would give it the same memory as the (presumably) more expensive RX 9070, with a less powerful processor and only about 60 percent of the shaders. A big question mark in the spec sheet would be the memory bus, with previous speculation pinning it at 128-bit, half the width of the 9070.\n\nWe saw both 8GB and 16GB versions of the 9060 XT back in March, with that more narrow memory bus on the spec sheet, but some outlets have reported that the 8GB version of the card has been scrapped. Considering the big focus on expanded memory requirements in PC gaming, especially in the mid-range of graphics cards, that makes sense. But we’re also seeing a lot of PC gamers just priced out of upgrades between rising prices, low supply, and various economic factors.\n\nRetail listings tend to indicate an announcement is coming soon, but with so many variables in play, it’s also possible that launches are getting pushed back.

We didn’t have an official launch date for the 5060, just “May.” Now we know it’ll be here on May 19 — that’s the Monday after next. The price in the U.S. is mercifully unchanged from the $299 announcement MSRP.\n\nThe RTX 5060 Ti is a solid 1080p gaming card, at least in its 16GB upgrade version. The 8GB variant of the card has been met far less warmly, which might help explain why Nvidia didn’t send out review units before the launch. That means the 5060, sans Ti and saddled with the same 8GB memory, might be less than impressive, especially for the price.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, the 8GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti that’s on store shelves right now for $380 sometimes underperforms Intel’s Arc B580 card…which has a retail price of $250. Yeah, it looks like Nvidia isn’t exactly making a play for the budget space with these entries, perhaps leaning on OEM gaming desktops or those whose brand loyalty outweighs their desire for performance.\n\nEarlier today we saw the latest leaks for AMD’s newest desktop card, the Radeon RX 9060 XT. It’s coming with a 16GB version, presumably competing with the RTX 5060 Ti at the same level, though pricing has yet to be revealed. A 9060 version, which would compete directly with the RTX 5060, is not yet verified."}

Not for me.\n\nMicrosoft latest Surface 13-inch Surface Laptop and 12-inch Surface Pro have finally done away with the iconic Surface Connect connector in favor of USB-C. If you’ve never used a Surface, that means little; if you have, it’s a big part of what made a Surface a Surface.\n\nThe Surface Connect debuted about a decade ago, with the Surface Pro 3 — which, in keeping with Microsoft’s rule of threes, was the first Microsoft Surface tablet that really nailed what a Windows tablet could do. I wrote then that the new charger broke compatibility with previous chargers, and that’s true. But it did two things: offered a convenient, safe way to charge your Microsoft laptop or tablet, and kicked off an 11-year run where one Surface charger ruled them all.\n\nThere’s a lot made about Apple’s MagSafe charger, and rightly so. MagSafe debuted with the MacBook Pro, and its magnetic connector meant that if you kicked the power cable by mistake, you wouldn’t yank the laptop off its desk. Surface Connect offered the same advantage, though a few years later.\n\nFor years, my only concern was whether to insert the Surface Connect with the cord either going back-to-front or front-to-back. Mark Hachman / Foundry\n\nEven better, it meant that consumers didn’t have to worry about losing a Surface charger. For years, charger compatibility was one of the best attributes of the IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad ecosystem: if you had one charger, chances are you’d be able to use it again and again on successive purchases. Over time, loyal customers amassed multiple chargers, one for home and on the road.\n\nI only ever had one Surface charger wear out, and only the Surface Book 2’s infamous power problem made me question Microsoft’s decision. In recent years Microsoft moved to lower-power 45W and 65W chargers, which meant that older, more powerful chargers tended to work just fine as backups.\n\nMicrosoft plans to add agentic AI to upcoming devices. Read this story for more.\n\nThe one feature that Microsoft never really updated was the hidden USB-A port inside the Surface’s power brick, which served as a simplistic way to power early smartphones but later became outdated. Microsoft could have updated it with a more sophisticated USB-C connection, but probably wanted to sell more Surface Docks instead.\n\nIronically, the 2023 Surface Thunderbolt Dock was the first time Microsoft ditched the Surface Connect port. The world was moving to Thunderbolt, and regulatory bodies like the European Union were demanding a move away from proprietary standards and to universal ones like USB-C. Thunderbolt, which uses the USB-C connector, became the chosen standard instead.\n\nIn the intervening years, you could charge a Surface either with its own charger or over USB-C or Thunderbolt, which meant that it offered flexibility many other laptops couldn’t.\n\nMicrosoft’s Surface chargers boasted an extra USB-A power port. Because you never knew when. Mark Hachman / Foundry\n\nBut there’s another thing that brings it a touch of ennui: like Thunderbolt — and before Thunderbolt became popular — Surface Connect was specifically designed to move both power and data. We live in a world where Microsoft never introduced an Xbox gaming PC, and where it never launched a Surface laptop with an external Xbox-branded eGPU that could have turned the business day’s business PC into that evening’s gaming PC. If only. Microsoft never even bothered to let a third-party company accomplish what it was itself unwilling to do.\n\nNow, the only reason I’ll keep old Surface chargers around will be to power the old Surface devices that still hang around my office. Over time, however, more and more USB-C chargers will replace them, especially as gaming-optimized USB-C chargers emerge.\n\nI don’t know if the Surface Connect charger deserves to be buried in the graveyard of dead Microsoft hardware, but I’ll miss it anyway. Farewell, old friend."}

(English faculty, we do mean “literally” here; the roof of Chester A. Arthur Hall would collapse tomorrow without untenured faculty supporting its joists on their shoulders.)

Take department meeting minutes and edit out all the personal attacks.\n\nAdvise all the student clubs that seem like a real handful, including the falconry club, those kids that act like they’re playing Quidditch, the Society of Students who Misinterpret Stoic Philosophy, the Organization for Students Who Just Discovered Hunter S. Thompson and Now That’s Their Whole Personality, and the second falconry club that broke off from the original falconry club.\n\nStart a pyramid scheme to pay the librarian’s salary.\n\nDress as our lovable Fighting Elk mascot “Elkvis Costello” for all track and field meets (make sure you can do a back handspring and land in the splits).\n\nFigure out how our Tutoring Center can steal Wi-Fi from the apartment complex next to campus.\n\nSave a prospective student’s life by shielding them with your body during a bear attack.\n\nRemember, these standards exist to help us decide whether you have a job in academia forever or will never work in academia again.

He is particularly interested in global health and pandemic prevention, anti-poverty efforts, economic policy and theory, and conflicts about the right way to do philanthropy.\n\nThis is the future: looking into your crystal ball but actually asking the AI on your phone. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nBeing able to predict the future seems nice. I would’ve liked to know that my S&P 500 index funds would peak in mid-February and then fall off a cliff in April. It would’ve been helpful for my reporting in the lead-up to the inauguration to know just how far the Trump administration would go to attack foreign aid. And while I’m at it, I’d like some sense of where mortgage rates are going, so I can better judge when to buy a house.\n\nThe art of systematically making these kinds of predictions is called forecasting, and we’ve known for a long time that some people — so-called superforecasters — are better at it than others. But even they aren’t Nostradamuses; major events still surprise them sometimes. Superforecasters’ work takes time and effort, and there aren’t many of them.\n\nIt’s also hard for us mortals to emulate what makes them so effective. I wrote a whole profile of one of the world’s best superforecaster teams, called the Samotsvety group, and despite their tips and tricks, I didn’t leave the experience as a superforecaster myself.\n\nBut you know what’s sometimes better at learning than I am? AI models.\n\nIn recent years, the forecasting community has increasingly pivoted to trying to build and learn from AI-fueled prediction bots. More specialized fields have, of course, been doing this in various forms for a while; algorithmic trading in financial markets, for instance, where computer programs using various prediction tools trade assets without human intervention, has been around for decades. But using AI as a more general-purpose forecasting tool is a newer idea.\n\nEveryone I spoke with in the field agrees that the top human forecasters still beat machines.\n\nThe best evidence for this comes from tournaments run quarterly by Metaculus, a leading prediction website, where participants compete to forecast the future most accurately. Originally for humans only, Metaculus recently began bot tournaments, where contestants enter custom-made AI-driven bots whose track record can then be compared to the best human predictors.\n\nSo far there, we have results for three quarters — Q3 and Q4 of 2024, and Q1 of 2025 — and in each quarter, Metaculus’s human superforecasters beat the best machines. (If you want to try, there’s a $30,000 prize for each quarter’s winner.)\n\nBut the gap, Metaculus CEO Deger Turan tells me, is narrowing with each quarter. More intriguing still is the fact that the best model in Q1 this year was incredibly simple: It just pulled some recent news articles, then asked o1, at the time the most advanced OpenAI model, to make its own prediction. This approach couldn’t beat humans, but it beat a lot of AI models that were much more sophisticated.\n\no1 is no longer the cutting-edge OpenAI model; as of this writing, it’s o3. And by some metrics, o3 isn’t as good as Gemini 2.5 Pro, the best model from Google DeepMind. All of which is to say: While humans basically stay the same, the AIs are only getting better, and that could mean that the predictions they make will only get better as well.\n\nAlmost every arena of human life relies on good prediction. Lawyers predict whether or not their opponent will agree to a settlement. Construction supervisors predict when a building project will finish. Movie producers predict what script will be a hit. Singles predict whether the person they’re chatting up would prefer a first date over coffee or beer.\n\nWe’re not very good at these predictions right now, but we could get much, much better soon. We’re only just starting to realize the implications of that kind of shift.\n\nHow AI forecasting works\n\nIn theory, an “AI forecaster” is just a program that relies upon machine learning models of one form or another to predict future events.\n\nPrediction is at the heart of what machine learning models do: They analyze vast reams of data and then come up with models that can predict outside that data. For generative models like ChatGPT or Claude or Midjourney, that means predicting the next word or pixel that a user wants in response to a query. For the algorithmic trading models that financiers have been building at least since the founding of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies in 1982, it means predicting the future path of asset prices in stock, bond, and other markets, based on past performance.\n\nFor more generalized predictions about world events, forecasters these days tend to rely heavily on general-purpose models from firms like xAI, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, or Anthropic. These are trained with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of GPUs over several months, which is one reason why it’s much more promising for the relatively small teams working on using AI for forecasting to piggyback on all that training than to start from scratch. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that has signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent. One of Anthropic’s early investors is James McClave, whose BEMC Foundation helps fund Future Perfect.)\n\nGlossary of forecasting terms Forecasting is a world unto itself, with plenty of forecasting-specific jargon and references. Here’s a brief guide to some common terms you’ll hear in the forecasting world. Base rate: The historical rate at which a given phenomenon happens (e.g., the rate at which countries go to war, or the percentage of days when the S&P 500 drops overall), before adjusting for specifics of a given case. Establishing your base rate is often the first step in forecasting. Brier score: A common measure of how accurate forecasts turn out to be. Computed using a formula measuring the distance between a forecaster’s assigned probabilities and actual outcomes. Calibration: How well the probabilities a forecaster assigns to events happening match up with whether they actually happen — e.g., do events the forecaster estimates as 70 percent likely occur 70 percent of the time? Metaculus: A popular website where forecasters can make predictions and compare accuracy. Not structured like a prediction market. Prediction market: A stock-type market, usually online, where participants can bet real currency, cryptocurrency, or play money on specific events happening or not. Kalshi, Polymarket, and Manifold are popular prediction markets. Scope sensitivity: The ability to reason clearly about the scale of different phenomena. An important attribute of good forecasters. Superforecaster: A human whose forecasts are reliably much more accurate, and better calibrated, than the average human’s.\n\nImagine if you are, in late 2024, trying to train a model to predict who the Democratic nominee that year will be; you know it will be Kamala Harris, but to train the model, you try to only give it data from before that became obvious. If that data, though, isn’t purely from early 2024, and includes references to Harris’s eventual nomination, your forecast could perform very well, but only because it has access to data it’d never have in a real-world context.\n\nA more promising approach comes from UC Berkeley computer scientists Danny Halawi, Fred Zhang, Chen Yueh-Han, and Jacob Steinhardt. Their forecaster also relied on language models, but did extensive amounts of “scaffolding”: instead of simply letting the bot run free, they asked the language model to do a series of very specific things, in a very specific order, to get the final result:\n\nFirst, the model is asked to come up with a set of queries to send to a newswire service to gain more information on the question being forecast. Then the queries are sent, the news service sends replies, and the language model is asked which replies are likely to be most helpful. It then summarizes the top replies. This process is first performed on old questions for which answers are already known, and with old news articles. A model is then asked to predict based on summaries of these old articles; it is fine-tuned based on whether these predictions are accurate or not, to improve its performance. That fine-tuned model, and several other more general-purpose models, are then asked for predictions, and an average of the different models’ views is used.\n\nJust asking the language models directly, they found, led to terrible predictions: “Most models’ scores are around or worse than random guessing,” the team wrote in their paper. But once they were able to fine-tune models by showing what thousands of successful predictions (and their underlying reasoning) looked like, the results were much better.\n\nThe resulting forecasting bot got 71.5 percent of questions correct. By comparison, the human prediction website the researchers used for comparison took the average prediction of their participants and got 77 percent accuracy. That human comparator isn’t as good as the best superforecasters, but it’s certainly better than random chance.\n\nThe takeaway: The AI forecaster is not quite up to human level, and certainly not up to the level of human “superforecasters” who beat the crowd. But it’s not too far away.\n\nWhy forecasting is hard for AIs\n\nThat’s impressive, but progress since has been fairly slow. “Arguably, from an academic perspective, nothing has surpassed [UC Berkeley’s] Steinhardt’s paper, which is now a full year old,” Dan Schwarz, CEO of the startup FutureSearch, which builds AI-based forecasting tools, told me.\n\nA full year may not sound like much, but that’s because you’re thinking in human terms. In the world of AI, a year is an eternity. ​That fact underlines something Schwarz and other entrepreneurs working on AI for forecasting told me: this stuff is harder than it looks.\n\nOne limitation is, ironically, that language models are not great quantitative thinkers or logical reasoners. Some common forecasting questions take the form of “will X event happen by Y date”: “Will China invade Taiwan by 2030,” or “Will China invade Taiwan by 2040.” One logical implication is that, for a given question, the odds should stay the same or increase as the date gets later into the future: since “China invading before 2040” includes all future where “China invades before 2030,” the odds of it happening by 2040 should, at the very least, not be lower than the odds of it happening by 2030.\n\nBut language models don’t think logically and systematically enough to know that. Turan, the CEO of forecasting platform Metaculus, notes that a few bots that entered into the platform’s contests have tried to impose this kind of consistency on them and were designed so as to force forecasts to be internally consistent. “They end up having way better results,” Turan says. Phil Godzin, a software engineer who won the fourth-quarter 2024 contest, has explained that the first step in his model is “asking an LLM to group related questions together and predict them in batches to maintain internal consistency.”\n\nThis limitation may become less important due to the dawn of “reasoning models,” like OpenAI’s o3/o4-mini and DeepSeek’s R1. These models differ from previous language models in that they undergo extensive late-stage training to ensure they give correct answers to logical and mathematical questions that can be easily checked (like “how many ‘r’s are in ‘strawberry’”). They are also typically designed to use more computing power when queried, to ensure these kinds of questions are answered accurately. In theory, this evolution in the models should make consistency in forecasts easier to maintain, though it’s too soon to see if this advantage shows up in practice.\n\nSchwarz of FutureSearch cites poor web research skills as a crucial bottleneck. Despite rollouts of flashy features like ChatGPT’s “Deep Research” mode, collation of basic facts about a given situation is still a major challenge for AI models.\n\nFutureSearch this week revealed Deep Research Bench, an attempt to provide a benchmark for web-based research done by leading LLMs. It finds that, as of May 2025, even the best models struggle mightily with routine research tasks. The “Find Number” task, for instance, asked models to find a specific data point (e.g., how many FDA medical device recalls there have been in history). The best model, OpenAI o3, got a score of 69 percent on that; many got less than half right, and DeepSeek R1, which made a splash a few months ago, got less than a third.\n\nThe models did even worse at more complex tasks, like locating whole data sets. The best overall score, from o3, was 0.51 out of 1. FutureSearch estimates that a competent, smart, but fallible human should be able to get 0.8. “We can conclude that frontier agents under low elicitation substantially underperform smart generalist researchers who are given ample time,” the authors conclude.\n\nSteinhardt, the Berkeley statistician who coauthored last year’s paper, frames the situation a bit more positively. Sure, AIs have limitations, but ChatGPT was introduced just two and a half years ago, and they’re already nipping at humans’ heels. “I’d guess that if you applied the best-known forecasting ideas to the best AI systems today, you’d outperform the best human forecasters working as a group,” Steinhardt says. “Why is it good at this? Because humans are just really, really bad forecasters.”\n\nGood forecasting requires you to be honest about your mistakes and to learn from them; to change your views all the time, by little increments, rather than suddenly and all at once; and to not be distracted by what’s prominently in the news and being discussed around you, but give proper weight to all the information you’re receiving.\n\nHumans aren’t especially good at any of that. We tend to base our beliefs on many topics on a single piece of information, often information that isn’t even relevant. We give much more weight to information that is easier to recall or more readily available, whether or not it’s more important. We’re absolutely terrible at thinking about scope — even experts struggle to give, say, a thousand times the weight to a number in the billions compared to the millions. It stands to reason that AIs could be better at all of this.\n\nA world with AI forecasts\n\nSuperforecasting, the bible of the whole field of general-purpose forecasting, came out in 2015. The psychologist who coauthored it, the University of Pennsylvania’s Philip Tetlock, based it on research that had been ongoing for decades before that.\n\nYet it’s fair to say that, friendly coverage from folks like me aside, the idea that there are clear strategies that enable you to better predict the future hasn’t set the world on fire. When the New York Times reports on border tensions in India and Pakistan, it does not cite superforecasters’ view on likely outcomes. The White House does not ask superforecasters for a prediction on how China might respond to higher tariffs. Investing firms don’t get into bidding wars to hire the best superforecasters to project trends.\n\nThis raises an important corollary question: If the world doesn’t have a ton of demand for human superforecasting, would that change at all if it’s done by machines? Why should AI superforecasting be different?\n\nThis worry might account for the relatively small scale of most AI forecasting efforts. Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, and other leading labs aren’t prioritizing it. A few small startups, like FutureSearch, ManticAI (a top performer on the Metaculus competitions), and Lightning Rod Labs, are. Presumably, if the big labs thought that superhuman forecasting were a big economic game-changer, they’d invest more in it. Certainly, that’s what a superforecaster would surmise.\n\nThat said, there are good reasons to think superhuman AI forecasting that is forecasting better than the best humans today would be a big deal. Human forecasters require time, energy, and resources to make good forecasts; they can’t spit out an accurate probability estimate in a matter of minutes. A good AI model, in theory, could.\n\nCompare how useful a research librarian who takes a few weeks to send you a stack of useful books would have been before the dawn of the internet, to the ability to search Google today. Both give you useful outputs. A good librarian’s output might even be more useful. But getting results instantly is incredibly important, and massively increases demand for the service.\n\nBen Turtel, a cofounder of Lightning Rod AI, imagines his forecasting AI being especially useful in cases where someone has a lot of unstructured data that the forecaster can evaluate quickly. Take, for instance, a nurse or doctor trying to anticipate a patient’s trajectory based on scattered notes in their medical records, plus evidence from studies correlating outcomes with patient attributes like whether they smoke or their age. That is a difficult task for which there is no one recipe. Having a model that can instantly and accurately combine patient-specific data with broader evidence, and provide a prognosis with a probability, would ease their jobs considerably.\n\nSimilarly, companies that operate abroad often pay for political risk consultants that purport to tell them, say, “how dangerous is it to be working in Jordan right now,” or “what are the odds that a coup happens in Myanmar while we’re working there.” Demonstrably superhuman AI forecasting might change that work considerably, and could threaten a lot of those consultancies — if those AI forecasts were trusted.\n\nThe “if trusted” part, though, is key. An AI superforecaster would be, if nothing else, a deeply strange entity. Imagine going up to America’s octogenarian president and saying, “We made an oracle out of silicon, and it is now better at predicting wars than the CIA. You need to listen to it, and not your advisers with millennia of combined experience.” The whole scenario feels laughable. Even if you can prove a model is better than human experts on some class of problems, there’ll be a long way to go before relevant decision-makers would truly believe and internalize that fact.\n\nThe black-box nature of modern LLMs is part of the problem: If you ask one for a prediction, we don’t ultimately know what computation it’s doing to come to that answer. We might see a hybrid period first, where LLMs are asked for explanations of their predictions and decision makers only act on their judgment if the explanations make sense. Even still, acting on AI advice in some contexts, like medicine, could open risk-averse providers and administrators to lawsuits or worse.\n\nBut we can get accustomed to what feels strange. A good model here might be Wikipedia. In the 2000s, the website was popular and gradually improving in quality, but there were strong norms against citing it or relying upon it. Anyone could edit it; obviously it couldn’t be trusted. But over time, those norms eroded as it became clear that on many topics, Wikipedia was equally or more accurate than more traditional sources.\n\nAI prediction bots might follow a similar trajectory. First, they’re a curiosity. Then they’re a guilty pleasure that many secretly count on. Finally, we accept that they’re onto something, and they begin shaping the way we all make decisions."}

Microsoft now says that that future is arriving, at least within a small corner of Windows 11.\n\nMicrosoft is promising that you’ll be able to use natural language to change aspects of your Windows 11 Settings menu, and Windows will go out and make those changes for you using “agents,” or small bits of AI that will work on your behalf — at least if you own a Copilot+ PC with an AI-accelerating NPU onboard.\n\nMicrosoft has begun to use its Surface devices as a showcase for its latest software, and the new 13-inch Surface Laptop and 12-inch Surface Pro are no exception. They’ll serve as launch vehicles for Windows Recall, semantic search, and Click-to-Do, but also brand new features like agentic AI and relighting features for Photos, object editing and sticker generation for Paint, and more.\n\nMicrosoft announced these changes alongside a smaller Surface Laptop and Surface Pro…which unfortunately break a decade’s worth of charger compatibility by moving wholesale to USB-C.\n\nAgentic AI comes to Windows\n\nThe unexpected addition to Microsoft’s AI stable is an AI “agent” that will manage individual settings within Windows, Microsoft said. This is something Microsoft originally promised Copilot would offer, but the technology never progressed past simple tasks like turning on dark mode. Microsoft then pulled the feature back, with the feature providing guides in how to do what you wanted, rather than actually performing the task for you.\n\nThe agentic search capability feels more what people may have hoped for when they heard of the concept of AI within Windows. Now, you’ll be able to tell Windows 11’s Settings what to do with natural language, according to Microsoft, and Settings will either tell you what to do — or, with your permission — actually perform the action for you. In the examples Microsoft is showing, “fixing it” might require one or more actions.\n\nNotice how the term “Fix It” is being used here. Microsoft\n\nIt won’t just be a few things, either. Microsoft is promising that you’ll be able to manage “thousands” of individual settings using this agentic AI.\n\n“Today marks the next chapter in our AI journey, unlocking even more experiences that take your productivity, creativity and connection to the next level,” said Navjot Virk, corporate vice president of Windows Experiences. “We believe that technology should work alongside you, enabling you to do more.”\n\nMicrosoft is showing off an agent, where a user complains about a problem and the AI fixes it. Microsoft\n\nAI upgrades to Paint, Photos, and Snipping Tool\n\nThe new Relight AI feature within Photos is a bit on the subtle side. If you’re an average photographer, you know that lighting can make or break a photo; a backlit shot, for example, may cast the subject into shadow. Now, Photos will allow you to create multiple AI-generated lighting sources, and place them in your photo, controlling their brightness and color. Don’t think of these as floating spheres of light. Instead, this feature will simulate what would happen if you used various types of actual lights, placing them around the room (and out of frame) to light your photo’s subject.\n\nI still don’t know why Microsoft continues to divide specific functions inside Paint and Photos into separate tools, but it is. In Paint, Microsoft is adding Object Select.\n\nThis feels a bit more like the Magic Eraser object editing features that Google has added, or that you can specify within Photoshop. In any case, Object Select promises to allow you to add generative add, erase, and fill capabilities to a specific object, rather than part of the scene. It’s the difference between trying to manually “brush out” a tractor from a countryside scene, and allowing AI to identify and then remove the tractor in one fell swoop.\n\nAn example of the new AI-powered lighting app within Photos. Microsoft\n\nIt feels like that same technology is being adapted to the Windows Snipping Tool, too. Microsoft is saying that this updated Snipping Tool can “interpret the intent of what you’re trying to capture,” possibly minimizing the time it might take for you to grab the perfect snip.\n\nMicrosoft is also adding a sticker generator to Paint, which feels a lot like the memoji found within iOS, but without the ability to animate. You’ll be able to cut and paste these new stickers into various chats and other apps, Microsoft promises. (That almost certainly implies that a dedicated sticker creator is coming to Teams, eventually.)\n\nThe new sticker generator for Paint. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft also appears to be committing to the upgraded Start menu that includes the Phone Link sidebar. Microsoft first previewed this feature last June, but began showing it off in the context of both Android and iPhones this January. Essentially, this “sidebar” serves as a dashboard for the phone you have in your pocket: how many messages and unanswered calls you have waiting, and (in the case of Android) a quick shortcut to photos you may have snapped with your phone, too.\n\nMicrosoft executives also alluded to new features which are coming, too, which will include updates to the Microsoft Store, “AI actions within File Explorer,” and Microsoft Edge Game Assist, which can serve as a help guide while you game.\n\nMicrosoft’s updated Start menu for Windows 11 includes a small dashbar for your phone, too. Microsoft\n\nHow real is all this?\n\nAt this point it’s hard to say how near these features are to becoming reality. Microsoft tends to test new features slowly, and tends to roll them out first for Copilot+ PCs running on Qualcomm’s Arm processor. That’s a thin slice of the available PC market.\n\nMicrosoft has steadily announced the progression of Recall, the improved search, and Click-to-Do, from their announcement a year ago to trials on Copilot+ PCs powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chip, to an expansion to Copilot+ PCs with AMD and Intel chips inside. Microsoft hasn’t said anything about how the additional, brand-new features will deploy, but they’ll probably be on a conservative timeline, too.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Microsoft announced another intriguing AI feature, Copilot Vision, about a month ago. I have yet to be able to make it work in a usable form. Any new AI features should probably move forward at a similarly slow pace.\n\nSmaller features, though, like Relight, tend to deploy more quickly. It’s important to note that Microsoft hasn’t announced any timelines for these features, but I’d expect Microsoft to deploy its smaller tweaks to Paint and Photos before the more significant updates to Settings debut.\n\nThis story was updated at 7:33 AM PT with additional details."}

It’s a rare day that I leave the house without them. And today, multiple Shokz models are deeply discounted at a bunch of stores. Check ’em out!\n\nIf you aren’t familiar with how these work, they sit outside of your ears just behind your temple, vibrating the bones in your head to deliver music right to your eardrum. This keeps your ear canals open and unobstructed so you can hear everything around you while still listening to music, podcasts, or what have you. It takes a little getting used to, but it’s a transformative way to listen to just about anything. They’re popular for cyclists and runners who need to be aware of their surroundings, but I love Shokz headphones for everything when I’m in public.\n\nShokz\n\nIf you’re looking for the cheapest way to get started, I recommend the Shokz OpenMove. This is the basic no-frills model, very easy to set up, with physical buttons for power, play/pause/tracking, and volume control. And unlike some more recent designs, it charges via a standard USB-C cable. It’ll last you about 8 hours on a charge and has minimal water resistance. Normally $80, you can get it on Amazon for under $55. It’s also available from Best Buy, B&H, and Walmart at that price.\n\nGet the OpenMove bone conduction headphones for $55\n\nIf you want something a bit more premium, go with the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2. I bought these last year to get more battery life, for kayaking trips that go up to 12 hours. They’re also lighter, slimmer, and have better audio, with deeper bass and clearer mids and trebles. I wouldn’t say they’re as good as standard earbuds or cans—no bone conduction design is—but it’s a definite upgrade versus the OpenMove.\n\nThe Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 also recharges via USB-C (the original OpenRun Pro did not) and has full physical controls. It’s got the same IP55 water resistance as the cheaper OpenMove design, but for what it’s worth, I took an (ahem) unscheduled swim in Lake Wallenpaupack on my last kayak trip and it still works without issue.\n\nThe OpenRun Pro 2 is going for $140 on Amazon, a $40 discount on its retail price and well worth it in my opinion. They’re available in “Standard” and “Mini” sizes, with the only difference being a slightly shorter band for smaller heads. Amazon has these available in various colors, but if you want the spiffy orange version (harder to find), head over to Best Buy. If stock runs out, check B&H and Walmart, too.\n\nGet the OpenRun Pro 2 bone conduction headphones for $140"}

Those two factors appear to be combining in disturbing ways in a wave of kidnappings and ransoms in western Europe. Wealthy crypto investors are now being singled out for kidnappings, according to police.\n\nA report from The Guardian (via PCGamer) says that a man was abducted on the streets of Paris last Thursday, with masked attackers forcing him into a van and then holding him captive until police rescued him on Saturday. Five men were arrested at the house after a raid, but unfortunately the unnamed victim had a finger cut off in a rather cliché ransom attempt. The kidnappers were apparently trying to extort his son—a “crypto-millionaire”—before the scheme fell apart.\n\nTwo other crypto-driven kidnappings have occurred in France, one in January and one in December, both times with the victim recovered by police after raids and with some significant distress. Similar stories have occurred in Spain and Belgium, again, with the victims recovered by police and at least some kidnappers arrested.\n\nCryptocurrency is a unique variable in this pattern of wealthy kidnappings and ransoms. Though cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are easily trackable via public blockchain ledgers, the holders of the currency themselves can be anonymous, leading to its popularity as a method for fraud, money laundering, and other crime. It’s possible—though by no means easy or straightforward—to move cryptocurrency into conventional wealth and evade law enforcement, especially over international borders.\n\nThe cryptocurrency boom seems to be over now that “mining” crypto, which is essentially the process of turning electricity into digital wealth, is no longer as profitable as it once was. But the accumulations of wealth via cryptocurrency are still very much in the spotlight, attracting criminals to take advantage of less-informed investors via old-fashioned “pump-and-dump” schemes with a fresh coat of paint.\n\nCryptocurrency is also a favorite tool of romance scams, with victims lured into putting real money into fake coins via the promise of investment gains in a system called “pig butchering.” These organized crime setups are doubly disturbing, as they require huge operations that often use kidnapping and forced labor in developing countries."}

The QR code-based system assures customers that they can enjoy \"safety with genuine Arctic quality.\" The company confirmed that the program is in response to counterfeit pastes.\n\nArctic reiterates the common wisdom that \"thermal paste plays a central role in any PC build that relies on effective cooling, as it ensures optimal heat transfer from the processor to the heat sink.\" We have extensive articles testing individual new pastes, compounds, pads, and our bumper round up with over 50 pastes tested and ranked (updated earlier this year). Arctic MX pastes rub shoulders with the best, and might be the nearest we have to an industry standard, as all Tom's Hardware CPU testing is performed with a blob of MX-4 betwixt IHS and cooler block.\n\nOur email from Arctic mentions that counterfeits are becoming \"increasingly prevalent,\" which seems to be why the new product verification system has been introduced.\n\n(Image credit: Arctic)\n\nSo, how does it work? Well, Arctic has a live MX Authenticity Check site already, so you can go and see for yourself. In brief, when you receive your new thermal paste from Arctic or one of the many retailers that carry these compounds, you first check the seal, scratch it to reveal a QR code, scan it with your mobile, and then verify it online. According to Arctic, the whole process takes \"just a few seconds.\" After you are done, you will know if your paste is genuine Arctic gloop, or a dastardly doppelgänger dupe. While the program has been around for a while, the new 4-step graphic (seen above) is a new feature to make the verification process more readily apparent to customers.\n\nIs the Arctic paste tube in your spares drawer genuine?\n\nMany PC enthusiasts will already have a tube or two of thermal paste in their toolboxes, tool bags, or drawers. We even reported on tests showing 20-year-old paste – an ancient syringe of Arctic Cooling Silicone Paste – is still useful, despite being left in the rearview mirror by the latest formulations. But without the new QR-code system in place, there doesn't seem to be a way to confirm that your Arctic paste is genuine unless you bought it directly from the company."}

Microsoft is announcing smaller, less powerful revisions of the Microsoft Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop, all built around a more conservative version of Qualcomm’s battery-sipping Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus chip.\n\nSmaller doesn’t necessarily mean dramatically cheaper, however. And while earlier reports said Microsoft would ship both devices with 12-inch screens, that’s not quite what we’re getting.\n\nThe new $899 13-inch Surface Laptop is very similar to the existing 13.8-inch Surface Laptop 7, which actually ships for as low as $999.99 with a Snapdragon X Plus chip inside. Meanwhile, the smaller 12-inch Surface Pro will cost as little as $799.99, below the $999.99 Microsoft charges for its existing 13-inch Surface Pro 11 with a Snapdragon X Plus inside. As you’ll see below, you’re getting a lot less.\n\nWhat’s new? The smaller sizes, of course, plus new colorways like Ocean and Violet, and a special Slate color for the Surface Pro. The Pro features yet another redesigned keyboard, while the Laptop’s chief selling point is a 16-hour battery life (23 hours for video playback) that Microsoft says is its longest yet. Microsoft is also using these Copilot+ PCs and the X Plus chip’s 45 TOPS as showcases for AI technologies like Recall, Click to Do, and its improved semantic search capabilities, while promising even new AI-powered features for the future — like agentic AI.\n\nMicrosoft is also waving goodbye to the Surface Connect port, the iconic magnetic power connector that defined Surfaces for a decade. Now, Surface is using USB-C ports only for charging and expansion, though there’s an extra USB-A port on the Laptop for legacy connections.\n\nIt’s hard to look at those prices and not think “tariffs,” though that’s not the word Microsoft executives are focusing upon. “We think that these new Surface Pro and Surface Laptops are for a set of customers for whom affordability is going to be important,” Pavan Davuluri, the corporate vice president for Windows and Devices, told reporters.\n\n“Tariffs are a moving target for us,” Davuluri said. “We don’t have good information yet to share about where we’re going to land” on the topic of tariffs, he added.\n\nKeep in mind, too, that these new devices straddle the commercial and consumer markets. Microsoft executives said that these devices will eventually be offered to businesses, but appear to be sold to just consumers for now. (Only Windows 11 Home is offered, and not Windows 11 Pro.) A Surface Laptop in Violet is probably more suited to a classroom rather than a boardroom, anyway.\n\nSurface Laptop 13-inch: cutting corners\n\nAt 0.61 inches thick and 2.7 pounds, the 13-inch Surface Laptop is the thinnest and lightest Surface Laptop Microsoft has ever created, executives said, with the longest battery life. The existing 13.8-inch Surface Laptop, also with an Snapdragon X Plus chip inside it, weighs 2.96 pounds, while the 15-inch Surface Laptop weighs 3.67 pounds. But Microsoft cut some corners to achieve the low price and smaller display size.\n\nFirst, there’s the processor. Both X Plus chips are not the same: The existing 13.8-inch Surface Laptop 7 includes a 10-core X Plus chip; the new 13-inch Surface Laptop offers an 8-core X Plus chip instead.\n\nMicrosoft’s new Surface Laptop (13-inch) in various color options: Platinum, Ocean, and Violet. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft appears to be offering a single processor option with 16GB of LPDDR5X memory, but the choice of either 256GB or 512GB of removeable storage. Only the 256GB SSD is removeable; the 512GB model uses what’s known as Universal Flash Storage, a lower-power option that in this case appears to be soldered on to the motherboard.\n\nIt’s easy to wonder where the new 13-inch Surface Laptop will fit into Microsoft’s existing Surface clamshell laptop lineup, too. The Surface Laptop Go 3 fizzled out in 2023, though the $799 ($999 as tested) clamshell with a 12.4-inch display certainly lives on in spirit inside the new 13-inch Surface Laptop. Physically, too! The new Surface Laptop carries over the fingerprint sensor that was embedded in the Surface Laptop Go’s power button.\n\nThe Surface Laptop Go 3 was known for its sub-1080p display. The 13-inch Surface Laptop doesn’t go that far, but it offers a 1920 x 1280 display. That’s fine or even better than what you might expect on some cheaper laptops, given the small screen size, but the 178 PPI it offers pales in comparison to the 2304 x 1536 (201 PPI) the 13.8-inch Surface Laptop delivers. The larger Surface Laptop’s display also puts out 600 nits of rated brightness with a refresh rate up to 120Hz; on the 13-inch, expect 400 nits of brightness with a basic 60Hz-refresh rate instead on the newest 13-inch model.\n\nThe Surface Laptop (13-inch) in Ocean. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft refers to the two external USB-C ports as capable of DisplayPort 1.4a with support for up to two 4K displays at 60Hz, but stops short of calling them USB4 or Thunderbolt ports. There’s also a USB-A (USB 3.1) legacy port, too. As noted above, the Surface Connector is gone, which means that you won’t be able to use Surface chargers from earlier laptops any more. Inside the laptop is Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth Core 5.4, however.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 13-inch: specifications\n\nDisplay: 13-inch PixelSense (1920 x 1280 (178 PPI), “strengthened glass” ) up to 60Hz and 10-point multitouch\n\n13-inch PixelSense (1920 x 1280 (178 PPI), “strengthened glass” ) up to 60Hz and 10-point multitouch Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus 8-core\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon X Plus 8-core Graphics: Qualcomm Adreno\n\nQualcomm Adreno NPU: Qualcomm Hexgaon (45 TOPS)\n\nQualcomm Hexgaon (45 TOPS) Memory: 16, 32GB LPDDR5X\n\n16, 32GB LPDDR5X Storage: 256GB SSD, 512GB UFS\n\n256GB SSD, 512GB UFS Ports: 2 USB-C (USB 3.2 w/DisplayPort 1.4a), USB-A 3.1\n\n2 USB-C (USB 3.2 w/DisplayPort 1.4a), USB-A 3.1 Security: Camera (Windows Hello), Fingerprint reader, TPM 2.0 chip\n\nCamera (Windows Hello), Fingerprint reader, TPM 2.0 chip Camera: 1080p (user-facing) with Windows Studio Effects and Windows Hello\n\n1080p (user-facing) with Windows Studio Effects and Windows Hello Battery: 23 hours video playback; 16 hours Web browsing\n\n23 hours video playback; 16 hours Web browsing Wireless: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth Core 5.4\n\nWi-Fi 7, Bluetooth Core 5.4 Operating system: Windows 11 Home\n\nWindows 11 Home Dimensions: 11.25 x 8.43 x 0.61 in.\n\n11.25 x 8.43 x 0.61 in. Weight: 2.7 pounds\n\n2.7 pounds Color: Platinum, Ocean, Violet\n\nPlatinum, Ocean, Violet Price: $899 and up\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch: a new keyboard complements a cheaper look\n\nMicrosoft’s revamped 12-inch Surface Pro is interesting, in part because Microsoft sells the 13-inch Surface Pro with an LCD display, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $799.99 — or did, as Microsoft’s site currently lists it as being sold out. Now, Microsoft is offering the 12-inch Surface Pro at the same minimum price.\n\nAgain, it’s not the same Surface as its predecessors. It too uses the downgraded processor, and the 2196 x 1464 offers a lower pixel density (220 PPI vs 267 PPI) than the existing Surface Pro. It’s protected by “strengthened glass,” without any mention of Gorilla Glass. As you might expect, the former OLED option has gone missing. However, the refresh rate isn’t 60Hz, but 90Hz, which is a cut above what you might expect at the low end.\n\nThe Surface Pro (12-inch) in Violet, with a new dedicated keyboard. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft is offering a configuration with just 16GB of LPDDR5X memory, like the Surface Pro, and the a removeable 256GB of storage or 512GB of UFS storage soldered down. Microsoft’s port choice mimics the Surface Laptop, too, as do the wireless options.\n\nThe Surface Pro’s camera quality decreases, too. Unfortunately, the user-facing camera is now just a generic 1080p option with Windows Hello, instead of the 1440p option Microsoft offered before. Support for AI-powered Windows Studio Effects is still offered, however.\n\nMicrosoft also adjusted the keyboard yet again. A 13-inch Surface Pro would demand its own keyboard, but Microsoft hasn’t chosen to follow the almost ludicrous connectivity of the Surface Pro Flex Keyboard. Instead, Microsoft describes the 13-inch Surface Pro keyboard as one that folds completely flat with the Surface Pro for easier inking and typing, and that features a “customizable precision touchpad with adaptive touch mode.”\n\nThe new Surface Pro can be used with the Surface Slim Pen 2, which now charges when clipped to the back of the tablet.\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Pro (13-inch) tablet.

This rallying cry has long been used by anti-Israel voices, including supporters of terrorist organizations such as Hamas and the PFLP [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine], which seek Israel’s destruction through violent means. It is fundamentally a call for a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, territory that includes the State of Israel, which would mean the dismantling of the Jewish state. It is an antisemitic charge denying the Jewish right to self-determination, including through the removal of Jews from their ancestral homeland.\n\nA doctor at the Duke School of Medicine, alarmed by these publications, told me these Duke Press articles are a form of academic support for terrorism.\n\nIn addition to calling for the destruction of Israel, the 2025 article is attributed to anonymous authors. Duke Press has essentially concealed this “scholarship” so the public can’t see who is calling for the destruction of Israel. Would Duke Press ever publish an anonymous article — or any article — calling for the violent destruction of the Palestinian-controlled territories? I highly doubt it.\n\nThe Ftouni article states: “I would like to thank the editorial team, Samera Esmeir, Susana Draper, and Ramsey McGlazer.”\n\nAll three editors are anti-Israel activists. Esmeir signed a letter “calling on scholars and librarians within Middle East studies to boycott Israeli academic institutions.” Draper and McGlazer signed a letter titled “Academics Boycott Columbia University,” stating, “We endorse and reiterate the demands of the Gaza Solidarity Encampment: divest all of Columbia’s finances, including the endowment, from companies and institutions that profit from Israeli apartheid, genocide and occupation in Palestine.”"}

Battery life", "fullContent": "In 2022-2023, AI-powered PCs made quite a splash with their automatic generation and built-in virtual assistants. Those features are cool, sure, but they’re a little gimmicky at first blush. That said, amid the hype, the real standout feature emerged: battery life. Thanks to smarter resource management and power-efficient chip architecture, AI PCs became long-lasting devices that didn’t need to be plugged in all the time.\n\nLet’s take flying cross-country with a traditional laptop, for instance. You’d probably be anxiously keeping an eye on your battery icon throughout the flight, but with an AI PC you wouldn’t have to think twice about it. The longest-lasting laptop we’ve tested, Lenovo’s ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, delivers nearly 24 hours on a single charge in our testing — and it’s no longer an outlier. Let’s dig into why.\n\nThe heart of efficiency: A smarter, specialized chip\n\nThe new Neural Processing Units (aka the NPU) inside of Copilot+ PCs is where some of the magic happens, as it’s more energy-efficient than a traditional processor with the x86 architecture. CPUs and GPUs can be a massive drain on a laptop’s battery, especially if both are active at the same time. They also aren’t optimized for AI tasks.\n\nThe NPU is different from a traditional processor in that it’s a specialized hardware chip that runs AI workloads like image recognition and real-time language translation. Offloading these intensive jobs allows the CPU and GPU to idle more often, effectively cutting down on power consumption.\n\nThe NPU also gets a nice boost from its architecture, which uses parallel processing and lower clock speeds. Parallel processing allows the NPU handle multiple tasks simultaneously instead of completing them one at a time. By breaking these tasks into smaller chunks and then executing them at the same time, the laptop can return to idle mode more quickly, thus conserving energy. As for the clock speed, a lower one consumes less power than a higher one. The less power the NPU uses, the longer the battery lasts.\n\nSnapdragon X and the rise of CPU efficiency\n\nAnother game-changer is Arm-based Snapdragon processor, which uses high-performance cores built using decades of mobile-focused energy enhancements–this is what makes them so efficient and consume less power. In fact, they’re so efficient we’ve seen one AI PC last up to 24 hours on a single charge. That sort of longevity means that the laptop should last an entire work or school day, with extra juice to spare.\n\nthis snapdragon laptop can last 24 hours Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 Read our review\n\nThese processors know how to handle idle time, too. So, when a laptop isn’t being used, the processor enters an ultra-low power mode, so it shouldn’t waste much, if any, energy.\n\nIntel’s rival “Lunar Lake” laptops, which arrived hot on the heels of Snapdragon X with its own NPU in tow, also deliver delightfully long battery life.\n\nThe key with Lunar Lake is how the chip uses its “Performance” cores for demanding jobs (3D design or video rendering) and “Efficient” cores for lighter tasks (checking e-mail or playing music). The switching between these cores depends on the type of workload. This allows the system to deliver just the right amount of processing power when needed, so it shouldn’t waste power on simpler tasks, resulting in a smooth multitasking experience as well as improved energy conservation.\n\nMeanwhile, while AMD’s latest chips focus more on driving performance, Ryzen laptops have increased their endurance significantly over the last year. Sure, the parallel-processing NPU might pick up slack, but a large part of this exciting leap-forward in laptop battery life is being driven by improvements to overall CPU efficiency.\n\nAI-driven software optimization\n\nIt’s not just the hardware that’s impressive–AI-driven software optimization plays a big part as well. At the crux, it intelligently manages how the system uses resources.\n\nFor example, instead of constantly syncing files to the cloud like with OneDrive or Google Drive, an AI PC can reduce the syncing frequency when it’s on battery power or schedules it for moments when the laptop isn’t in use. The software also suppresses unnecessary notifications from social apps and shuts down background processes that haven’t been used in a while. It’s basically designed to adapt to your unique usage patterns and learning your daily habits.\n\nAI can even protect your battery’s health with something called “Intelligent Charging.” It does this by learning your routine; it’ll slow down charging overnight or stop the battery from charging at the 80-85 mark (if you keep your laptop plugged in overnight). The reason for this cap is because lithium-ion batteries degrade faster when they’re constantly charged to 100 percent. Plus, AI can even monitor the internal temperature of your machine, slowing down the charge if things get too hot. Heat can increase energy consumption and shorten a battery’s lifespan.\n\nLooking ahead: A more power-efficient future\n\nWith NPUs, CPUs, and machine learning constantly evolving, we’re heading towards a future where bad battery life is a thing of the past. The combination of smarter hardware and software will only improve with time–I’m confident in this. If you’re tired of constantly monitoring your battery, it might be time to welcome this new wave of AI-powered PCs with open arms."}

The nonprofit tests several types of smart home devices, including their security and privacy.\n\nAppleInsider has a storied history with the publication, stemming from an observed anti-Apple bias with its MacBook Pro and HomePod recommendations in 2017.\n\nAfter some back and forth, AppleInsider was invited to visit the Consumer Reports facilities in New York. We walked through their data-driven testing procedures that at the time, didn't value design or cohesive ecosystem elements.\n\nEight years later, now on amicable terms, we get into the work that Consumer Reports does after the news, including how it decides what devices to test, how it measures their security, and how it helps inform consumers about smart home platforms and standards.\n\nPlus, we have some fun talking about Samsung's latest fridge. The new fridge touts AI-capabilities that may not be as accurate as it hoped in tracking your food.\n\nThe full interview is transcribed below and edited for clarity.\n\nIn the news, Eufy launched its latest smart home vacuum. The Omni E28 is a Matter-enabled robotic vacuum but the top has a removable deep clean wet vac for cleaning your carpets and upholstery.\n\nGovee also announced its new outdoor \"branch\" lights. These path lights are available only in the EU but have full color control and IP66 resistance rating with Matter support.\n\nBird Buddy has launched its newest Kickstarter, raising money to fund the production of its Petal camera and WonderBlocks habitat. It also has its own optional local hub for processing, instead of relying on cloud services.\n\nFinally, we get into Find My-enabled wallets, includes ESR's Boost Wallet that supports up to 5 cards and 3 bills. Despite so many options out there, the your host's ideal wallet has yet to be released.\n\nInterview with Dan Wroclawski from Consumer Reports\n\nAndrew O'Hara: Let's talk about Consumer Reports and all the stuff you get into. I find this stuff super fascinating.\n\nSo tell me a little bit, just in general, about how you got to Consumer Reports. And yeah, let's start talking about your testing process for smart home devices.\n\nDan Wroclawski: I've been with CR now for seven and a half years, which is kind of mind-blowing. But it's just a great place to work. It's really good if you want to have a family, and it's nice working for a mission-driven organization— not just one solely focused on making money.\n\nWe do a lot of advocacy work. When we find problems with products, we go to the manufacturer and try to get them to fix them. It's just a really rewarding place to be.\n\nFor CR, I cover a bunch of different things. Smart home is one of them, but I also do refrigerators, home security— and I just randomly got dash cams, of all things. So I'll be diving into that world soon.\n\nAndrew O'Hara: I was going to say— fridges, smart fridges cool. That's smart home. Security systems, too.\n\nDan Wroclawski: Yeah, I still count that as smart home. And dash cams— I think the thought was, I'm the home security guy, so that's like security-adjacent. But yeah, I do a lot of fun stuff.\n\nIn terms of smart home, we can't test everything under the sun because we already test thousands of products every year, and the market is so much bigger than that. So we really have to pick and choose efficiently.\n\nWe focus on things like smart thermostats, smart locks, security cameras, video doorbells, robotic vacuums, smoke and CO detectors. We also do smart TVs, streaming players, and soundbars— though that falls more under our TV team.\n\nAndrew O'Hara: I have many questions. Here's a general one: you have all these categories, but how do you determine which specific models to focus on? Take robotic vacuums— there are a million.\n\niRobot alone has released nine new ones this year, and it's only May. Then there's Roborock, Ecovacs, SwitchBot and that's not even counting infomercial brands like Shark. So how do you narrow it down?\n\nDan Wroclawski: Great question. We actually have a whole team of market analysts whose job is to assess the marketplace for different product categories. They decide, based on retail placement and sales data, what brands and models the majority of people are buying. That's what we try to focus on.\n\nWe can't cover everything — it's just not possible. The testing takes a lot of time and money. But we try to get a sample that represents what people will actually see when they go shopping— whether it's on Amazon, at Best Buy, Walmart, or Target.\n\nFor robotic vacuums, that means covering the latest iRobot models, Roborock, Shark, and some of the others that dominate shelf space and customer interest.\n\nAnd even beyond that— we don't do this for robot vacuums, but I can tell you about refrigerators— we conduct national surveys and member surveys. We use that data to create brand-level ratings based on reliability and satisfaction.\n\nAndrew O'Hara: So even if someone's looking at a fridge that isn't directly reviewed, they can still use your data to make a decision?\n\nDan Wroclawski: Exactly. Like with refrigerators, we have maybe 250 to 350 fridges currently in our ratings— don't quote me on that— but that's still just a fraction of what's on the market. The brand-level scores help fill in the gaps.\n\nFor example, if LG scores well for top-freezer fridges, and you're considering an LG that we haven't reviewed, at least you know the brand has a strong track record.\n\nAndrew O'Hara: Okay, that makes sense. I want to come back to fridges later— especially Samsung's AI fridge— but let's look generally at smart home ecosystems. Some consumers don't care, but for others, it totally changes their experience.\n\nIf you're in Apple Home or Google Home, you're going to ignore anything outside that vertical. Do you help guide users in that way? And how does that factor into your scoring, especially with Matter making things more complex?\n\nDan Wroclawski: It's not a huge scoring factor, but we do account for it. For categories like thermostats, locks, and security cameras, we list which ecosystems the product supports— Amazon's assistant, Google Home, Apple Home— on the review pages under \"features and specs.\"\n\nSometimes we'll even note if a smart platform integration is a paid feature, which does happen and is annoying. That might impact the smart features score a bit.\n\nBut really, our core focus is still the mass-market consumer, and that audience hasn't fully embraced smart home tech— yet. It's improving, and Matter should help, but adoption has been slow.\n\nWe do allow filtering by ecosystem, though. So you can go to the ratings page for smart locks and filter for \"Apple Home\" compatibility, for example, and just see the models that work within your ecosystem.\n\nIt's something we want to improve on, because with Matter, everything is becoming more connected. It's definitely on our radar.\n\nAndrew O'Hara: True. And I feel like you have more responsibility than I do. My audience— whether it's HomeKit Insider or AppleInsider— already cares about HomeKit and Matter. It's easy for me to narrow the focus.\n\nAndrew: Everything I cover is basically going to be that, but for you, like you said, it's just that wide audience. Most of them don't know what Matter is, but I feel like it's your reviews they're going to read that are going to have to explain to them why they should know what it is and why it should be important and what it means.\n\nI mean, you know, from listening to the show, you've talked so many times that Matter has kind of a branding problem — like, what is it? Who knows!\n\nYou go into the store and things say \"Matter\" on the box, but no one knows what that means, and they're doing very little to improve that. So I feel like right now the only way customers know is from reading reviews and kind of pushing that news out there.\n\nDan: Yeah, I mean, it's a big problem. We do try to — I don't want to say promote — but educate our readers on all these different smart home integrations. We generally note them in all the reviews. We have buying guides for all these different product categories, and we'll talk about these features in those guides.\n\nAnd yeah, we do try to educate our readers. I have a big, long Matter guide explaining all the nitty-gritty — what Matter is, what it works with, what devices it supports, and all that useful stuff. Because yeah, it's a lot, and it's a lot for the average consumer to take in.\n\nAndrew: For sure. One of the big things people are always curious about — fortunately, HomeKit stuff is very locked down — but when you get into like Amazon, the certification process is a little more lax. How do you quantify and test things like security and vulnerabilities there?\n\nI mean, when we're looking at locks and some of those, you've got to do something. So how do you do security?\n\nDan: Yeah, so we have a dedicated team that solely does privacy and security testing on a bunch of products. Right now, it's mainly security cameras and doorbells, robotic vacuums, smart TVs, streaming media players like Apple TV, and Wi-Fi routers.\n\nWe follow something called The Digital Standard, which is a testing standard that CR and a bunch of other advocacy groups helped create. There's a privacy and a security portion to it.\n\nFor privacy, we look at all the documentation for a product and a brand — privacy policies, terms of service, other documentation — and collect it all. We hunt it down because it's not always easy to find. And we do the reading that everyone is told to do and never does.\n\nWe use that to understand: What are they doing with your data? Are they selling it? Are they using it to improve their products? All that kind of stuff. We then turn that into a data privacy score.\n\nFor security, we test if the product is using encryption. We do penetration testing to look for vulnerabilities. We've actually found some. There was a pretty egregious no-name video doorbell last year being sold on Amazon and Walmart that was very easy to hack.\n\nIf there's a vulnerability, we try to work with the brand to fix it. We note that in articles or reviews to make people aware. Most devices we find are actually fairly secure — that's good. It's privacy that's quite lacking, even with some Apple Home products. Privacy is okay but could be better.\n\nSo yeah, it's a great resource, and I don't think anyone else really does that kind of work.\n\nAndrew: On the Apple Home side of things for privacy — like with Eve, for example, since we talk about them a lot — every Apple Home product, you can use it solely with the Apple Home app. How much do those privacy concerns still come into play if you're not using the brand's app? Like, if you just scan and go?\n\nDan: That's a really fair point. That's a great strategy to avoid privacy and security problems. HomeKit is very secure and private, which is great. If you solely use it through Apple Home and don't have to download the app — which sometimes you do, just to get the code, especially with Matter — that's a more secure and private route.\n\nIf the code is on the device and you can just use it directly with Apple Home, that's better.\n\nAndrew: How do you feel as someone who tests all of these things about cameras on robotic vacuum cleaners? I have mixed feelings. I like the idea of a roving security guard — we had an attempted break-in years ago, so we're very security conscious now — but I also don't love the idea of a robot roaming and recording everything.\n\nDan: I'm not a huge fan either. I'm not a huge fan of cameras in the home in general unless they have privacy covers. I do need them — I have little kids and need to know what happened when something goes wrong.\n\nBut I go only with models that have privacy covers so I can turn them off when I don't want them recording.\n\nAndrew: When I tested the Roborock S8, they ditched the camera — then brought it back. I missed it! It would take a photo when it encountered something unusual, and that was helpful. And I liked using it to find the dog or monitor the vacuum remotely.\n\nMy wife is wary about cameras, so we don't have them in bedrooms, etc. But I liked that Roborock requires you to manually enable the camera — holding buttons on the bot, setting a passcode. It can't be remotely accessed, unlike some other brands. I feel like that's progress.\n\nDan: That's smart implementation. There are good use cases. Object detection is one. iRobot used to talk about detecting animal droppings and navigating around them. That's probably harder to do with LiDAR than with vision-based AI.\n\nAndrew: Let's wrap up and talk about fridges. I'm curious about your take. On one hand, adding AI and cameras seems silly for a major appliance — it's expensive, should last years, and could get outdated fast.\n\nBut I've been in the grocery store and loved being able to look inside via the Samsung app. Plus, my daughter redecorates the fridge screen monthly with a collage of photos — it's fun!\n\nSo I'm torn. There's privacy, unnecessary cost, short software lifespan... what do you think?\n\nDan: It's tough. They do have some fun and useful features. Even using the screen as a kitchen TV is nice. But yes, fridges are expected to last at least a decade, and Samsung has already stopped providing updates to some Family Hub models that were only 5-6 years old. That's only half the fridge's life.\n\nSo I'd caution people. Think about whether you really want that. It likely won't be supported for the fridge's lifespan.\n\nThe internal cameras are helpful — like when you're grocery shopping. I tested one of the Bespoke AI fridges that can ID food and log expiration dates. It worked about 50% of the time. It struggled with packaged items, but did okay with clear containers — like a container of strawberries.\n\nAndrew: What about the crisper drawers? Are there cameras inside?\n\nDan: No, but it can see through clear drawers — just the front. It depends on the model. One has three side cameras. The newer one has an overhead camera that records as you put items in. But the angle isn't great — I found myself having to \"show\" the item to the camera as I placed it inside. No one will do that.\n\nIt also doesn't see what's on the door shelves or off to the sides. It's a cool idea, and I think it will work one day. But it needs more cameras and a lot of improvement.\n\nAndrew: I have one of those older models. Probably lost support already! It's supposed to ID items but often gets them wrong — like telling me I put in tamales, grape tomatoes, and dog food... when I didn't. But man, I want that to work.\n\nImagine just asking the fridge, \"What should I make?\" and it tells you based on what's inside. That'd be awesome.\n\nDan: Yeah, that's the dream. It could cut down on food waste and save money. That would be really useful. But it'll take more cameras, more smarts, and it doesn't even address the freezer yet!\n\nAndrew: Exactly. Also, these things need better processors. They cheap out on it because no one knows what chip is inside a fridge. Then new features can't be supported. Mine freezes sometimes just trying to animate the screen shake when I close the door.\n\nIf you're paying $2,000+, spend a bit more on a decent processor. Especially if it's supposed to last 10 years.\n\nDan: I agree. They're underpowered. And margins are tight, so they try to cut costs where they can. But that shortchanges consumers long term. They need to think bigger.\n\nAndrew: Well, I feel like we could keep chatting forever, but we should wrap up. Anything you want to leave us with, Dan?\n\nDan: Just that Consumer Reports is a great resource — whether you're looking for home appliances, tech, baby gear, or cars. I'm really trying to make it a great smart home resource with reviews and content for everyone. So check it out. And don't forget the promo code at cr.org/homekitinsider — it's a great deal, and you'll probably make back your money in product savings.\n\nAndrew: Awesome. Thanks so much for hanging out, Dan.

These are nine paying video game markets open to freelance article pitches and submissions.\n\nRetro Format\n\nRetro Format is a magazine devoted to old video games and consoles. This magazine is open to pitches for retro computer, console, and game feature articles typically more than 2,000 words in length.

You can pitch articles to Geek Native via the contact form on the page linked below.\n\nGames Industry.biz\n\nThe Games Industry.biz website is primarily for industry professionals and developers rather than gaming consumers.

However, the remuneration offered can vary based on the article types submitted. This website also requests to see portfolios (samples) from first-time contributors in pitches. The email address for pitching articles to Games Industry.biz is contact@gamesindustry.biz.\n\nUnwinnable\n\nUnwinnable is a website and magazine open to freelance pitches for video game, comic, movie, and TV-related articles.

Unwinnable offers $15–$25 for shorter Exploit essays and website story pieces. The three email addresses for pitching game articles to Unwinnable are:\n\nRPG Site\n\nRPG Site is a website devoted to the role-playing game genre for all gaming platforms.

The website’s freelance rates for preview articles start at $300. For short news pieces, IGN offers a $30 base rate and $300–$400 for deeper investigative reports. To get in touch with IGN for pitching, you’ll need to fill out a form about pitched submissions on that site’s freelance page.\n\nwww.corp.ign.com/freelance-opportunities-and-guidelines\n\nOuterhaven\n\nThe Outerhaven website covers the latest console, PC, and virtual reality games. This site is looking for guide (tip) articles that cover newer games, like Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Doom: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, and The First Berserker.

The site’s editorial promises to reply to pitches whether accepted or not.\n\nThe Restart editorial specifies an average rate of $200 for articles added to the site. However, the exact remuneration offered is determined by article type. This site asks for at least two article samples to be shown when pitching. You can send pitches to Brandy Berthelson at the brandy@moonrock.biz email address.\n\nPolygon\n\nPolygon is an entertainment website that covers video games, movies, TV, comics, and books. This site’s submission page provides detailed pitching guidelines but is a little vague about what type of gaming articles Polygon is inclined to include. However, Polygon is generally open to pitches for op-eds, essays, and other original reporting about video games.\n\nPolygon doesn’t specify exactly what it pays for articles included but confirms it offers competitive rates. The website’s editorial will discuss the remuneration offered if your pitch is accepted. This website has a videogames@polygon.com email address for pitching video game article titles.\n\nThe digital and print publications above could be good starting points for breaking into video game article writing. They’re markets to which you can pitch and submit numerous video game article types, be it guide, feature, review, retro, news, or preview. Their rates vary considerably, with the bigger websites generally offering higher remuneration."}

As you can see in the screenshot examples above, it does a beautiful job of reverting many of the app’s assets back to the original, such as the Twitter bird in the news feed header, the Twitter bird app icons, and the Tweet button, among other things.\n\nIn addition to the branding reverts, NeoFreeBird gives you all kinds of Twitter Blue-like features at no cost, which drives a hard bargain for the nostalgic ones out there who want the old-fashioned Twitter experience in 2025.\n\nNeoFreeBird also comes with a slew of options to configure, which we’ll show you below:\n\nThings you can do here include:\n\nGeneral\n\nEnable or disable Voice Tweets\n\nRemove Tweets tied to suggested topics\n\nRemove suggested topics\n\nRequire biometric authentication to open Twitter\n\nUse an external browser instead of the Twitter app to open links\n\nCustomize links and remove tracking features\n\nPick a custom URL\n\nTweets\n\nDisable the compact Tweet style\n\nEnable or disable long-press to share or export Tweets as images\n\nShow Tweet source labels\n\nConfirm before liking Tweets\n\nConfirm before posting Tweets\n\nHide views under Tweets\n\nRemove the bookmark button from Tweets\n\nHide sensitive content warnings\n\nProfiles\n\nConfirm before following someone\n\nCopy usernames, bios, and more with one tap\n\nTranslate bios to another language\n\nDisable “Who to Follow”\n\nMerge the Photos and Videos tabs into one\n\nHide the Articles tab in profiles\n\nHide the Highlights tab in profiles\n\nSearch\n\nDisable Twitter search history\n\nRemove all trending videos from the search menu\n\nPhotos and videos\n\nDisable video captions\n\nEnable high-quality media uploading and viewing mode\n\nEnable or disable large images\n\nTwitter Blue\n\nEnable or disable undo Tweet\n\nEnable or disable downloading media from Tweets\n\nEnable or disable saving Photos directly to the Photos app\n\nRemove all Twitter ads\n\nRemove the ‘Get Verified’ and ‘Upgrade’ buttons\n\nChange the Twitter app theme\n\nChange the Twitter app icon\n\nEdit the tab bar\n\nLayout\n\nEnable or disable custom messages backgrounds for direct messages\n\nHide the Spaces bar\n\nKeep the tab bar visible when scrolling\n\nUse the left-to-right layout even for right-to-left languages\n\nAlways show the scroll bar\n\nEnable or disable custom fonts\n\nAs you can see, there’s a lot being offered in the NeoFreeBird app, and it evokes a lot of the classic features that Twitter once had before the 𝕏 re-brand.\n\nThose who want to give NeoFreeBird a try can download the .ipa file from the project’s GitHub page and then sideload it with AltStore or perma-sign it with TrollStore. From there, you’ll need to sign in with your existing 𝕏 account, and it will be as if you were still using the Twitter app before the re-brand.\n\nAre you planning to take advantage of NeoFreeBird, or have you resigned to the new 𝕏 app and its features in 2025?

Whether in the transfer market or on the pitch, they act with the decisiveness of a club used to getting what it wants. That’s why the story, first reported by AS, that they’re offering Liverpool a “symbolic amount” to fast-track Trent Alexander-Arnold’s transfer speaks volumes—not about the fee, but about the urgency.\n\nHaving already announced he will leave Anfield at the end of his contract in June 2025, Alexander-Arnold’s early departure is now the subject of Madrid’s focus. The Spanish giants want him available for the expanded FIFA Club World Cup kicking off in mid-June. Yet under his current deal, he cannot play until July 1st.\n\nSo Real have moved. They’ve reportedly offered Liverpool around €900,000 (£760,000), along with covering the England international’s final month of wages. The total financial package edges towards €2m (£1.7m)—a paltry figure for a player of his stature, but the reward on offer for Madrid justifies the logic.\n\nWorld Stage Beckons: Club World Cup as Launchpad\n\nThe backdrop for this sudden negotiation is the Club World Cup, an increasingly lucrative platform. Madrid are set to earn $38.2m (£28.6m) just by participating, with an additional $87.6m (£65.5m) available should they reach the final. The mathematics are simple: securing Alexander-Arnold’s services early increases their chances of winning and multiplies the return.\n\nTheir group opponents—Al Hilal, Pachuca and RB Salzburg—might not send shivers down spines, but Madrid want their squad intact and firing. Alexander-Arnold’s creativity and elite ball progression could be a decisive edge, especially in matches where opposition sides sit deep and disrupt.\n\nLiverpool’s Perspective: Farewell on Their Own Terms\n\nLiverpool have stated Alexander-Arnold will depart once his contract expires on 30 June 2025. The phrasing, deliberately official and firm, suggests reluctance to release him before that point. Yet the symbolic gesture could be tempting. It would offer closure, a clean break, and a chance for fans to begin adjusting to life without one of their own.\n\nStill, it’s a difficult scenario. How do you place a value on 20 years of service, a local lad turned Champions League winner, now walking into the Bernabéu?\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a Liverpool supporter’s perspective, this is less about heartbreak and more about pragmatism. The reality is, Trent Alexander-Arnold’s time at Anfield is already done. His departure this summer has been confirmed, so the idea of him leaving a few weeks earlier than planned shouldn’t come as a massive shock.\n\nWhat’s striking, though, is the price tag. €900,000? That barely scratches the surface of Trent’s true value, even if he’s technically out of contract. Still, when you consider the circumstances—his deal ending in June and Real Madrid’s desire to have him ready for the Club World Cup—it starts to make sense. From Liverpool’s perspective, accepting a modest fee and having his wages covered for the final month isn’t the worst outcome.\n\nIn truth, this feels like the first quiet step in a new era. Arne Slot won’t have Trent in his squad either way, so this early exit simply clears the path a bit sooner."}

Th… [+2840 chars]", "title": "Report: Premier League rivals eye £50m move for Liverpool midfielder", "fullContent": "Harvey Elliott’s Summer Dilemma: Wolves Eye £50m Liverpool Midfielder\n\nWolves Target Liverpool’s ‘Fearless’ Prospect\n\nLiverpool could be braced for a summer of tough decisions, with reports from GiveMeSport suggesting that Wolves are preparing a move for Harvey Elliott. The 22-year-old has long been seen as a symbol of Liverpool’s future – a creative talent with a sharp footballing brain and fearless streak, as writer Leanne Prescott aptly put it. Yet his struggle for consistent starts under Arne Slot has opened a door, and Wolves seem ready to knock.\n\nDespite Elliott’s own desire to remain at Anfield – “I’d like to spend the rest of my career with the Reds” – opportunity may tempt. Wolves reportedly want to make him “the centrepiece of their plans,” a promise of regular football that’s hard to ignore for a player restricted mostly to cameo roles. His only Premier League start this season came in the heavily rotated defeat at Chelsea.\n\nLiverpool’s Valuation and FSG’s Track Record\n\nLiverpool’s £50m valuation for Elliott is both a deterrent and a statement. It’s not a figure Wolves can take lightly, even if they free up funds by selling key players like Matheus Cunha. But FSG have form here. The club’s owners have previously cashed in on fringe or academy talents – Harry Wilson, Neco Williams, Fabio Carvalho – when decent fees were offered.\n\nThe difference this time is scale. Elliott isn’t a peripheral figure. He’s played nearly 150 games for the club, scored memorable winners against Crystal Palace and PSG, and earned trust in high-pressure situations. His sale wouldn’t just be about balance sheets – it would be a sporting gamble.\n\nSquad Role Versus Star Billing\n\nSlot’s intentions are still being shaped, but Elliott’s role under the manager looks to be one of rotation. In a Liverpool side that wants to chase silverware on all fronts, depth matters. Selling Elliott – a player who knows the system, the club, and the pressure – could backfire if not carefully weighed.\n\nThat said, from the player’s view, the appeal of regular starts in an attacking Wolves team might be the development path he needs. As with many modern transfers, the decision could rest as much with the player’s ambitions as the club’s valuation.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a Liverpool supporter’s perspective, this report hits a nerve. Harvey Elliott is the kind of player you want to see succeed in red. He’s grown with the club, spoken like a fan, and delivered big moments – even if he’s yet to cement himself in the starting XI.\n\nThe thought of him becoming the “centrepiece” at another Premier League club stings, especially one like Wolves, who are building but still a tier below the elite. If Liverpool are serious about competing across Europe, players like Elliott – who can step in and change a game – are essential.\n\nThere’s a fair argument that £50m is good business, but not if it leaves a hole in the squad’s creativity and spirit. He’s a rare blend of technique, character, and crowd connection. Letting him go shouldn’t even be considered unless it’s for a massive fee and a clear upgrade is ready to walk through the door."}

Arne Slot opted for significant squad rotation to appease the calls of some of the fanbase, making six changes from the previous match, including resting key midfielders Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai. This altered lineup struggled to find rhythm and cohesion, which Chelsea capitalised on to secure a 3-1 victory.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/anfieldedition/status/1919352545954111521?s=46&t=rxgukmqdoXc4muVFLSx2EQ\n\nThe Starting Elevens\n\nChelsea:\n\n• GK – Robert Sánchez\n\n• RB – Moisés Caicedo\n\n• CB – Trevoh Chalobah\n\n• CB – Levi Colwill\n\n• LB – Marc Cucurella\n\n• CM – Roméo Lavia\n\n• CM – Enzo Fernández (c)\n\n• RW – Noni Madueke\n\n• CAM – Cole Palmer\n\n• LW – Pedro Neto\n\n• CF – Nicolas Jackson\n\nLiverpool:\n\n• GK – Alisson Becker\n\n• RB – Trent Alexander-Arnold\n\n• CB – Virgil van Dijk (c)\n\n• CB – Jarell Quansah\n\n• LB – Kostas Tsimikas\n\n• CM – Wataru Endo\n\n• CM – Curtis Jones\n\n• CM – Harvey Elliott\n\n• RW – Mohamed Salah\n\n• CF – Diogo Jota\n\n• LW – Cody Gakpo\n\nSubstitutes:\n\nConor Bradley – Trent Alexander Arnold – 58’\n\nDarwin Nunez – Diogo Jota – 58’\n\nAlexis Mac Allister – Wataru Endo – 69’\n\nDominic Szoboszlai – Harvey Elliott – 69’\n\nFederico Chiesa – Kostas Tsimikas – 82’\n\nGoals (Assisted by)\n\nChelsea 1 – 0 Liverpool\n\nEnzo Fernández (Pedro Neto) – 3’\n\nChelsea 2 – 0 Liverpool\n\nOwn Goal by Jarell Quansah (Cole Palmer cross) – 56’\n\nLiverpool 2 – 1 Chelsea\n\nVirgil van Dijk (Harvey Elliott corner) – 85’\n\nChelsea 3 – 1 Liverpool\n\nCole Palmer (penalty) – 90+6’\n\nMatch Statistics\n\nPossession – Chelsea 35% – 65% Liverpool\n\nXG – Chelsea 2.91 – 1.17 Liverpool\n\nTotal Shots – Chelsea 17 – 11 Liverpool\n\nShots on Target – Chelsea 7 – 2 Liverpool\n\nCorners – Chelsea 3 – 6 Liverpool\n\nFouls – Chelsea 12 – 10 Liverpool\n\nYellow Cards – Chelsea 2 – 2 Liverpool\n\nSaves – Chelsea 1 – 5 Liverpool\n\nFirst Half\n\nChelsea commenced the match with high intensity, pressing Liverpool’s rotated lineup from the outset. Within three minutes, Enzo Fernández capitalised on a well-placed cutback from Pedro Neto to give the Blues an early lead and it stemmed from a loose pass from Curtis Jones. Liverpool struggled to establish control, with their midfield lacking the usual cohesion. Despite dominating possession, the Reds failed to create significant scoring opportunities in the first half. The lack of desire and intensity was almost predictable, especially with so many pieces coming in that had little cohesion with the first-team elite.\n\nThe half ended with Liverpool one goal behind and not showing any signs of being able to compete.\n\nSecond Half\n\nNo changes were made by Arne Slot as he kept faith with those starting assets which had underwhelmed in the first half.\n\nLiverpool attempted to assert themselves after the break, but a defensive mishap in the 56th minute saw Jarell Quansah inadvertently deflect a Cole Palmer cross into his net, doubling Chelsea’s advantage. Virgil van Dijk provided a glimmer of hope for Liverpool with a well-taken header from a Harvey Elliott corner in the 85th minute, as he was a constant threat from set pieces. However, any chances of a comeback were extinguished in stoppage time when Cole Palmer converted a penalty, awarded after Quansah fouled Moisés Caicedo in the box.\n\nThe Blues were good value for their win and the Reds maintained a 15-point lead at the top of the Premier League standings.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/anythinglfc_/status/1919474288043622628?s=46&t=rxgukmqdoXc4muVFLSx2EQ\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nYou got the sense that a point was being made here, in that the depth of the squad simply isn’t old enough to warrant inclusion. Harvey Elliott was weak and irrelevant, Curtis Jones was lacklustre and wasteful, Trent Alexander Arnold was poor and disinterested, whereas Diogo Jota seemed intent on producing yet another ineffective display.\n\nThe first team elite will return next Sunday as Arsenal will travel to Anfield, as the backup assets once again take their seats on the sidelines and watch as the summer rolls into regeneration.\n\nSteven Smith’s Score Prediction:\n\nChelsea 1 – 2 Liverpool"}

For Liverpool and Arne Slot, fresh from a triumphant first campaign at Anfield, left-back appears to be one of the positions under close scrutiny. In a recent Anfield Index podcast, David Lynch, speaking to Dave Davis, offered intriguing insight into Liverpool’s transfer thinking — and particularly their interest in Milos Kerkez and Rayan Aït-Nouri.\n\nSlot’s Tactical Influence Already Reshaping Recruitment\n\nOne of the most striking developments of Slot’s debut season has been his tactical clarity. Known for favouring technical, high-intensity football with full-backs who are as comfortable in midfield zones as they are in wide channels, it’s no surprise that Liverpool are assessing their options in that department.\n\nLynch made it clear that while Kerkez is a serious consideration, things are far from settled:\n\n“I can guarantee that Liverpool like him and that they’ve watched him very closely and there’s a lot of aspects there that they would admire but I would push back on the idea that it’s definitely going to be him.”\n\nThe keyword here is “admire” — Liverpool’s admiration for Kerkez isn’t necessarily a sign of an impending move, but rather a testament to how thorough the recruitment process is. Under Slot, the role of a full-back may demand even greater tactical flexibility, making the profile more complex than ever.\n\nRayan Aït-Nouri: A Better Fit for Slot’s System?\n\nWhile Kerkez might have drawn the early headlines, Lynch believes fans should look elsewhere:\n\n“Keep an eye out for Rayan Ait-Nouri because people are forgetting how many boxes he ticks.”\n\nThere’s a reason this line stands out. Aït-Nouri, with over 100 Premier League appearances at just 23 years old, represents not only proven experience but stylistic suitability. Lynch adds:\n\n“He’s still only 23, he’s made over 100 Premier League appearances and seems to be a better fit for what Slot wants from his full-backs.”\n\nIt’s difficult to argue against that. Aït-Nouri’s ability to play inverted, his progressive passing, and his comfort operating in half-spaces are exactly the traits modern managers, particularly those from the Dutch school like Slot, value in a full-back.\n\nIn that sense, the Algerian international may tick more boxes than Kerkez, who, while tenacious and dynamic, is still adapting to Premier League demands.\n\nNo Guarantees, Just Intelligent Scouting\n\nWhile some fans are desperate for early transfer clarity, Lynch reminds us that speculation shouldn’t be confused with certainty:\n\n“Kerkez is on the list and I wouldn’t be shocked if we’re sat here next month and he has signed for Liverpool but just wait and see.”\n\nThis is a smart hedge and a healthy reminder of how elite clubs operate. Liverpool’s recruitment team under Michael Edwards (back in his second spell) and sporting director Richard Hughes are detail-driven. Being “on the list” at Liverpool means a player fits a long-term profile — not necessarily that a transfer is imminent.\n\nThe club’s hierarchy is unlikely to be rushed, particularly when there’s a title to defend and a new European campaign to navigate. Slot’s role in these discussions is pivotal. His blueprint will define how the team evolves, and that blueprint will, in turn, shape who walks through the door.\n\nLeft-Back Position Now Central to Liverpool’s Evolution\n\nThis isn’t just about adding depth — it’s about refreshing a role that’s been instrumental in the Klopp era and now must be reshaped under Slot. Whether it’s Aït-Nouri, Kerkez, or another left-field (pun intended) option, it’s clear Liverpool are hunting for someone who fits the future, not just the present.\n\nAnd in that respect, as David Lynch hints, it’s far more than just a transfer rumour — it’s a tactical decision at the heart of the Slot project."}

That transformation may involve two names making waves at RB Leipzig — Xavi Simons and Benjamin Šeško.\n\nAs reported by David Lynch in conversation with Dave Davis for Anfield Index, there’s growing interest from Liverpool in both players. Lynch explained: “Liverpool definitely like Simons and that’s one to keep an eye on.” That alone will raise eyebrows among Reds supporters who have watched the midfield evolve but perhaps still see a creative void left by the departures of Philippe Coutinho and, more recently, Roberto Firmino’s deeper link-play presence.\n\nXavi Simons: Creativity with Purpose\n\nSimons’ reputation precedes him. Once a YouTube sensation and PSG starlet, he has matured into an electric attacking midfielder who contributed significantly for Leipzig this past season. Lynch notes: “There’s a big chance that he leaves Leipzig this summer because of that agreement in his contract, so that is an interesting one.”\n\nFor Liverpool, that contractual nuance may offer a rare window. Simons could fit into Slot’s flexible forward-midfield hybrid roles, especially if the club opts for rotation and fluidity across the front five. Still only 21, he brings dribbling flair, vision, and positional intelligence — tools that would surely flourish in a high-tempo, possession-based system.\n\nYet there’s always a catch. His role within Slot’s system would require adaptation. Simons isn’t a pressing monster, and whether he could shoulder the defensive responsibility expected of Liverpool midfielders is a valid concern.\n\nBenjamin Šeško: Raw Potential or Risky Project?\n\nWhile Simons may be a more ‘ready-made’ option, Lynch paints a more cautious picture of Benjamin Šeško, despite the Slovenian’s exciting trajectory: “Sesko is a very, very young forward who has scored a lot of goals in a top-five league so it would be weird for Liverpool to not be watching him.”\n\nŠeško, still just 20, is tall, fast, and already making headlines in the Bundesliga. In many ways, he represents a prototype of the modern forward. But Lynch adds a note of realism: “I’d be really surprised and I’m not sure he is the right route to go down when replacing Darwin Núñez.”\n\nThat’s the critical point. With Darwin Núñez himself still very much a work in progress — his inconsistencies well-documented — bringing in another striker who Lynch describes as “still extremely raw in several aspects of his game” might not be the solution. Liverpool don’t need another development project; they need precision additions to a title-winning side.\n\nStrategic Patience or Missed Opportunity?\n\nLiverpool’s transfer strategy has evolved in recent years. Under Michael Edwards and now Richard Hughes, the Reds have leaned into data-driven scouting and long-term planning. The fact that both Simons and Šeško are on the radar suggests the club remains proactive, even amid success.\n\nBut as Lynch wisely observes: “If they want to really nail this signing then I don’t think they’re going to be racing to sign him.” That sentiment captures the careful balancing act Liverpool must now perform — seizing value without undermining stability.\n\nSlot’s first title-winning squad already has quality, but evolution is inevitable. The question is whether Simons and Šeško represent logical progress or an unnecessary gamble. What’s clear is that Liverpool, even in triumph, aren’t resting on their laurels.\n\nOther names like Newcastle United’s Alexander Isak and Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike have also been linked with a switch to Anfield."}

The words of former Bayern Munich technical director Marco Neppe offer a quiet vindication — not just for Liverpool’s recruitment department, but for the idea that growth in football, like in life, is rarely linear.\n\nOnce a misfit in Bavaria and a peripheral figure at Anfield under Jürgen Klopp, Gravenberch has become a symbol of Arne Slot’s transformative impact. Now a Premier League champion, the 22-year-old has not only justified the hype that once surrounded him at Ajax, but surpassed it — with poise, presence and a playing style that echoes the greats.\n\nSlot’s Tactical Rethink Unleashes a Star\n\nIt is no coincidence that Gravenberch’s rise has coincided with the appointment of Arne Slot. The Dutchman’s inclination towards fluid midfield rotations and his trust in technical excellence has given Gravenberch the runway he was denied in Munich. Playing alongside Alexis Mac Allister, he has been both anchor and engine, thriving in a dual role that has accentuated his strengths: ball-carrying, long-stride recoveries, and subtle creativity in the final third.\n\nNeppe reflected on that ability with warmth: “I am super happy for Ryan. He is a special midfielder. When we signed him from Ajax, we were 100% convinced… We knew he would bring it someday.”\n\nIt’s telling that Neppe points to the intangible: patience. “Even in his first season at Liverpool, it was not easy. It is a momentum thing. There are so many stories in football where big careers start because of an injury to another player and they take their chance.”\n\nFrom Fringe to First Name\n\nGravenberch’s current valuation of £170 million feels hyperbolic, yet it underlines his significance to this Liverpool project. A year ago, few would have picked him to become one of the league’s most complete midfielders. But today, he’s arguably one of the first name on the team sheet — ahead of more established figures — and has attracted interest from Europe’s elite.\n\nThis season has offered a redemption arc. No longer burdened by the expectations that once weighed heavily at Bayern, Gravenberch looks unshackled, as if he’s remembered how to enjoy football again. It helps, of course, to be in a title-winning side, but it’s more than just silverware — it’s about trust, responsibility and role clarity.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a fan’s perspective, Ryan Gravenberch’s story this season is pure football poetry. It’s a lesson in patience — for players, coaches, and supporters alike. Many fans questioned the logic behind buying a player who couldn’t get off the bench at Bayern, but the club saw something deeper. Now, it’s all crystal clear.\n\nArne Slot deserves immense credit. He’s turned promise into performance. Gravenberch didn’t just show flashes — he dominated. Big games, tight spaces, high pressure — he never flinched.\n\nBut let’s not get too comfortable. If Real Madrid are circling, Liverpool must act decisively. Secure his future, reward the progress, and make him central to the rebuild. Losing a talent like this now would be unthinkable.\n\nGravenberch isn’t just a project anymore — he’s the prototype for the modern Liverpool midfielder."}

For example, building two or more websites at once. It’s not uncommon to find yourself repeating the same processes. It slows progress and places more burden on your schedule.\n\nEfficiency is the antidote to this kind of chaos. It’s all about finding the right tools and techniques for getting more done with less effort. Thankfully, there are plenty of options out there for busy developers.\n\nThe WordPress ecosystem offers some invaluable tools. There are themes and plugins aimed at speeding up your workflow. And even the Block Editor can boost your efficiency – if you know where to look. Oh, and there’s also the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWe’re all about improving the site-building process without cutting corners. Let’s explore some ways to make it a reality.\n\n\n\nStart Fast With a WordPress Blueprint\n\nDo you find yourself using the same theme and plugins for every project? A WordPress blueprint can save you from repeatedly downloading and installing these items.\n\nThe term “blueprint” can mean different things. Here, we’re talking about a collection of WordPress-related goodies that provide a foundation for your projects. That puts everything you need to start a site build within reach.\n\nFor example, you could combine your trusty starter theme with several plugins. You might include plugins that cover form creation, SEO, and your favorite custom block suite. From there, you can deploy your blueprint when starting a new project.\n\nThere are a few ways to create a blueprint. WordPress has a collection of common blueprints for use with its Playground environment (it also works with WP-CLI). You can also create custom configurations. The advantage is that you’ll always have the latest theme and plugin versions.\n\nIn addition, LocalWP is a local WordPress development environment with blueprint support. You can create a blueprint site that includes your favorite theme and plugins. Once that’s set up, you can create new sites based on your blueprint. It’s handy for those who like to build locally.\n\nThe right blueprint will get your project off to a blazing start. Configure it once and get to work.\n\nUse Block Patterns Everywhere\n\nBlock patterns are a tool to speed up building page layouts. Readymade components like calls to action, pricing tables, or galleries can be added to your page. Block theme users benefit from site header and footer patterns as well.\n\nThat works well on a per-site basis. However, you can also use them across websites. For instance, you can copy and paste from the official Block Pattern Directory.\n\nBut what if you want to use your own custom patterns on multiple sites? There are a few possibilities:\n\nCreate and store patterns locally: Build a local WordPress site to house your custom block patterns. You can copy and paste from the local site into your new projects.\n\nBuild a local WordPress site to house your custom block patterns. You can copy and paste from the local site into your new projects. Store custom patterns on GitHub: Copy your favorite patterns and create GitHub Gists for them. That provides a centralized place to access your patterns and share with others. Copy your pattern’s block code, then paste it into your site’s Block or Site editor.\n\nPatterns can consist of any combination of blocks you like. For best results, keep the styling to a minimum. That allows you to customize the patterns to match your project’s style.\n\nYour custom patterns can be used on every site in your portfolio. You’ll benefit from a faster page-building experience.\n\nKeep Custom Code Snippets Handy\n\nBuilding WordPress websites often means adding custom code. Perhaps you tweaked your theme or changed a plugin’s output. The odds are you’ll need to use those items again. Why not organize them?\n\nLike block patterns, you can build an archive for your code snippets. GitHub is once again a solid option for keeping them on hand. But you can also store them in local files or anywhere that gives you quick access.\n\nYou might also turn some snippets into a custom plugin. It’s helpful for code that performs common tasks. You can install a plugin rather than repeatedly hacking at your theme’s functions.php file.\n\nPro tip: Don’t throw all your snippets into a single plugin. Each plugin’s functionality should be grouped by niche. For example, you might build a plugin that includes WooCommerce tweaks.\n\nAlso, have a plan for maintaining any custom plugins you build. You may need to add or edit their code in the future.\n\nKeeping track of code snippets makes development that much easier. And it beats searching your past projects for that one feature you built.\n\nLet AI Do Some of the Hard Work for You\n\nApps using artificial intelligence (AI) are also a boon to WordPress professionals. They make quick work of common tasks, including complex ones.\n\nTheir ability to generate and troubleshoot code will save you time. Use them to build plugins, squash bugs, and research different approaches. They also serve as a handy reference for WordPress hooks and filters.\n\nThe convenience of these tools goes beyond code. You can also use AI to handle “busy work” that gets in the way of progress. Here are a few ideas:\n\nConvert a spreadsheet to an HTML table;\n\nCreate a summary of a document or blog post;\n\nGenerate charts based on custom data;\n\nGenerate starter content for a page (great for prodding clients to finish content);\n\nIt’s easy to get bogged down with tedious tasks. Experiment with AI tools to improve efficiency and your sanity. You’ll have more time to focus on the important stuff.\n\nStreamline Your WordPress Site Building Workflow\n\nMost often, being efficient isn’t about taking one big step. Rather, it’s a combination of little things that result in a more streamlined approach. The ideas above can get you started on that path.\n\nThe trick is to identify the areas of your workflow that are repetitive or slow you down. From there, you can take steps to improve them. It might be a matter of outsourcing a time-consuming task to AI. Then again, you might benefit from better organizational skills. Either way, there are solutions to help.\n\nImproved efficiency allows you to level up your business. Do more, get paid faster, and avoid being tripped up by the unexpected. It’s a great way to turn your WordPress agency into a well-oiled machine.\n\nWritten by Eric Karkovack Eric Karkovack is a web designer and WordPress expert with over two decades of experience.

高野連前向きな検討日本高野連が指名打者制（ＤＨ制）について来春センバツ大会での導入を視野に検討を進めていることが５日、分かった。「７イニング制など高校野球の諸課題検討会議」では既に議題に挙がっており、昨春の低反発バット導入に続き、２０２６年の高校野球界で新たな改革が施される可能性が出てきた。早ければ来春甲子園のスコアボードに「ＤＨ」の２文字が記されるかもしれない。投手の負担軽減や、打撃を長所とする選手の出場機会が増えるなど多くのメリットがあるとされているＤＨ制。関係者の話によると、来春センバツ大会からの導入を視野に前向きな検討が進められているという。日本高野連は昨年１２月、高校野球を取り巻く状況の変化に対応するため、「７イニング制等高校野球の諸課題検討会議」を設置した。１月１０日に第１回会議が開かれ、当初から課題に挙げられていた７イニング制、リプレー検証の導入可否とともに、ＤＨ制導入についても「検討していく一つの項目と考えている」（井本事務局長）との方針が示された。２０２２年、２３年にＵ－１８日本代表を率いた明徳義塾・馬淵監督が昨夏に「（７イニング制）それよりもＤＨ制が先やと思います」と提言するなど、現場レベルでは導入に前向きな声も多い。また、今年で創設１００年となった東京六大学野球連盟が今春からのＤＨ制導入を決定。そうした中で、月１回のペースで開かれている諸課題検討会議でも、来春センバツ大会を視野に入れた議論が深まっているという。新基準の低反発バットも昨春センバツ大会から導入された経緯があり、ＤＨ制も導入となれば、新学年となる春からの施行が最も現実的な選択肢となる。１００年以上の歴史を持つ高校野球界でまた一つ、大きな改革が進みつつある。\n\n2:

Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nCloud subscriptions that lock your security camera footage behind a monthly fee are a frustrating reality for homeowners. The EufyCam S3 Pro 2-Cam Kit offers a way out. With 4K video resolution, smart AI detection, and solar panels integrated into the two cameras, it delivers top-shelf performance without roping you into a payment plan.\n\nEufy does offer cloud storage as an option, but the cameras in this offering store their recordings locally on Eufy’s HomeBase 3 hub—a NAS box (network-attached storage), essentially—enhancing your privacy while saving you money on subscription fees.\n\nEufyCam S3 Pro cameras with a HomeBase 3 base station are a compelling video-based home-security package.\n\nDesign and features\n\nThe EufyCam S3 Pro cameras have a bullet-style body with a white finish and a black face. Each camera has a solar panel on top, neatly integrated into the design rather than bolted on as an afterthought. It’s a clean, functional look that fits whether you’re mounting them on brick, siding, wood, or stucco.\n\nThe cameras are strongly protected from the elements, boasting a rating of IP67. Our IP code guide tells that means the cameras can not only withstand a blast from a pressure washer (from a reasonable distance), but they can even withstand being submersed in up to three feet of water for up to 30 minutes.\n\nThe Eufy S3 Pro cameras have integrated solar panels that allow them to run all day and night with just an hour of direct sunlight.\n\nMichael Ansaldo/Foundry\n\nThe S3 Pro system is packed with serious hardware. Each camera captures video in 4K Ultra HD resolution (that’s 3840 x 2160 pixels), delivering crisp detail that makes it easy to spot faces, license plates, and other important features. A 135-degree field of view provides wide coverage without the heavy barrel distortion you sometimes get from wide-angle lenses. At night, Eufy’s MaxColor Vision technology kicks in, delivering full-color night vision without needing bright, battery-draining spotlights. Instead, the cameras rely on a larger sensor and wider f/1.0 aperture to pull in enough light naturally.\n\nPowering the system is Eufy’s SolarPlus 2.0 technology. The cameras use a 13,000mAh battery that Eufy says will keep them running for up to a year on a single charge with just an hour of direct sunlight a day. To give homeowners even more flexibility when it comes to mounting the cameras, Eufy offers external solar panels for $29.99 each. You can add one and position it for the best sun exposure even if your ideal camera placement is in permanent shade.\n\nFor motion detection, the S3 Pro pairs radar sensing with conventional passive infrared (PIR) to better separate real threats from moving branches or passing cars. AI-powered recognition also sorts motion events into categories—people, vehicles, pets, and faces—so you’re not constantly bombarded with unnecessary notifications. You can also create privacy zones to block out parts of the frame you don’t want recorded, which is handy if your cameras overlook a neighbor’s property.\n\nThe Eufy Security app provides control over the camera and its live feed as well as the HomeBase 3 hub. Michael Ansaldo/Foundry\n\nThe audio features are just as strong. Two-way audio lets you hear and speak through the cameras, with built-in AI noise reduction that helps voices come through clearly even from 20 to 25 feet away. If you need to scare someone off, each camera also comes equipped with a 100dB siren and customizable voice warnings.\n\nFootage is stored locally on the included Eufy HomeBase 3, which has 16GB of built-in storage. That’s not a lot, but it can be easily expanded up to 16TB by plugging in an internal 2.5-inch SATA hard drive or SSD. A single HomeBase 3 can host up to 16 Eufy cameras, including most Eufy video doorbells and floodlight cameras. And while Eufy doesn’t yet have a robust home security platform beyond its cameras, its NAS box can also monitor Eufy’s motion and door/window sensors. Local storage means no cloud fees, no mandatory subscriptions, and no dependence on third-party servers for your data.\n\nThe HomeBase 3 has dual USB-A ports in back that you can use to charge the cameras and to back up its internal storage. If you want another layer of backup protection, you can sign up for an optional cloud backup service: Eufy’s cloud plans, which start at $0.99 for the first month and $3.99/month after that for a single device. A $13.99/month Plus Plan covers all devices and stores videos for 30 days.\n\nThe S3 Pro works with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit, including HomeKit Secure Video. There is a small tradeoff to using HomeKit, however; video resolution gets capped at 1080p instead of 4K. It’s a limitation that won’t matter to everyone, but it’s worth knowing up front.\n\nSetup and performance\n\nGetting the EufyCam S3 Pro system up and running is about as easy as it gets. The cameras come with everything you need, including sturdy wall mounts and clear instructions that walk you through each step. Simply plug the HomeBase 3 into your router, scan a QR code on the bottom with the Eufy Security app, and follow the prompts to complete the connection. You then press the sync button on each camera to pair it to the HomeBase. Once paired, the HomeBase manages video storage, powers the AI features, and acts as the brains behind the whole setup.\n\nThe Eufy HomeBase 3 network-attached storage device (shown here next to a Ring Alarm Pro with dual battery packs) comes with 16GB of storage for video recordings, but an internal SATA bay can host up to a 16TB hard drive or SSD. Michael Brown/Foundry\n\nIn daylight, the S3 Pro’s video quality stands out. Footage is sharp and vibrant, with colors that look natural instead of overly boosted. Details like faces, clothing, and license plates stay clear even when you zoom in. Motion detection also works well right out of the box (although you can adjust sensitivity to tailor detection to your liking). The combination of radar and infrared sensing does a good job of catching real activity while ignoring typical false alarms like tree branches or passing shadows.\n\nImage quality holds up impressively after dark. Footage stays in color even when streetlights or porch lights are scarce, making it much easier to pick out details like clothing color, car models, or faces that would blur together in a standard black-and-white feed. You don’t need to squint at muddy images or guess what you’re seeing—what’s recorded at night looks almost as sharp and recognizable as daytime footage.\n\nDual USB-A ports on the back of the Eufy HomeBase 3 can be used to make back-up copies of the video recordings stored on the device and to charge the batteries on the cameras if their solar panels don’t get enough sunlight to do the job. Michael Brown/Foundry\n\nUsing the Eufy Security app is smooth and intuitive. Live feeds, recordings, and settings are easy to find, and you can jump between cameras quickly. Notifications arrive promptly and include short AI-powered summaries, so you can tell at a glance whether it’s a person at your door or just your neighbor’s cat wandering by.\n\nThis review is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best home security cameras.\n\nBattery life and solar charging are also strong points. Once installed, the cameras hold their charge steadily, with the built-in panels easily topping off the battery. Placement still matters—put the cameras where they’ll get good light exposure—but if you can’t, the external solar panel is worth considering.\n\nShould you buy the EufyCam S3 Pro 2-Cam Kit?\n\nAt $549.99, the eufyCam S3 Pro 2-Cam Kit offers a compelling package for those seeking high-quality home security without recurring fees. If you’re looking for a reliable, high-quality home security solution that puts you in control of your data and costs, the EufyCam S3 Pro 2-Cam Kit is an easy recommendation. It’s one of the best options out there for buyers who want premium features without getting locked into monthly fees."}

Or, to be shown as evidence in a case like this.\n\nThe following was stated in the relevant court document: \"As Defendant admits in its reply, '[t]here is now no feasible way for [Defendant] to provide the Court with a reviewable form of the [Red War or Osiris] campaigns or to produce them should this matter proceed to discovery.'\"\n\n\"Defendant does not explain how the Court would conduct a side-by-side analysis if it does not have Destiny 2.\"\n\nThe motion to dismiss was denied as a result. \"The Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the elements of an action for copyright infringement,\" said the court.\n\nBungie has been archiving content from Destiny 2 since 2020, as it prioritised new content that's been added to the game with subsequent expansions."}

This doesn’t happen without Trump’s say so.

Trump’s base is indeed rejoicing over his first 100 days, including the projected federal government budget cuts.

It wasn’t my favorite season of the show—I’m happy for Carrie Coon et al., but I’ve moved on, and so has most of the world. So how is this Aimee Lou Wood–Walton Goggins situation still going on?\n\nGoggins and Wood played Rick and Chelsea, respectively, a couple in an age-gap relationship that was perhaps more importantly a rage-gap relationship. Off-screen, viewers of the show took notice that something seemed weird about the dynamic between the two actors around the time the season was ending, in much the same way these things always seem to start these days: by paying a little too much attention to their Instagram presence. Goggins shared a tribute to the series and the two characters on his account, including photos and a very passionate written ode to their love story. He posted a similar series of photos on his Story, soundtracking it with Fleetwood Mac’s “Silver Springs,” which is a wonderful song but one that has, possibly unbeknownst to Goggins, become “a phenomenon in its own right” in recent years, as Slate’s Sam Adams has written: “Silver Springs” is now kind of known as the ultimate anthem for scorned lovers, in addition to carrying the strong whiff of infidelity that Fleetwood Mac always brings. Someone must have alerted Goggins that posting “Silver Springs” online was going to bring on questions, rabid speculation, and possibly even a wellness check, so he changed the song, to “Love” by John Lennon, but the damage was already done. The other big (well, “big”) thing observers took away from the post was that Goggins didn’t tag Wood. Wood followed Goggins’ lead by posting some loving tributes of her own on Instagram, in which she also used the song “Silver Springs” (and didn’t change it), and also didn’t tag Goggins.\n\nWhy did people read so much into two actors failing to tag each other? Why couldn’t it just be a case of them being sloppy or not very good at Instagram? One of them is in his 50s, after all. But no, this supposedly suspicious activity led some fans to discover that Goggins and Wood weren’t following each other on Instagram when the finale aired, and some even posited that he had blocked her, because, as Vogue explained, “her comments no longer showed up under his posts, but his comments were still visible on her posts.” As childish as it feels to discuss something as small as actors not following their co-stars on social media, I have to grudgingly admit that where there’s smoke, there’s often fire in these types of situations: If the Blake Lively–Justin Baldoni feud has taught us anything, it’s that famous people do sometimes spite-unfollow other famous people, so there are sometimes real insights to be mined from these sorts of things. Just as often, however, gossip about celebrities unfollowing each other is meaningless, because it’s reported that someone unfollowed someone when they never followed that person in the first place. I wish Hollywood publicists could get it through their clients’ heads that fans are reading into every single click they make on Instagram, so they should probably stop using it so pettily, but alas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat did all of this supposedly add up to, though? The implication was that there was some kind of rift between Goggins and Wood, and for reasons that are both unfair (they’re a man and a woman who played a couple on TV) and actually kind of fair (they were the ones who brought “Silver Springs” into it!), it didn’t take long for the speculation to turn to the idea that said rift stemmed from some kind of romance gone wrong. Or, as one person on Reddit memorably put it: “There is no planet on which they didn’t fuck.” (Just relaying one person’s perspective—sorry!) Their fellow White Lotus co-star Jason Isaacs certainly did the two no favors by going around, puckishly implying that there was all sorts of drama on set to every media outlet he spoke to. Who knew Lucius Malfoy was so messy?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the finale, headlines about the possible falling-out between Goggins and Wood have seemingly only gained steam. When Wood criticized a Saturday Night Live sketch that poked fun at her in April, several articles were quick to note that Goggins praised the same sketch. When Goggins was announced as an SNL host, that too was interpreted as a possible dig at Wood, though it was also rumored that Wood might join Goggins on his episode to publicly bury the hatchet. In early May, Goggins inspired another round of headlines by abruptly ending an interview with the Times of London rather than answer any questions about Wood. Though that sounds bad, some scholars of the matter had a more charitable (to Goggins) interpretation of the incident, namely that the actor understandably wanted to focus on the film he was supposed to be promoting, and the journalist speaking to him was being kind of a jerk. This is fair enough, but also, shouldn’t he and his team have devised a polite way to address this obvious question? I suppose it’s still no evidence of anything more salacious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that brings us to the present: Goggins and Wood both attended the Met Gala in New York Monday night. Reporters, naturally, spoke to Wood about whatever is going on between the two of them. As has been true throughout this saga, she had only kind things to say about Goggins. She did note that she would not be going on SNL, though, and if the two took a photo together, I haven’t seen it. As of Tuesday, the two are back to following each other. Where does this all leave us? Is it possible Goggins is not the easiest to get along with? And that shooting The White Lotus in particular was a difficult experience for him? I think where I come down on it all is that while there’s no actual smoking-gun proof of any kind of love affair gone wrong, there’s also so much pointing to something being off that it’s hard to ignore, and some kind of falling-out seems plausible. And that may be all we can say for sure unless Jason Isaacs can be persuaded to spill. Mike White mercifully gave Rick and Chelsea a clear ending on the show, but the people obsessed with what happened with Goggins and Wood off-screen are going to have to live with a little ambiguity."}

Tiny, repeated efforts will get you there.\r\nI have witnessed people reinventing themselves at all age… [+9787 chars]", "title": "7 Things You Should Insist On Doing for Yourself More Often", "fullContent": "You can’t lift a thousand pounds all at once, yet you can easily lift one pound a thousand times. Tiny, repeated efforts will get you there.\n\nI have witnessed people reinventing themselves at all ages — 48-year-olds starting families, 57-year-olds graduating from college for the first time, 71-year-olds starting successful businesses, and more. How did they all do it? In a nutshell, they started making gradual progress in their lives, step by step. And by doing so, they changed the trajectory of their their lives.\n\nWhat you need to remember most right now is that it isn’t too early or too late to start making positive changes in your life. Your future is always affected by what you start doing today. Yet so many people wait around for some arbitrary date and time, like tomorrow, to take action. Don’t be one of them! Make yourself a priority starting now! It’s time to…\n\n1. Insist on embracing your humanness.\n\n“Human” is the only real label we are born with, yet we forget so easily. To become attached to a loaded label of overweight, divorced, diseased, rejected, or poor, is to be like the rain, that doesn’t know it is also the clouds… or the ice, that forgets it is water. For we are far more than the shape we’re currently in. And we, like the wind, water, and sky, will change forms many times in our lives, while forever remaining beautifully human.\n\nSo forgive yourself for the bad decisions you made, for the times you lacked understanding, for the choices that accidentally hurt others and yourself. Forgive yourself, for being young and reckless. These are all vital lessons. And what matters most right now is your willingness to grow from them.\n\nOnce we forgive ourselves and fully embrace our humanness, it’s almost funny to see how seamlessly we can adapt to life’s transitions — how we outgrow what we once thought we couldn’t live without, and then we fall in love with what we didn’t even know we wanted. Take this to heart. And don’t forget to pause regularly to appreciate how far you’ve come. You’ve been through a lot, and you’ve grown a lot too. Give yourself credit for the steps you’ve taken, so you can step forward again with grace.\n\n2. Insist on subtracting what doesn’t belong in your life.\n\nWhen you discover something that nourishes your soul and brings you joy — something that truly matters to you — care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. And if you find that you don’t have enough time for what matters, stop doing things that don’t. In other words, start subtracting what isn’t working for you.\n\nEvery time you subtract negative from your life, you make room for more positive. Let that sink in. When things aren’t adding up in your life, begin subtracting. Life gets a lot simpler and more enjoyable when you clear the emotional and physical clutter that makes it unnecessarily complicated. And there’s so much you can let go of in life without losing a thing. It’s called growth. Letting go of the old makes way for the new. Letting go of what isn’t working makes way for what will. When the pain of holding on is worse than the pain of letting go, it’s time to let go and grow.\n\n3. Insist on leaving other people’s judgmental opinions alone.\n\nWhen Marc and I first started writing on this blog, I’d agonize over whether people would think what I was writing was good enough. I desperately hoped they’d like it, and oftentimes I’d catch myself imagining they didn’t. Then one day I realized how much energy I was wasting worrying about it. So I’ve gradually learned to relax with simply not knowing. Some problems in life, such as not knowing what others think of you, are not really meant to be resolved.\n\nWhat you need to remember is that you can’t control how other people feel, or how they receive your energy. Anything you do or say gets filtered through a mindset occupied by whatever they are going through at the moment, which likely has nothing to do with you. Just keep doing your thing with as much love and passion as possible.\n\n4. Insist on upholding your boundaries.\n\nWhen it happens, be sure to tune out the cheap shots people take at you. Don’t waste words on people who deserve your silence. Sometimes the most powerful thing you can say is nothing at all. So before you waste it on anger, spite, or frustration, think of how precious and irreplaceable your time is, and carry on with grace.\n\nAnd remember that not all toxic relationship situations are agonizing and uncaring on purpose. Some of them involve people who care about you — people who have good intentions, but are toxic because their needs and way of existing in the world force you to compromise yourself and your happiness. They aren’t inherently bad people, but they aren’t the right people to be spending time with every day.\n\nYou simply can’t ruin yourself on a daily basis for the sake of someone else. You have to create boundaries and make your well-being a priority. Whether that means breaking up with someone, loving a family member from a distance for a little while, letting go of a social obligation, or removing yourself from a daily situation that feels painful — you have every right to create some healthy space for yourself. (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the Relationships chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)\n\n5. Insist on putting your heart and soul into the things you do.\n\nThere’s a big difference between empty fatigue and gratifying exhaustion. Starting today aim for the latter. Too often we wait around because we think we need to “find” something new or different to be passionate about, but that’s not true. If you want more passion and satisfaction in your life, act accordingly right now. Put your whole heart and soul into the next thing you do. Not into tomorrow’s opportunities, but the opportunity right in front of you. Not into tomorrow’s tasks, but today’s tasks. Not into tomorrow’s run, but today’s run. Not into tomorrow’s conversations, but today’s conversations…\n\nIn the end, purpose is the reason you journey and passion is the fire that lights your way. So start believing in your heart that you’re meant to live each day full of purpose and passion — that each and every moment is worthy in its own way. I’m absolutely certain you have plenty in your life right now that’s worth your time, energy, and passionate focus. You have people and circumstances in your life that need you as much as you need them. You have a massive reservoir of passionate potential within you, just waiting. Stop waiting! Put your heart and soul into what you’ve got right in front of you! Become it, let it become you, and great things will happen for you, to you, and because of you.\n\n6. Insist on stretching yourself in the right ways.\n\nAgain, many great things can be done in a day if you don’t always make that day tomorrow. Will it always be easy? No, but remember that when you’re struggling to make progress that’s when you actually are. You want to be stretched to the edge of your ability — it needs to be slightly hard and uncomfortable sometimes. Of course most of us don’t want to be uncomfortable, so we subconsciously run from the possibility of discomfort. The obvious problem with this is that, by running from discomfort, we are constrained to partake in only the opportunities within our comfort zones. And since our comfort zones are relativity small, we miss out on most of life’s greatest and healthiest experiences, and we get stuck in a debilitating cycle.\n\nChoose differently starting today… Go to environments that expand your mind. Spend time with people who inspire you to stretch yourself. Read books. Grow. Get better. Your life is in your hands.\n\n7. Insist on reminding yourself of why every step matters.\n\nIn the end all the small things make a big difference. Every step is crucial. Life isn’t about a single moment of great triumph and attainment. It’s about the trials and errors that slowly get you there — the blood, sweat, tears, and the small, inconsequential things you do on a day-to-day basis. It all matters in the end — every step, every regret, every decision, every minor setback and minuscule win.\n\nThe seemingly useless happenings add up to something. The minimum-wage job you had in high school. The evenings you spent socializing with coworkers you never see anymore. The hours you spent writing thoughts on a personal blog that no one reads. Contemplations about elaborate future plans that never came to be. All those lonely nights spent reading novels and news columns and comic strips, questioning your own principles on life and sex and religion and whether or not you’re good enough just the way you are.\n\nAll of this has strengthened you. All of this has led you to every success you’ve ever had. All of this has made you who you are today. And all of this proves that you have the strength to deal with the challenges in front of you. So keep giving yourself grace, and carry on. (Note: “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day” is a great tool for this kind of self-reflection.)\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nYes, it’s your turn starting today. I hope you will have a delightful one, that you will dream boldly and dangerously, that you will leverage the reminders above to create something that didn’t exist before you took action, that you will love and be loved in return, and that you will find the strength to accept and grow from the outcomes you can’t change. And, most importantly (because I think there should be more kindness and wisdom in this crazy world), that you will, when you must, be wise with your decisions, and that you will always be extra kind to yourself and others.\n\nBut before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay.

Investors jumped in fast. Orders hit $10 billion – more than twice the amount Apple was looking for. That kind of demand shows investors are eager for strong names, especially now that bond spreads have narrowed by around 20 basis points since late April. That timing lines up with signs of a possible easing in U.S. tariffs, which may have helped credit conditions. Even with over $200 billion in cash, Apple sees smart borrowing as a way to fund buybacks and dividends at a cost of just 4.5% – well below its average capital cost. That lets the company keep its cash pile intact for investments in services, wearables, and R&D.\n\n‎\n\nMacDailyNews Take: A very nice reception for Apple’s latest bond offering!\n\n‎\n\nPlease help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

If you’re not using custom shortcuts, you could be missing out on a powerful tool to simplify your daily routines. The Shortcuts app, a built-in feature on your iPhone, allows you to create personalized actions that streamline your device’s functionality. From toggling airplane mode to adjusting brightness or even restarting your device, custom shortcuts can save you time and effort, making your iPhone more efficient and tailored to your unique needs. The video below from iDeviceHelp gives us more details.\n\nWhat Are Custom Shortcuts?\n\nCustom shortcuts are automated sequences of actions that you can create using the Shortcuts app. These shortcuts combine multiple steps into a single tap, allowing you to perform tasks faster and with less hassle. For instance, while iPhones don’t have a native restart button, you can create one using the app. Similarly, you can design shortcuts to toggle silent mode, enable airplane mode, or adjust settings like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\n\nCreating a shortcut is a straightforward process. Open the Shortcuts app, tap “Create Shortcut,” and select the action you want to automate. You can even combine multiple actions into one shortcut. For example, you could create a shortcut that enables airplane mode, dims your screen, and activates Do Not Disturb simultaneously. This level of customization ensures your iPhone operates exactly how you want it to, enhancing both convenience and efficiency.\n\nWhat Can You Do with Custom Shortcuts?\n\nThe Shortcuts app offers a wide range of actions, making your iPhone more versatile and efficient. By using these capabilities, you can simplify everyday tasks and reduce the time spent navigating through menus. Here are some of the most useful categories of actions:\n\nConnectivity Options: Quickly toggle airplane mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular data, or your personal hotspot with a single tap.\n\nQuickly toggle airplane mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular data, or your personal hotspot with a single tap.

App and Camera Functions: Open specific apps, navigate to desired locations, or access camera features like capturing photos, recording videos, or scanning QR codes.\n\nThese shortcuts eliminate the need to navigate through multiple menus, allowing you to focus on what matters most. Whether you’re managing device settings or accessing frequently used apps, custom shortcuts make your iPhone more intuitive and user-friendly.\n\nHow to Add Shortcuts to Your Home Screen\n\nOnce you’ve created a shortcut, adding it to your home screen ensures quick and easy access. The Shortcuts app allows you to customize each shortcut’s icon, color, and name, making them visually distinct and easy to identify. This personalization not only enhances usability but also helps you organize your home screen more effectively.\n\nFor better organization, consider grouping related shortcuts into folders. For example, you could create a folder named “Quick Settings” that includes shortcuts for airplane mode, flashlight, and screen brightness. This approach keeps your home screen tidy while making sure that essential functions are always within reach. By tailoring your home screen layout to your preferences, you can streamline your workflow and reduce the time spent searching for specific features.\n\nPractical Applications of Custom Shortcuts\n\nThe true value of custom shortcuts lies in their ability to simplify and enhance your daily interactions with your iPhone. Here are some practical examples of how they can improve your experience:\n\nRestart Your iPhone: Use a shortcut to restart your device with a single tap, bypassing the need to navigate through settings.\n\nUse a shortcut to restart your device with a single tap, bypassing the need to navigate through settings.

By reducing the number of steps required to complete common tasks, you can save time and focus on what’s important.\n\nAdvanced Features and Integration\n\nThe Shortcuts app isn’t limited to basic functions—it also supports advanced features that allow for deeper customization and integration. You can connect shortcuts with third-party apps, automate routines, or set up triggers based on time, location, or other conditions. For example, you could create a shortcut that automatically enables Wi-Fi and disables cellular data when you arrive home, or one that sends a pre-written text message when you leave work.\n\nAdditionally, the app supports integration with Siri, allowing you to activate shortcuts using voice commands. This hands-free functionality is particularly useful when you’re driving, cooking, or multitasking. By exploring these advanced features, you can transform your iPhone into a personalized assistant that adapts to your needs and preferences.\n\nWhy You Should Start Using Custom Shortcuts\n\nCustom shortcuts are a powerful yet underutilized feature that can significantly enhance your iPhone’s usability. By taking advantage of the Shortcuts app, you can create personalized actions, access essential functions with a single tap, and organize your home screen for maximum efficiency. Whether you’re looking to simplify connectivity options, streamline device controls, or explore advanced automation, custom shortcuts offer a practical and effective solution.\n\nStart exploring the Shortcuts app today to discover how it can transform the way you use your iPhone.

You should too", "fullContent": "Every file and every program leaves traces in your system: It accesses other files, uses Windows resources, makes entries in the registry, and possibly installs additional software.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, you will only clutter up your Windows if the software’s uninstall routine does not delete all associated files and registry entries. In the worst-case scenario, malware will infect your system or ransomware will encrypt your files.\n\nIf you want to try out new programs or open unknown files, it is best to do this in a particularly secure environment that is separate from the running system: This is exactly what a sandbox offers.\n\nIf you open a program in a sandbox, it works as expected, but cannot make any permanent changes to the system or access resources outside its environment — the sandbox prevents this, redirects access, and deletes all activities of the program and itself when you close it.\n\nWith a sandbox, you can therefore try out new software or install programs from dubious sources with less risk, surf potentially unsafe websites, and keep your system clean.\n\nWe will show you various ways of setting up and using a suitable sandbox for programs and files under Windows: These range from Windows on-board resources and virtual systems to browsers and programs with their own sandbox function.\n\nWe describe the Sandboxie-Plus software in particular detail — the simplest and most practical sandbox solution for most users.\n\nSandbox for the browser\n\nYou probably already use a sandbox: Current browsers such as Chrome and Firefox use this protection technology.\n\nThey rely on Windows security mechanisms: This has the advantage that they can guarantee a high level of protection without having to use a lot of resources, which could result in websites opening slowly, for example.\n\nLike most browsers, Chrome opens each tab in its own isolated process, which can be seen in the Task Manager. All websites are shielded from each other. IDG\n\nEach browser tab is opened in its own sandbox. This prevents Chrome and others from automatically downloading programs on a website or running malicious scripts.\n\nThis process also protects against attacks that are executed via a website without an antivirus program raising the alarm (zero-day exploits).\n\nEach tab of the browser runs as an isolated process and has no access to other tabs or the system. It also starts with very limited rights — which is why you usually have to authorize a website’s access to the computer camera, for example.\n\nIn addition, the separation of the individual tabs should mean that the crash of a website does not paralyze the entire browser, but only the corresponding tab.\n\nHow and whether the browser sandbox works can be observed in the Windows Task Manager: Under “Processes” you can see that numerous other processes are running under the “Google Chrome” entry — these are the separate sandboxes of the individual tabs.\n\nFurther reading: How to turn a USB flash drive into a secure login key for your PC\n\nYou can find out more details by entering the command\n\nchrome://sandbox/\n\nin the browser address bar: The tabs here are called “Renderer” — this is the function that displays web pages. Each should also appear in the “Sandbox” column and in the next column with the note “Lockdown.”\n\nLike the “Untrusted” entry to the right, this means that this process has very few access rights to the system.\n\nIDG\n\nNevertheless, you should always update your browser, as hackers often try to exploit the sandbox via other security vulnerabilities in order to give scripts and programs on a website more access rights.\n\nPrograms with a built-in sandbox\n\nWindows also uses a sandbox for certain programs: Apps from the Microsoft Store — the so-called UWP apps (Universal Windows Platform) — run in an isolated process with reduced rights.\n\nThis means they can be uninstalled without leaving any residue. In many cases, you must also authorize them to access files or hardware such as the camera or microphone.\n\nHowever, only a few users use UWP apps. The more frequently installed standard programs — the so-called desktop apps — run without a sandbox and rights restrictions.\n\nYou also give many UWP apps certain rights during installation. You can check what these are before installation on the app page in the Microsoft Store under the entry “This app can” and after installation in the Windows settings under “Privacy > App permissions.”\n\nYou can revoke these rights there — although this often means that the app no longer functions correctly.\n\nPrograms from the Microsoft Store run in an isolated environment: However, they often request numerous rights during installation, which undermine this protection. Foundry\n\nFrom version 24H2, Windows 11 also supports a sandbox function for normal programs — Win32 App Isolation. However, manufacturers must incorporate this into their software for the protection to work.\n\nAcrobat Reader offers a secure sandbox function for PDF documents: If you receive a PDF as an attachment from an email or an insecure source, you can prevent code contained in the document from being executed or you from being taken to a nefarious website when you click on a link in the PDF.\n\nTo use the PDF sandbox, go to “Settings > Security (advanced)” in the Reader menu and activate the “Enable protected mode on startup” option.\n\nAdditional protection is provided by the “Protected view” below, where you can choose whether it should apply to all PDFs or only to those from insecure sources. The Reader then opens the PDF in read-only mode, which means it cannot be filled in and usually cannot be saved or printed.\n\nFree special tool Sandboxie-Plus\n\nThe small open source tool Sandboxie-Plus is ideal for running all suspicious files and programs in isolation. You install it as usual under Windows and can then start the desired content directly in a sandbox container.\n\nThe complete range of functions of Sandboxie-Plus costs $40 per year: You can pay the programmer directly via Paypal or you can buy a supporter certificate on the website.\n\nFor use on a home computer, however, the free basic functions, which we present below, are sufficient.\n\nWith Sandboxie-Plus, programs can be started in an isolated environment: They cannot access the system and can be removed without leaving any residue. Foundry\n\nSandboxie-Plus is available in versions for standard Windows and for Arm Windows.\n\nThe tool can also be installed as a mobile app on a USB stick. After installation, you will be greeted by a setup wizard where you first select the option “Personal, for non-commercial use” for the free functions.\n\nIn the next window, you can obtain a so-called evaluation certificate by clicking on the red, underlined text: This allows you to test the software with all functions for 10 days.\n\nOtherwise, click on “Next.” For the user interface, you can choose between an expert and a beginner mode as well as a light or dark mode for the display.\n\nIt is best to accept the default settings and click “Next” again. Finish setting up the software in the last window by clicking on “Finish.”\n\nIn the following window for the “Global settings,” you do not need to adjust anything and click on “OK.”\n\nRunning risky programs in Sandboxie-Plus\n\nSandboxie-Plus starts with a two-part interface: At the top you will see the entry for a “DefaultBox.” You can start suspicious programs in this box. In the lower window, the tool logs all actions and settings.\n\nThe user interface can also be called up by right-clicking on the tool icon in the system tray and selecting “Show / Hide.”\n\nTo start software safely in a sandbox, click on “Sandbox > Run in sandbox.” Confirm the settings in the next window with “OK.”\n\nAnother window then appears: Enter the name of the software that you want to start in Sandboxie-Plus and confirm with “OK.” If you do not know the exact name or the tool cannot find a program that matches your input, you can call up the software directly with the Explorer via “Search.”\n\nThis start procedure is recommended for programs that you have installed but want to start again in the secure environment — for example, your web browser: If you call it up again in the sandbox, you can use it to visit suspicious websites without risk.\n\nThe program then starts: The corresponding EXE file appears in the top window of Sandboxie-Plus.\n\nYou can recognize that software is running in the sandbox by two features: Its name in the program window begins and ends with a diamond symbol — for example, if you open the Chrome browser in the sandbox and drag the mouse to its icon in the taskbar, it will say [#] New Tab – Google Chrome [#].\n\nIf you move the mouse to the top edge of the program window, a yellow frame appears. There is also a window finder in Sandboxie-Plus under “Sandbox — Is the window in a sandbox?”\n\nThere, click on the circle in the small program window on the left, hold down the left mouse button and release it in the window of the program whose status you want to check: The answer to the question will then appear in the window finder.\n\nSandboxie-Plus is also entered in the context menu of Windows Explorer: You can then call up the desired program with a right-click and the command “Start Sandboxed.”\n\nFor example, software that you have just downloaded can be installed in the sandbox by starting the corresponding EXE or installation file with Sandboxie-Plus.\n\nIt is advisable to run each program and each file in its own sandbox: When starting via Sandboxie-Plus or the context menu, select the entry “Run in a new sandbox” in the next window and then “Standard sandbox.”\n\nYou can also give each sandbox a meaningful name here.\n\nImportant programs can be started particularly quickly in Sandboxie-Plus, for example your browser, your email program, or Windows Explorer: Click on an existing sandbox in the top right-hand corner of the tool window.\n\nThen select “Start > Standard programs” and then the desired software.\n\nOpen and check suspicious files\n\nLike programs, individual files can also be opened in an isolated sandbox. Sandboxie-Plus starts the default program for this file — for example Word for a DOCX file.\n\nIf the program crashes, change a setting in Sandboxie-Plus: Open the file in a new sandbox as described. In the window in which you select “Standard Sandbox” as the box type, tick the “Configure advanced options” option at the bottom right.\n\nAfter clicking on “Next,” select “Version 1” for “Virtualization scheme,” click on “Next” several times, and finish with “Finish.”\n\nWith Sandboxie-Plus, you can tell whether a software really works in the sandbox by the yellow frame around the program window and the hashtags before and after the program name at the top. IDG\n\nImportant: A program that you start in the sandbox can only read files outside the sandbox and cannot change them. If you open a file within the sandboxed software, it can be changed, but this has no effect on the original file:\n\nFor example, if you start Outlook in the sandbox and delete an email there, it will still be there when you open Outlook normally.\n\nEmails with suspicious attachments can be examined in this way: You open your mail program in the sandbox and open the attachment. If it seems suspicious or comes from an unexpected sender, delete the sandbox and then delete the email in your normal email program without opening it or looking at the attachment.\n\nSandboxie-Plus isolates programs and files by creating separate directories for them: These are located in the program directory “C:\\Sandbox\\username,” where there is a separate folder for each sandbox.\n\nThe tool also stores changes made by the isolated program in the registry there. In this way, no traces remain in the system when you delete the corresponding sandbox.\n\nYou can do this by right-clicking on the desired sandbox in the upper window of Sandboxie-Plus and selecting “Remove sandbox” from the context menu. If you want to keep the sandbox but close the programs running in it, select the “Close all processes” command in the context menu.\n\nAlternative: Virtual PC\n\nA virtual PC (VPC) is also suitable for starting risky programs or opening suspicious files. Windows includes the Windows Sandbox for this purpose. It is a VPC based on Microsoft’s Hyper-V virtualization software, but is only included in Windows Pro.\n\nYou also need to install it first: You do this via the Control Panel and “Enable or disable Windows features.” Select the “Windows Sandbox” entry there and restart the computer.\n\nYou will then find the program as “Windows Sandbox” in the selection of installed apps. After starting, another Windows desktop opens as the user interface of the virtual PC: You operate this as you would your normal system — so you can install and try out programs in the Windows Sandbox.\n\nYou can copy and paste suspicious files from the main system to the virtual Windows.\n\nSince the Windows 11 update 22H2, the VPC also supports a restart that preserves its data and applications. However, this only applies if you only restart the sandbox: If you close the VPC window or restart the main system, the contents of the sandbox will be deleted.\n\nIf you are using Windows Home, you can use free virtualization programs such as Virtualbox for a VPC. However, the virtual computer needs an operating system — if it is to be Windows, you will need an additional lisence for this.\n\nA VPC is largely isolated from the main system and is a secure test environment.\n\nCompared to Sandboxie-Plus, however, it is oversized if you only occasionally want to try out unknown programs or open suspicious email attachments: You have to install your own operating system in the VPC, which places correspondingly high demands on your computer’s hardware.\n\nThis applies on the one hand to CPU performance, but above all to RAM: You should provide at least 4GB of RAM exclusively for the virtual system; more RAM significantly increases the ease of use of the VPC.\n\nIt is also not ideal for a quick file check: You have to start the VPC like a normal system and wait until the virtual Windows is ready for use."}

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other AI stocks in the news today.\n\nThe Trump administration may soon abandon the tiered approach to accessing advanced AI chips and replace it with a global licensing regime with government-to-government agreements. Developing such a structure would likely conform to President Donald Trump’s broader trade strategy of making deals with individual countries. The US would then have an easier time leveraging the American-designed chips in negotiations.\n\n“There are some voices pushing for elimination of the tiers. I think it’s still a work in progress.” — -Wilbur Ross, who served as Commerce secretary during the first Trump administration.\n\nChanges to the Biden-era rule will potentially limit global access to AI chips and the tiers that previously helped determine how many advanced semiconductors a country could obtain.\n\nREAD NEXT: 12 AI Stocks Making Waves Today and 10 AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week\n\nProvided that the plans to change these rules follow through, these US chips would have the power to steer trade talks. The rule, known as the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, was issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce in January. Companies must conform to its restrictions starting on May 15.\n\nOther possible changes being considered in the Trump administration include a lower threshold for an exception to licensing. Currently, orders under the equivalent of about 1,700 of Nvidia’s H100 chips do not count toward country caps. Rather, the government needs to be notified of the order with no licence necessary.\n\nThe administration is considering making the cutoff orders under the equivalent of 500 H100 chips. All of these possible changes by the Trump administration aim to make the rules stronger yet simpler. However, a few experts are of the belief that removing the tiers would make the rule even more complicated.\n\nMany companies and the industry as a whole don’t approve of the rule in the first place, stating that limiting access to chips would provoke countries to buy from China instead. Seven Republican senators even sent a letter to Lutnick, the United States Secretary of Commerce, in mid-April to have the rule withdrawn. The letter stated that the restrictions would incentivize buyers, especially in Tier 2 countries, to turn to China’s “unregulated cheap substitutes.”\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.
