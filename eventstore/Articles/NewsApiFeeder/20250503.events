Even if we never see them (remember Project Soli?), the ideas that come from Google's genius worker bees can be cool as heck.\n\nBut hearing them can also be a pain in the you-know-what. It's always been that way, and the reason has never changed — Google I/O is not for you and me.\n\n(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)\n\nMaybe I'm getting ahead of myself. If you're a software developer interested in Google's consumer products, or if you are interested in becoming one, then it is for you. If you're a regular Jane or Joe, like most of us, then it's a couple of days of talk about tokens and APIs with a tiny bit of interesting stuff sprinkled through.\n\nIt's my job to pay attention, and I still love to dabble with development, but even I get overwhelmed. Not that I'm some sort of tech Superman, but I am closer to the actual intended audience than most.\n\nDon't worry though, because after all these years I have figured out exactly how to digest what's cool and different coming from Google's annual developer conference: don't pay a lot of attention to it.\n\n(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)\n\nReally, I'm serious. If you're a bit of a nerd, then the keynote and What's New in Android presentations can be fun to watch, but be prepared to hear about stuff like those tokens, limits, AI engines, and analytical training for most of the hour.\n\nLet people like me, who are forced to watch and pay attention, do it. Then we tell you about it, without all the tech-nerd gobbly-goo. Anything cool will be all over your favorite tech websites; we'll be covering it extensively because it's what we at Android Central do best. We might even get a little nerdy from time to time (I forgive you if you don't read my I/O nerd articles).\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhen everything is said and done we will have a complete wrap-up of everything announced as well as the gems that get hidden in the individual sessions. So will other Android websites, or general tech sites like The Verge.\n\nRead all of those. If it sounds cool, read it twice, even. Then, be prepared to never see any of it materialize so that when some of it does happen, it's a pleasant surprise. Cynical, but healthy.\n\nLike I said earlier, Google I/O isn't for you. Really, even the stuff about what's coming in Android 16 isn't for you. On its surface, it is meant to get developers ready, but at its core, it's all done for the shareholders.\n\nLike it or not, all businesses work this way, and Google isn't an exception. Every single decision has to start with \"How does this affect share value?\" or eventually there will be no decisions to make because there will be no Google to make them.\n\nWhat Google has planned for its own Pixel phones is often cool as heck, and sometimes we even get to see some of it rub off on the software from other companies. If you really want to know about Android 16 for the Galaxy S25, for example, you should watch Samsung's developer conference.\n\nEither way, hearing about it can be fun.

This makes the dividend yield 5.3%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nTruist Financial's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained.\n\nHaving distributed dividends for at least 10 years, Truist Financial has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Despite this history however, the company's latest earnings report actually shows that it didn't have enough earnings to cover its dividends. This is an alarming sign that could mean that Truist Financial's dividend at its current rate may no longer be sustainable for longer.\n\nOver the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 174.4%. The future payout ratio could be 49% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.\n\nNYSE:TFC Historic Dividend May 3rd 2025\n\nView our latest analysis for Truist Financial\n\nTruist Financial Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.96 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.08. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.0% per annum over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.\n\nDividend Growth Potential Is Shaky\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Earnings per share has been sinking by 37% over the last five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.\n\nThe Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable\n\nOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable.

While it has not been confirmed whether this particular outage was caused by such an event, experts have warned that the extreme temperature fluctuations that cause this phenomenon are expected to become more common due to climate change, posing a significant threat to electricity networks worldwide.\n\nHowever, this week's science news also brought positive updates for global energy production after scientists in China unveiled a new approach to safer nuclear energy using an old, abandoned U.S. technology.\n\nDinosaur handbags\n\nThe companies want to make luxury goods out of T. rex skin-inspired material. The bag in this image is crocodile leather (Image credit: Photo collage by Marilyn Perkins; Images by cumhurkaplan and SimoneN via Getty Images)\n\nCould dinosaur leather be the next big thing in fashion? This week, three companies working across fashion and biotechnology announced plans to create luxury accessories out of Tyrannosaurus rex \"leather,\" made in a lab using fossilized T. rex collagen and synthetically produced cells. The companies argue that their product would offer a \"cruelty-free\" and \"eco-friendly\" alternative to traditional leather, but not everyone is convinced by this proposal.\n\nWhile it is rare to find soft tissues in the fossil record, dinosaur collagen—a key structural protein found in many connective tissues, including skin—has been found in a small number of fossilized bones. However, these proteins are fragmented, meaning our understanding of T. rex collagen is incomplete.\n\nLive Science spoke to experts to hear their thoughts on this Cretaceous twist in luxury goods.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

(Image credit: NASA)\n\nWhen you think of astronauts, you might envision them floating weightlessly in zero gravity, but it's easy to overlook the smaller impacts of microgravity. In fact, gravity plays an important role in our body's functioning.\n\nUnlike vomiting, which uses the muscles of the digestive tract to force food back up into our mouths, the mechanics of burping rely almost entirely on gravity. Gravity helps separate gases from the solids and liquids in our stomachs and then allows it to float to the top. But what happens to the digestive system when astronauts have to burp in space?\n\n18th-century mummification\n\nFront and back views of the mummified body of Franz Xaver Sidler von Rosenegg. (Image credit: Andreas Nerlich)\n\nWhen we think of mummies, most of us will picture the dried out, bandaged bodies of the ancient Egyptians. More modern methods of body preservation such as embalming share similarities with these ancient practices. Embalmers have developed a number of unusual techniques for body preservation over the years, but few compare to those used on an 18th-century Austrian vicar.\n\nThe monk, named Franz Xaver Sidler von Rosenegg, died in 1746 and his remains were preserved in a church in the small village of Blasenstein. His body has been credited with various healing miracles over the years and the remains are known locally as the \"air-dried chaplain.\" For decades, his cause of death has remained a mystery, but a recent analysis determined that the vicar died from tuberculosis.\n\nThis analysis solved one mystery, but it also raised many questions after the team discovered that the corpse's anus had been stuffed full of wood chips and fabric , a previously undocumented embalming method missing from historical records.\n\nDiscover more archaeology news\n\n—2,300-year-old sword with swastikas unearthed at necropolis in France\n\n—'Propaganda' praising Ramesses II discovered on famous ancient Egyptian obelisk in Paris, Egyptologist claims\n\n—18 stab wounds to 3,700-year-old skull reveal fierce feuding in ancient China\n\nAlso in science news this week\n\n—'Annoying' version of ChatGPT pulled after chatbot wouldn't stop flattering users\n\n—Vesta, the 2nd-largest asteroid in the solar system, may be a piece of a lost planet\n\n—'Groundbreaking' ancient DNA research confirms Pueblo peoples' ties to famous Chaco Canyon site\n\n—Mystery of Bolivian 'zombie' volcano finally solved\n\nScience Spotlight\n\nWhere the craft will reenter remains unclear, but it will likely land in the ocean. (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn 1972, the U.S.S.R launched a space probe called Kosmos 482 as part of a program to learn more about Venus' hellish surface. However, a malfunction in the upper stage of its rocket booster left the craft without the required velocity to reach our cosmic neighbor. Instead, Komos got stuck in an elliptical orbit around our home planet.\n\nNow, new analysis shows that the descent module of the failed spacecraft is due for a fiery return back to Earth — and it should arrive some time in the next two weeks. Considering that the lander was designed to survive a descent through Venus' hostile atmosphere, it's possible that it will fall back to Earth intact.\n\nThe 1,091 pound (495 kilograms) lander is estimated to fall at a speed of 150 mph (242 km/h), and no one knows for sure where it will land. One possibility is that it could descend on a populated area, where it could do harm.\n\n\"The risks involved are not particularly high, but not zero,\" Marco Langbroek , a lecturer in space situational awareness at Delft Technical University in the Netherlands who discovered the lander's impending return, wrote in a blog post .\n\nSomething for the weekend\n\nIf you're looking for something a little longer to read over the weekend, here are some of the best long reads, book excerpts and interviews published this week.\n\n—'Vaccine rejection is as old as vaccines themselves': Science historian Thomas Levenson on the history of germ theory and its deniers\n\n—Catquistadors: Oldest known domestic cats in the US died off Florida coast in a 1559 Spanish shipwreck\n\n—'How could it have been allowed to happen?': The threat of 'superbugs' was known from the first antibiotic, but we've failed to stop it.\n\nScience in pictures\n\nThe Circinus West molecular cloud is a vast star-forming region 2,500 light-years from Earth.

At the center of the constellation is an ominous black cloud called Circinus West. It is known as a \"dark nebula\" because it is so dense that no light can penetrate it.\n\nThe cloud itself is made of star-forming gas, meaning its darkness cannot last forever. The gas routinely collapses into newborn stars, creating an active stellar nursery which can be seen as pinpricks of light bursting through the shadow that surrounds them.\n\nFollow Live Science on social media"}

Now we know why", "fullContent": "Windows 7 came onto the market in 2009 and put Microsoft back on the road to success after Windows Vista’s annoying failures. But Windows 7 was not without its faults, as this curious story proves.\n\nSome users apparently encountered a vexing problem at the time: if they set a single-color image as the background, their Windows 7 PC always took 30 seconds to start the operating system and switch from the welcome screen to the desktop.\n\nget windows 11 pro for cheap Windows 11 Pro\n\nIn a recent blog post, Microsoft veteran Raymond Chen explains the exact reason for this. According to him, a simple programming error meant that users had to wait longer for the system to boot. After logging in, Windows 7 first set up the desktop piece by piece, i.e. the taskbar, the desktop window, icons for applications, and even the background image.\n\nThe system waited patiently for all components to finish loading and received feedback from each individual component. Or, it switched from the welcome screen to the desktop after 30 seconds if it didn’t receive any feedback.\n\nThe problem here: The code for the message that the background image is ready was located within the background image bitmap code, which means that the message never appeared if you did not have a real background image bitmap. And a single color is not such a bitmap.\n\nThe result: the logon system waited in vain for the message that the background has finished loading, so Windows 7 never started until the 30 second fallback activated and sent users to the desktop.\n\nThe problem could also occur if users had activated the “Hide desktop icons” group policy. This was due to the fact that such policies were only added after the main code had been written and called by an If statement. However, Windows 7 was also unable to recognise this at first and therefore took longer to load.\n\nChen shows the following code snippet as an example to illustrate the problem:\n\n// Original code InitialiseDesktopIcons() { bind to the desktop folder enumerate the icons add them to the screen Report(DesktopIconsReady); } // Updated with group policy support InitialiseDesktopIcons() { if (desktop icons allowed by policy) { bind to the desktop folder enumerate the icons add them to the screen Report(DesktopIconsReady); } }\n\nUnsolved for months\n\nAccording to Chen, it took several months for Microsoft to recognize the problem. In November 2009, it was then fixed by an update and has not been a problem since, but is a nice anecdote for the various errors that can occur during programming."}

A New Tech Raises Big Questions\n\nSam Altman's World project is scanning irises across the U.S. to verify who's human—raising massive questions for educators, parents, and students. In this episode, I break down how it works, why it matters, and how you can spark meaningful classroom discussions with a free poster and downloadable Google Doc.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, Sam Altman’s identity project, now called World (formerly Worldcoin), launched iris and face-scanning locations in six U.S. cities.\n\nThe goal? Prove you're human — and get a World ID in return (and some of their cryptocurrency.)\n\nA Media Literacy Moment, For Sure\n\nThis story is important. As I did research, I was astounded at the variety of angles on this. Also, at what isn't being said and how deeply I had to dig. (Make a copy of my Google Doc with links and resources including the question poster.)\n\nSo, I wanted to break down the detailed research I conducted. My hope is that these various aspects and articles will help facilitate research and discussion with students. In my opinion, you can teach media literacy by showing the dramatically different angles that these articles share the story of these identity centers. From the “everybody get a free ID and some crypto” articles to the “oh no, this is bad for privacy” angle and even more!\n\nBias in Sources\n\nNot every story is simple. Not any one news source can be as trusted as the deep, intentional research and reading.\n\nAnd quite honestly, not every AI tool can be trusted. And, particularly because this is about OpenID, I found that my research required leaning on non-OpenAI tools. (Sam Altman leads OpenAI which created ChatGPT and is a co-founder of World.) I had to lean on AI tools other than ChatGPT to get at what I wanted for this one.\n\nWhatever AI I've used, it is incredibly hard to keep AI from minimizing my skeptical thoughts or concerns about AI. This is why I always write everything myself. I can use AI to format, but even then, I have to give intentional oversight on any work I do in the AI realm when using AI.\n\nA little bit of commentary from Vicki.(AI companies want you to use their tool. AI companies also want you to think favorably about their tools and companies. I am not saying they are intentionally doing anything, but remember, their employees are using their own tools and therefore, the training data, if they are using their own, most likely will bias the results. It is inherent in how AI works. I guess this is why people who say they no longer need people to train them that ChatGPT can tell them everything they need to know means they are not really educated on how AI works. It is this sort of thinking that marginalizes teachers of all ages. Get educated. Isn't that the noble profession we cherish?)\n\nAdditionally, as I recorded this, I wanted you to know that there are valid reasons why solutions are needed in a world where AI can imitate humans. However, this identity solution from World, in particular, is full of issues.\n\nWhy do we need to prove we are human?\n\nSo what are the three major reasons this global ID push is happening?\n\nStopping identity fraud and deepfakes.\n\nVerifying age online to protect children. This isn't in this solution now, but I can see it coming.\n\nDistinguishing humans from synthetic AI agents (in this case for dating sites.)\n\nYou might also be concerned why a dating site like Match.com is partnering with World. And also, why VISA would partner with this program? Good questions. I have my theories. (Even why Austin TX is one of the locations they chose.)\n\nCan a World Identity truly be anonymous?\n\nWhile World says that everything is anonymous, I want to remind us of its purpose.\n\nIt is obvious through the partnerships that the ultimate purpose is to cut fraud and slash fake profiles on dating sites which actually require a connection between you and your WorldID – and that, my friends, by definition is not anonymity. Be careful. Be wise. Your identity is priceless.\n\nI think that the next step is age verification and making sure someone is who they say they are – and likely worse. As I share in the show, social security numbers in the US were never intended to be a national number. But now, if someone steals yours, they can ruin your life.\n\nSo, I don't want to steal my own thunder by getting into everything here. I have included all of the notes below. I hope you'll take a few minutes to listen to the show, share your thoughts in the comments on this post or YouTube.\n\nIn particular, I'm interested in how you educators and parents will discuss or use this as a current events lesson with your students and children.\n\nListen to the Episode\n\nHow Do We Know Who's Human? – YouTube\n\nHow Do We Know Who’s Human?

You get a slightly smaller display (6.67” vs. 6.77”) and though it is a 1080p+ 120Hz OLED, it has a lower peak brightness (2,000 nits vs. 3,000 nits) and doesn’t have HDR10+ support like the Pro. It has basically the same Dimensity 7300 chipset, though, with expandable storage and the same 5,000mAh battery with 33W charging.\n\nThe real reason to get the Pro is for the cameras – the Phone 1 has a 50MP main on the back and that’s it. The Pro has a 50MP main with a fairly large 1/1.57” sensor (but no OIS), a 50MP 50mm telephoto and an 8MP ultra-wide. A new attachable back adds MagSafe magnets (there’s no wireless charging, but it’s nice for a car dock and to attach accessories) and serves as a mounting point for two lenses, macro and fisheye. Oh, and the Pro has NFC!\n\nWe’ve seen some commenters wish for features like OIS, for example. For that, you have to get the Nothing Phone (3a), but that costs 50% more. Compared to the CMF Phone 2 Pro, you get the same screen and cameras (now with OIS on the main) and a better Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset. Charging is boosted to 50W, but it’s still wired only. You do get the Glyph lights on the back, though.\n\nOkay, 50% more is maybe a bit much and you still don’t get things like eSIM (only the 3a Pro has that). What about the previous generation – the Nothing Phone (2a) is still around and is actually cheaper than the CMF Phone 2 Pro. You get a comparable 6.7” OLED display, HDR and all, plus Glyph lights and 45W charging for the 5,000mAh battery. There’s no telephoto camera, but how useful is a 50mm lens anyway? Plus, the 50MP main on this one has OIS and there is a high-resolution 50MP ultra-wide. The Dimensity 7200 Pro is only a bit slower, but you do lose the microSD slot.\n\nThe Poco X7 is powered by basically the same Dimensity 7300 chipset as the CMF Phone 2 Pro and you can get more RAM and a lot more storage (12/512GB) for just £10 more than the CMF. There’s no microSD slot, but with 512GB built-in that’s not as necessary. The Poco has proper water resistance (IP69 vs. IP54) and a better 6.67” 12-bit 1220p+ display with Dolby Vision. The 50MP main camera does have OIS, but it uses a smaller 1/1.95” sensor and is only joined by an 8MP ultra-wide – there’s no tele lens here. The battery is a bit larger and faster at 5,110mAh capacity and 45W charging.\n\nIf you have more money to spend, the Poco X7 Pro upgrades to a Dimensity 8400 Ultra (with all big Cortex-A725 cores) and a 6,000mAh battery with 90W charging. The cameras are the same as on the X7, though, i.e. not as good as the CMF.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, we shared some Pixel 9-series deals. The Pixel 9a offer is the same as it was then, a free pair of Pixel Buds A-Series.\n\nThe rest of the Pixel 9 models (the non-foldable ones) have the same deals as before with a couple of tweaks – first, you get a £100 coupon that you can use to buy a Pixel Watch 3, and second, the vanilla Pixel 9 is £50 more than it was a couple of weeks ago. Check out our Pixel 9 vs. 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro vs. 9 Pro XL articles for detailed comparisons.\n\nAs for the Google Pixel Watch 3 itself, it’s £70 off at the moment and that can go up to £170 if you buy it alongside a Pixel 9, 9 Pro or 9 Pro XL.\n\nIf you prefer Samsung watches, the Galaxy Watch Ultra, Watch7 and Watch6 Classic (with a rotating bezel) are up to £150 off if you have an active Prime subscription. Prime Students get an extra discounts on the latter two watches as well.\n\nWe may get a commission from qualifying sales."}

Use these faster alternatives instead", "fullContent": "When was the last time you used a USB flash drive? I had to think for a moment myself — and to be honest, I can’t remember exactly. For years, the USB stick was the device of choice when it came to fast and uncomplicated data transfer. Why do these practical storage aids hardly play a role today, and are they possibly even on the verge of extinction? A look at current developments sheds some light on this.\n\nWhy are USB flash drives no longer popular?\n\nAs compact and handy as they are, USB sticks have lost much of their relevance in recent years. One of the main reasons is their comparatively low storage capacity. Many commercially available models end at 256GB or 512GB, which means that large amounts of data such as 4K videos, complete photo archives, or system backups can only be transported to a limited extent.\n\nAlthough there are also some high-end sticks with up to 2TB of memory, such as the Seagate Ultra Compact SSD, many people prefer to use an SSD for such capacities. The reason: SSDs generally use more powerful flash chips, which ensure higher data transfer rates and a longer service life.\n\nAnother problem: The classic USB-A connection is hardly suitable for modern devices. Most laptops and tablets rely on USB-C, as do smartphones.\n\nmentioned in this article Seagate Ultra Compact SSD Read our review Best Prices Today:\n\nAlthough there are now USB sticks with Type C connectors, such as the aforementioned Seagate Ultra Compact. There are also so-called dual sticks with USB-A and USB-C connections, but in practice this is often a compromise. Many of these models rely on simple controllers and cheaper flash memory, which results in significantly slower transfer rates — especially when writing large files.\n\nModern alternatives to USB flash drives\n\nExternal hard drives: Lots of storage for little money\n\nExternal hard drives, such as External drives, such as SSDs, are robust and powerful — with significantly more storage space than the average USB stick.\n\n\n\nExternal drives — whether classic HDDs or fast SSDs — are among the most popular alternatives to USB sticks. They offer significantly more storage (up to 4TB and more), and SSDs in particular impress with their high transfer speed via USB-C or Thunderbolt. While HDDs offer a lot of space at a favorable price, SSDs are the better choice for large amounts of data, as they are faster, more robust, and hardly more expensive in higher storage classes than comparable USB sticks.\n\nAdvantages: Significantly more storage space than USB sticks\n\nShock-resistant and durable, higher-quality flash chips\n\nIdeal for backups or large amounts of data Disadvantages: Larger and heavier than a USB stick\n\nSometimes more expensive, especially for SSD models Sandisk Extreme Portable SSD 1TB (portable NVMe SSD) External drive with SSD technology 2.5 inch, USB-C, up to 2,000 MB/s read and write, NVMe SSD, IP65, 5-year warranty buy it on amazon for $129.99 Mattias Inghe\n\n\n\nCrucial X10 Pro 1TB Portable SSD External drive with SSD technology, USB-C, up to 2,100MB/s read and 2,000MB/s write, IP55 buy it on amazon for $114.80\n\nJon L.

They are standard, especially for cameras, drones, and mobile devices, as well as some laptops. In combination with a USB-C card reader, SD cards can even be used as mini storage drives for notebooks. Further reading: SD cards, demystified: How to decipher the confusing jumble of specs The advantage over classic USB sticks: SD cards can be used more flexibly in many areas, are often cheaper per gigabyte and — depending on the class and model — also achieve high transfer speeds. They are also easy to replace or permanently integrate into devices, such as cameras or laptops with card readers. So if you work with memory cards anyway, you can easily use them as a mobile drive (and save yourself the extra stick).

Services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, or OneDrive offer storage space on the internet that you can access from any device — without a physical drive. Advantages: Access from anywhere with an internet connection\n\nIdeal for collaboration and shared files\n\nAutomatic synchronization possible Disadvantages: Dependent on a stable internet connection\n\nLimited free storage, followed by a paid subscription\n\nData protection and encryption are important issues\n\nConclusion: USB drive only for special cases?\n\nThe humble USB flash drive has not yet completely lost its place — it is quite common and ideal for simple data transfers, firmware updates, or as a boot stick. But as an everyday solution, it is long outdated. The combination of limited memory, decreasing compatibility, and growing requirements makes it a discontinued model. Modern alternatives such as SSDs, SD cards, or cloud services offer better performance, more flexibility and, in many cases, a better price-performance ratio."}

Since joining Liverpool in 2020, the ‘Greek Scouser’ has never nailed down a starting place, but that has not stopped him from becoming a beloved figure among supporters.\n\nNow, according to Sky Sports‘ Lyall Thomas, the 28-year-old full-back “is expected to be moved on” this summer, as Liverpool prepare to refresh and evolve their defensive options ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.\n\nTsimikas’ future has come under scrutiny amid strong links to emerging talents such as Milos Kerkez, with the Anfield hierarchy reportedly targeting “a new left-back who can initially ‘share the workload’ with Robertson before eventually succeeding” him.\n\nOther names under consideration include Antonee Robinson and Rayan Ait-Nouri, both regarded as “the type of attacking left-backs Liverpool are looking for”. The shift in strategy suggests the club is now actively planning for life beyond Robertson’s prime, and unfortunately for Tsimikas, that means his time on Merseyside may be up.\n\nPlaying Time Always at a Premium\n\nTsimikas has never hit double digits in Premier League starts across any of his five seasons in red — a statistic that paints a clear picture. Even with Andy Robertson enduring a mixed run of form, neither Jürgen Klopp nor his successor Arne Slot has seen Tsimikas as a long-term solution at left-back.\n\nAs Sky Sports notes, he “would need three [starts] from the next four games if he’s to break that unenviable sequence,” according to data from WhoScored. At 28, and turning 29 in a fortnight, it’s only natural for the Greek international to seek regular first-team football.\n\nWhat’s more telling is the absence of noise from Tsimikas himself. Despite the lack of consistent opportunities, he’s remained respectful and grounded — no interviews agitating for a move, no social media antics. That sort of attitude will ensure any potential departure is met with nothing but goodwill.\n\nFA Cup Glory Cemented His Place in Hearts\n\nTsimikas’ legacy at Anfield may not be defined by appearances, but rather by the appearance. His nerveless penalty against Chelsea in the 2022 FA Cup final brought silverware to the red half of Merseyside and solidified his cult status.\n\nThat one moment alone etched his name into Anfield folklore. As Sky put it, he seems assured of “‘cult hero’ status among Kopites for years to come”. It’s rare for a backup player to receive such warm affection, but then again, Tsimikas’ journey has always been unique.\n\nShould he depart this summer, his name will be sung in the stands — not with regret, but with fondness and appreciation for a player who gave his all, even when he wasn’t the headline act.\n\nFuture Plans Point to Evolution Over Sentiment\n\nWith Arne Slot now firmly at the helm and fresh off delivering the Premier League title in his debut campaign, Liverpool’s plans to rejuvenate the squad reflect a club focused on sustained success.\n\nBringing in someone like Kerkez would not only add depth but also lay the foundation for the post-Robertson era. The fact that Tsimikas is “expected to be moved on” is no slight against him, but rather an unavoidable consequence of progress at the highest level.\n\nAs the summer window nears, Liverpool’s ambitions are clear: maintain the competitive edge, blend youth with experience, and ensure there’s no room for sentimentality when silverware is the goal.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThere’s something undeniably bittersweet about this. Tsimikas has never been the main man, but he’s our man. The sight of him racing down the wing, arms outstretched after that FA Cup winner — it’s etched in our memories. You can’t fake that kind of joy.\n\nWe’ve seen him make the most of every start, every minute. While others moaned or drifted, Tsimikas embraced the bench and still gave 100% when called upon. In the modern game, where ego often outweighs effort, that attitude is gold dust.\n\nIt’s understandable that Slot wants to build for the future, especially after the triumph of his first season. But some players, like Tsimikas, deserve a proper send-off. Not just a mention in the gossip columns, but a flag in the Kop and a song in his name.\n\nIf this is the end of the road for the Greek Scouser, we’ll remember him not for what he didn’t achieve, but for how he made us feel — like every player in red mattered.\n\nGood luck, Kostas. You’ll always have a place at Anfield."}

The Dutchman has led the Reds to domestic glory in his very first season, succeeding the charismatic Jürgen Klopp with an assuredness that has surprised even seasoned observers. But amid the champagne and silverware, Slot’s recent press conference at the AXA Training Centre offered insight into a subtler, more delicate challenge: managing the development of young talents like Harvey Elliott.\n\nSlot’s Strategic Rotation and Elliott’s Limited Role\n\nIt’s no secret that Harvey Elliott, once tipped as one of Liverpool’s brightest prospects, has not featured prominently during this title-winning campaign. Yet, Slot’s explanation for Elliott’s limited involvement this season was disarmingly transparent — and carefully measured.\n\n“Harvey is one of the players that hasn’t had as much playing time as he maybe deserves,” Slot admitted, before offering a candid account of the reasons. Elliott’s long injury layoff earlier in the season clearly disrupted his momentum, and Slot was unflinching in his assessment of the midfielder’s form upon return. “The first part after he came back from his injury, he wasn’t the same as he was before,” Slot noted.\n\nHowever, this was no dismissal of Elliott’s future at Liverpool. On the contrary, Slot emphasised that the 21-year-old has since shown tangible signs of recovery and progress. “The last few months he’s back to his old level again,” Slot said, pointing out the gradual increase in Elliott’s minutes as evidence of renewed trust. “That tells you that we like – I like – him more now than I did when he came back from his injury in the first month.”\n\nLiverpool’s Depth and the Challenge for Elliott\n\nIn truth, Elliott’s position at Liverpool has never been more complicated. He is part of a squad brimming with quality, particularly in midfield, where competition is fierce. Slot referenced this dynamic, explaining that the choices he’s made haven’t been driven by a lack of faith in Elliott but by the depth and form of those ahead of him.\n\nThere is also the matter of tactical fit. Slot’s high-energy, disciplined approach demands more than technical flair — it requires positional awareness, physical readiness, and adaptability. It’s possible that Elliott is still refining these attributes, particularly after such a significant injury.\n\nPath Forward Under Slot’s Vision\n\nWhat Slot’s comments reinforce is the idea that Liverpool are playing a long game with Elliott. At 21, he remains a valuable asset — not a fringe figure, but someone whose minutes must be managed carefully rather than squandered. The manager’s decision to be forthright with the player himself is telling. “I’ve been honest with him,” Slot said. It’s a simple sentence, but one loaded with significance in a football world often clouded by euphemisms.\n\nSlot’s transparent handling of Elliott — combined with his proven track record of improving players — suggests that the midfielder’s best days in red may yet be ahead. This is a manager who clearly values trust and communication, both of which are essential for a young player finding his footing after injury.\n\nMomentum Into Next Season\n\nWinning the league early presents Slot with a rare opportunity. With fixtures remaining against Chelsea, Arsenal, Brighton and Crystal Palace, he now has the luxury of gradually easing players like Elliott into more prominent roles without the looming pressure of results.\n\nSlot himself acknowledged this moment as a springboard. “We also have to look at this as the start of next season already,” he said. And for Elliott, that start may come sooner than expected — not out of charity, but because the manager sees the quality and the willingness to rise again."}

Kone, a powerful midfield presence, was profiled through the lens of data and tactical suitability.\n\nDr Barter was candid from the outset: “He is the most raw of the three,” referring to Kone in comparison to other prospects. Yet, he highlighted something that immediately caught the eye: “He’s a physical beast. Like, when you see him, it’s literally straight off the bat you go, ‘Wow, this lad’s massive.’”\n\nIt’s clear that Kone’s size and athletic profile are not in question. Barter pointed to the appeal: “That profile we know works, it’s just how quickly can you get him to the Premier League intensity?”\n\nTactical Fit and Development Curve\n\nA central theme in the discussion was Kone’s development stage and whether Liverpool under Arne Slot—fresh off a title-winning debut season—could afford to carry a player who would require adaptation time. “He’s played in a midfield two,” explained Barter, “so he’s not the most structured in terms of positional discipline.”\n\nThis immediately raised questions about fit. “That’s where the red flag goes up slightly for me,” Barter admitted, “because you are going to need to teach him.” Still, he was clear not to write Kone off: “I don’t think it’s a ‘no’, I just think it’s a ‘development needed’.”\n\nDavis added that it would be about where Kone is deployed. “If you see him as a rotational six that builds… maybe,” he speculated. But both agreed the player isn’t a plug-and-play solution.\n\nStrengths in Ball-Carrying and Recovery\n\nDespite concerns, Kone brings standout traits that suit Liverpool’s high-octane style. “He’s got strong recovery pace,” said Barter, and when discussing his ball progression, he added: “He carries the ball confidently and draws fouls… it’s very press-resistant.”\n\nIn a team that values transitional strength and breaking lines through direct midfield movement, these are positive signs. “You can tell he’s got that raw power and a bit of chaos to his game,” said Davis, noting it might be something the team lacks.\n\nBarter summarised it well: “He’s the type of player who’ll either get booked or start a counter… and sometimes both.”\n\nA Long-Term Prospect, Not a Quick Fix\n\nWhile Liverpool’s need for midfield depth remains real, the verdict on Kone was measured. “I think if you’re buying him, you need a clear plan,” said Barter. “You’re not putting him in as your second-choice six immediately.”\n\nDavis noted that Kone’s signing would be more in the mould of a future bet, echoing Liverpool’s history of developing players over time rather than demanding instant impact. “He’s the type where a year on loan might even do him good,” he suggested, hinting that Kone’s potential may be best nurtured slowly."}

For Arne Slot, the scenes of celebration at Anfield were more than a cathartic release after clinching a 20th English league crown. They were a statement. A calling card for the future. And above all, a magnet.\n\n“It’s also a perfect package to stay motivated ourselves,” Slot said. “Because to experience this once is really nice, but we would love to experience it one more time.”\n\nThe hunger is clear. From the players, who soaked in the ecstasy of Anfield’s seismic roars, to the supporters whose belief never wavered. But for Slot and his backroom staff, the challenge has already shifted forward. The question is no longer what have we done? but rather how do we do it again?\n\nTransfer targets and competitive pull\n\nLiverpool are in the rare position of being both reigning champions and an attractive destination. As Slot put it, “It definitely helps, I think, to attract new players as well, because mostly the players that we want to have, we are not the only clubs who think they are good players.”\n\nThis is where Liverpool’s emotional and tactical edge becomes vital. Slot is aware that in a transfer market dictated by slim margins and high stakes, showing not just success but a compelling culture can tilt decisions.\n\n“And then it helps maybe for them to see that the way we do things over here is special, I think you can say that.”\n\nIt’s not just about money or status. It’s about identity. Slot knows Liverpool must offer more than contracts—they must sell belief. And with sporting director Richard Hughes, conversations are already well underway.\n\n“In the background, of course I did this already a little bit,” Slot revealed. “Because it’s not like after we won the league, that’s the first time Richard [Hughes] called me and said, ‘OK, these are the players we are interested in!’”\n\nSquad continuity with calculated tweaks\n\nWith the title sealed, Slot isn’t planning to upend what’s working. However, subtle shifts are likely. Liverpool face Chelsea next, and while experimentation will be limited, Slot hinted at some light rotation.\n\n“We could maybe see a player in a certain position, what he does in that position combined with someone else,” he explained. “But like I said it is not going to be a big change, there’s not going to be seven or eight new starters.”\n\nInstead, it will be about cohesion. Keeping the spine intact. Mo Salah, still chasing his best Premier League goal haul, will have personal motivation. And for others, especially younger players, games like Chelsea away will serve as important tests.\n\n“It’s going to most of it be the same and to see how a few players do in a difficult game like Chelsea away and where they are in their development.”\n\nPlanning for more than glory\n\nThere is a calm authority in the way Slot speaks. Planning is not an off-season activity—it’s continuous. Victory brings time, and that time is being used wisely.\n\n“But I think there’s a bit more time for that now than there would have been if we still needed three points or a win or whatever,” Slot admitted. “So there’s a bit more time now to have these conversations.”\n\nLiverpool, under Slot, have embraced a quiet evolution. There is clarity, cohesion, and calm in the club’s new chapter. The celebrations may be winding down, but behind the scenes, a new campaign is already taking shape—rooted in identity, built with ambition, and driven by a belief that one title isn’t enough."}

With the Colombian international’s current deal set to run until 2027, the Reds are reportedly eager to avoid any lingering uncertainty as interest mounts from Europe and beyond.\n\nDespite being a key contributor to Liverpool’s Premier League title-winning campaign under new manager Arne Slot, Díaz’s future remains unresolved — and in recent weeks, speculation has intensified.\n\n“Liverpool plans to sort out the 28-year-old’s future in the coming days,” Sky Sports confirmed, echoing earlier reports from Colombian journalist Pipe Sierra.\n\nBREAKING: Luis Diaz will hold talks about extending his Liverpool contract at the end of the season 💬pic.twitter.com/BZmQf16kBq — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 2, 2025\n\nImpressive Campaign Strengthens Díaz’s Case\n\nDíaz ended the 2024/25 season with 16 goals and 5 assists in all competitions, a tally that clearly highlights his value in Slot’s high-intensity, attacking system. His performances on the left flank brought balance and flair, particularly during Liverpool’s decisive late-season push toward the title.\n\nSome inconsistency, combined with Liverpool’s historically conservative wage policy, may complicate negotiations. Díaz is currently on a reported £55,000 per week — a figure that feels modest given his output and influence.\n\n“There may be some compromise needed from both parties over the summer,” the article correctly observes. The Colombian is expected to seek a significant increase to reflect his role and market value, which has only been amplified by external interest.\n\nExternal Pressure from Europe and Saudi Arabia\n\nLuis Díaz is no stranger to transfer rumours, but the latest round is particularly credible. Fabrizio Romano, a trusted voice in the transfer market, has hinted at interest from Saudi clubs and notably, Barcelona.\n\nSporting Director Deco is reportedly keen on Díaz as a budget-conscious alternative to Athletic Club’s Nico Williams, with any potential move expected to cost upwards of £50 million. Díaz’s father added fuel to the fire back in 2023, saying: “Playing for Barça is his dream.”\n\nThough there is currently no official bid, the narrative builds pressure on Liverpool to act swiftly. Allowing Díaz’s deal to run down — even with two years left — would only lower his market value and introduce unnecessary noise to what should be a summer of squad strengthening.\n\nStrategic Timing Key for Liverpool\n\nBy sorting contract talks early in the summer, Liverpool can avoid a prolonged saga that could distract both club and player. With Jarell Quansah, Virgil van Dijk, and Mohamed Salah all securing new deals this season, Díaz represents the next logical step in Liverpool’s retention strategy.\n\nDíaz may not yet have the same legendary status as Salah or Van Dijk, but his influence in Slot’s setup is undeniable. His pace, work rate, and technical ability have helped define a new era under the Dutch manager — one that culminated in Liverpool’s first league title since 2020.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nIf you’d told any Red back in August 2024 that Luis Díaz would finish the season with 16 goals, a Premier League medal, and Barcelona sniffing around, we’d have taken it in a heartbeat.\n\nThis is a player who gives everything — from relentless pressing to electric moments on the ball — and while he had a rough patch mid-season, who didn’t? Let’s not forget, during that tough run, he still ran himself into the ground for the shirt.\n\nAnd now we hear Sky Sports confirming that contract talks are imminent. It’s about time. You can’t win the Premier League, help push for the double, and still be on £55k a week while others are tripling that. Díaz deserves better, and we trust Arne Slot and the club’s hierarchy to make the right call.\n\nWe also have to be realistic — if we want to keep world-class talent, we need to pay like a world-class club. Barcelona can admire from afar, but they’re not in the financial shape to outmuscle us. Saudi interest? Maybe more dangerous, but Díaz doesn’t strike us as the type to take a payday over passion — especially not after lifting the league trophy.\n\nIf anything, this contract talk should be about rewarding a player who’s bought into the Slot vision from day one. Lock him down, show faith, and let him continue growing into one of our most decisive forwards.\n\nOne thing’s clear: with the right backing, Díaz could become a Liverpool legend. And that journey needs to continue at Anfield — not Camp Nou, and certainly not Riyadh."}

While the idea might seem premature, the reality is that elite clubs must futureproof ruthlessly. At 30, the Scotland captain remains influential, but with injuries creeping in and tactical evolution under way, eyes are scanning Europe for what comes next. Maxim De Cuyper, a name unfamiliar to most, has emerged as a genuine option—perhaps not the headline signing some might expect, but a player shaped to match modern football’s hybrid demands.\n\nAccording to Bence Bocsak of Anfield Watch, Liverpool view the 24-year-old Belgian as “an alternative option to Milos Kerkez,” should the Bournemouth man prove too expensive or sought-after. With a reported £45m+ price tag and heavyweight interest from Real Madrid and Chelsea, Kerkez is drifting out of reach. De Cuyper, by contrast, might represent value, versatility, and vision rolled into one.\n\nBelgian Engine, Modern Profile\n\nDe Cuyper’s profile is quietly impressive. A graduate of Club Brugge’s youth system, he initially broke through as a winger—a trait that colours much of his current play. His evolution through a two-year loan spell at Westerlo, and later as a full-back at Brugge, shows a footballer in tactical bloom. The left-footer has transitioned into a more traditional full-back role this past season but hasn’t shed the attacking instincts of his earlier years.\n\n“He won 10 of his 11 defensive duels against Manchester City and won the most duels (10) and tackles (3) in the first leg of Club Brugge’s tie against Aston Villa in the Champions League.”\n\nThat kind of performance doesn’t go unnoticed by a data-driven recruitment team like Liverpool’s. In fact, his numbers make compelling reading across both ends of the pitch.\n\nCreativity from Deep\n\nPerhaps the most tantalising aspect of De Cuyper’s game is his creativity. According to FBref, he ranks in the 99th percentile for progressive passes (7.44 per 90), expected assisted-goals (0.36 per 90), and shot-creating actions among full-backs outside Europe’s top five leagues. He doesn’t just defend well—he moves the ball forward with purpose, precision, and flair.\n\nIn that sense, he feels tailor-made for the hybrid demands of Liverpool’s current shape. Whether inverting into midfield or overlapping on the flank, De Cuyper appears to possess the balance of discipline and daring that Jürgen Klopp—and potentially Arne Slot—prioritise.\n\n“He’s definitely a player who ticks a lot of boxes for Liverpool. He’s capable of covering a lot of ground, create chances and thrive defensively.”\n\nMarket Value and Strategic Fit\n\nThis isn’t just about statistics. It’s about timing and opportunity. De Cuyper is approaching his peak years, playing regularly in European competition, and yet isn’t priced out of a move. That combination makes him a strategic fit, especially in a summer where Liverpool may need to spread their transfer spend wisely across multiple areas of the pitch.\n\nIn years gone by, this is exactly the kind of signing Liverpool made with confidence and conviction: identify upside early, act decisively, and allow a player to develop in a well-defined system. If Robertson is to be eased out gradually, De Cuyper offers a low-noise, high-ceiling alternative who won’t expect to start but might soon make himself impossible to drop.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nMaxim De Cuyper won’t have been on the radar for most Liverpool fans, but those who’ve seen how the club operates in the transfer market will recognise the pattern. This is what Liverpool do: find players before they become £70m superstars, not after. What’s exciting here is that the Belgian ticks the modern full-back boxes. He’s athletic, creative, and defensively solid—and, crucially, he seems capable of handling the demands of a high-press system.\n\nSome fans will naturally be sceptical, especially given how integral Andy Robertson has been over the years. But just as Robbo arrived from Hull as an under-the-radar pick, De Cuyper could be the next unheralded gem. His versatility is a real bonus too. With Liverpool shifting shapes more often and needing full-backs who can play inside and out, this isn’t just about finding a left-back—it’s about expanding tactical options.\n\nFor a reasonable fee and with the right coaching, De Cuyper could be another example of Liverpool thinking three steps ahead. If Kerkez proves too expensive or drifts towards Madrid or the Etihad, this looks like a very smart Plan B—if not Plan A in disguise."}

KGI/KPIインパクト大, 4. 顧客要望（複数社）, 5. 工数小 }}\n\nこれを rules に設定しておくことで、以降のAIとの対話において、常にこの**「プロジェクトの前提」**を考慮した回答を引き出しやすくなります。\n\n毎回「このプロジェクトでは…」と説明する手間が省けますし、判断基準の統一にも繋がると考えました。\n\n次に、具体的な要望が寄せられた際のフローです。\n\n例えば、ビジネスサイドから「管理画面に検索フィルタを追加したい（取引ステータスで絞り込みたい）」といった要望が来たと仮定します。\n\nここで、以下のプロンプトをCursorに入力します。\n\n### 💡 Cursor Prompt : REQUIREMENT_GATHER_SINGLE # コア情報以外のスクリプトは不要。表ではなく項目列挙で出力してください。 【入力データ】 - 要望ID ：{{ REQ-1234 }} - タイトル ：{{ 例: 管理画面に検索フィルタを追加 }} - 概要 ：{{ 取引ステータスで絞り込みたい }} 【タスク】 1. リポジトリを静的解析し、影響箇所を推定 - 画面 / クラス・メソッド / DB テーブル 2. **要件ジャッジ** を Markdown で出力 - やるべきか？（Yes / No / 要検討） - 優先度（高 / 中 / 低） - 影響範囲メモ - 判断理由 or 追加ヒアリング事項 3. 「要検討」の場合は **営業 / クライアント向けヒアリング依頼文** を生成\n\nここでのポイントは以下の3点です。\n\nコードベース（リポジトリ）を静的解析し、影響箇所をリストアップしてくれること。 これを手動で行うのは時間がかかり、見落としのリスクも伴います。AIの得意分野と言えるでしょう。\n\n事前に設定した rules （特に判断基準）と影響箇所情報に基づき、**「要件ジャッジ」**のドラフトを作成してくれること。 対応要否、優先度、その根拠といった初期アセスメントをAIが支援します。もちろん最終判断は人間が行いますが、判断材料が整理されているだけで効率は格段に向上します。\n\n判断に迷う場合（「要検討」）は、追加情報を得るためのヒアリング項目と、関係者（営業担当やクライアントなど）への依頼文面まで生成してくれること。 「何を確認すべきか？」を考える時間を短縮できるのは、実務上、非常に助かります。\n\nこの一連の流れにより、要望受け付けから影響範囲の特定、初期判断、ネクストアクション（ヒアリング）の明確化までが、かなり高速化されることが期待できます。\n\n\n\n具体的な実装方針を検討：詳細設計 ― 方針作成\n\nさて、「対応する」と判断された要望について、より具体的にどう実装するかを検討するフェーズです。\n\nここでもCursorの支援を活用します。\n\n### 💡 Cursor Prompt : DETAIL_POLICY # コア情報以外のスクリプトは省略。Markdown 見出し＋箇条書きで出力。 【タスク】 - 変更対象ファイル・関数 - ファイルパス / 関数名 / 変更概要 - データ設計方針 - 追加・変更・削除するテーブル/カラムと理由 - 画面設計方針（必要な場合のみ） - 判断材料不足時はヒアリング依頼文を末尾に追加\n\nここでは、前のステップで特定された影響箇所を基に、\n\nどのファイルのどの関数を、どのように変更する必要がありそうか？\n\nデータベーススキーマ（テーブル/カラム）に変更は必要か？必要であれば、どのような変更か？\n\nUI/UXの観点から、画面要素をどのように変更するのが適切か？\n\nといった、設計方針のドラフトを作成してもらいます。\n\nこれも、ゼロから考察するのではなく、AIが生成した提案をベースに人間がレビュー・修正を加える方が、圧倒的に効率的です。\n\nもし、この段階で設計を進める上で判断材料が不足している点があれば、AIがそれを指摘し、必要なヒアリング依頼文を生成してくれます。これも便利な点です。\n\n設計方針のドラフトが完成したら、次はチームメンバーや関係者とレビューを行い、内容を精査していく必要があります。\n\nそのためのレビュー用資料の準備も、Cursorに依頼します。\n\n### 💡 Cursor Prompt : REVIEW_PACKET # コア情報以外のスクリプトは不要。Markdown で簡潔に。 以下を最新版ドラフトに追加し、Markdown で提示してください。 - 処理フロー (mermaid) - 開発工数見積（タスク別時間 & 合計人日） - 未確定事項（要確認ラベル付き）\n\nここで生成を依頼するのは、\n\n処理フロー図（mermaid形式）：実装イメージの共有と認識合わせに有効です。\n\n開発工数見積もり：タスクを細分化し、それぞれの見積もり時間と合計人日を算出します（見積もり精度はAIの限界もあるため、最終的にはエンジニアの経験に基づいた調整が不可欠ですが、初期見積もりとしては有用です）。\n\n未確定事項リスト：「要確認」といったラベル付きでリスト化されるため、レビュー時に議論すべき点が明確になります。\n\nこれらの情報を、先に作成した設計方針ドラフトに追加してもらうことで、レビューに必要な情報が整理された形で得られます。これにより、認識齟齬の防止や議論の効率化が期待できます。\n\nそして最後に、ここまでのプロセスで生成・精査してきた情報を、最終的なドキュメントとして集約する作業です。\n\nこれも、もちろんCursorで効率化します。\n\n### 💡 Cursor Prompt : FINAL_DOC # 冗長なコード断片は省き、Markdown で統合。長すぎる場合は .md ファイルで出力。 - プロジェクトルール抜粋 - 要件ジャッジ結果 - 変更対象ファイル・関数リスト - データ設計方針 - 画面設計方針 - 処理フロー (mermaid) - 開発工数見積 - 未確定事項 & TODO\n\nこのプロンプトにより、最初に設定したプロジェクトルールから、要件判断、設計方針、処理フロー、工数見積もり、未確定事項・TODOリストまでが一貫性を持ってまとめられたドキュメントが生成されます。\n\nドキュメント作成の手間が大幅に削減されるのは、大きなメリットです。\n\n試してみた結果と考察\n\n実際にこのフローをいくつかの要望に対して適用してみたところ、要件定義プロセスの効率が明らかに向上したことを実感しています。\n\n時間短縮: 特に、影響範囲の調査やドキュメントの初期ドラフト作成にかかる時間が大幅に削減されました。\n\n精度向上: コードベースの静的解析により、人間では見落としがちな影響箇所を検出できるケースがありました。（この機能は強力です）\n\n属人化の軽減: ある程度標準化されたプロセスで進められるため、担当者によるアウトプット品質のばらつきを抑制しやすくなったと感じます。\n\nコミュニケーションコスト削減: 議論のベースとなる情報が整理されているため、関係者とのコミュニケーションがよりスムーズに進むようになりました。\n\nもちろん、AIが生成する内容はあくまで「ドラフト」や「提案」であり、必ず人間のエンジニアがその内容を精査し、最終的な判断を行う必要があります。これは言うまでもありません。\n\nしかし、煩雑な作業や定型的なタスクをAIに委譲することで、人間はより本質的な課題の特定、解決策の考案、技術的な意思決定といった、高度な領域に集中できるようになる。これは非常に大きな価値だと考えています。\n\nこれからのエンジニアとAIの協業\n\nAIツールの進化に伴い、「エンジニアの仕事はAIに奪われるのでは？」といった議論も聞かれます。\n\nしかし私は、むしろ逆の可能性を感じています。\n\n定型業務をAIに任せることで、エンジニアは、"}

Nigel Farage arranged a fireworks display and a party. The prime minister and the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch have both written post-mortem articles in Saturday's newspapers. Politicians often accuse journalists of a splash of hyperbole, but it would be a struggle to top the Tory leader's description of her party's results as a \"bloodbath.\" It was though, she insists in the Daily Telegraph, a bloodbath she was expecting, having been warned of just this when she was running to be Conservative leader last year. LIVE: Reform celebrates big wins in elections dubbed 'bloodbath' by Tories, as Starmer hits out at Farage\n\nSir Keir Starmer's language in the Times isn't quite as graphic. He repeats that \"I get it\" and said he wouldn't resort to the \"same old excuses\" used by prime ministers facing tough local elections. \"I feel the same sharp edge of fury at the way our country has been let down as people who voted on Thursday do,\" he writes, making reference to \"uncontrolled immigration, sewage in rivers\" and \"failing local services\". Two immediate practical questions arise out of these results. The first is how Labour and the Conservatives respond to what has happened – not least the rapid rise of Reform UK, but also the Liberal Democrats and to a lesser extent the Green Party. The second is how Reform adjusts to the realities of power – bluntly, whether they prove to be any good at it or not.\n\nThere is then a wider political question. The demolition of the duopoly in Westminster politics has been talked of before. Think the birth of the Social Democratic Party, or SDP, in 1981. There was the coalition government of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats between 2010 and 2015. In the 2019 European Parliament elections, the Conservatives and Labour only managed to cobble together 23% of the vote between them. And yet before and after each of these moments, one of the Westminster big two went on to win the next general election, often handsomely. Indeed, months after those European elections, the Conservatives won a big majority at Westminster. Two years earlier, the big two in the Commons swept up 82.4% of the vote combined. So it is wise to bring perspective to this discussion, rather than breathlessness. But it is wise, too, to acknowledge the sheer scale of this breakthrough by Reform UK. They went into these elections with the challenge of proving that they could match in votes what the opinion polls had suggested they could. They comfortably exceeded that high expectation which is why this is a profound moment in our contemporary politics. Senior Reform figures believe the primary driving motivation behind their surge was that most powerful of human emotions: betrayal. Betrayal, they argue, from both of Westminster's big beasts. So what happens next? Well, the pyrotechnics of modern politics continue, and not just in the field used by Reform UK for their celebratory party. And a final thought: if English politics feels splintered and noisy, remember Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland too. Next year, there are elections to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments. Reform are pretty excited about those elections as well. The Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru and others will, of course, be in the mix then too. The widening cacophony of political voices demanding our attention and endorsement could get louder yet."}

They Better Brace Themselves.", "fullContent": "Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nWelcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a newsletter that has written 3,400 kilos of words about politics, saving 258 million American lives.\n\nYou will not believe how much politics happened this week. President Donald Trump pissed off Canada so much that they elected another lib, and Trump is delighted. Amazon had a chance to break Trump politically, but got scared. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has the chance to take a committee chairmanship at long last, but committee chairmanships are for pikers. And Mike Waltz is taking on the Big Apple!\n\nLet’s begin with the fight over Medicaid cuts in the House, and what this big bill is really all about.\n\n1. Chip Roy\n\nThe Medicaid cuts are the point.\n\nCongressional Republicans have reached the moment they’ve been waiting for—writing up their sprawling bill to enact Trump’s legislative agenda—and are, at this moment, stuck. They can’t settle on a way to enact hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts that doesn’t scare the crap out of both moderate members and Trump. On SNAP benefits, another major target for cutting, they’re running into the same issue. It raises the question: Why are they forcing themselves to spin their wheels like this? They could find a way to get their tax cuts through accounting tricks or less controversial cuts. That’s what the Senate will end up doing, anyway.\n\nThe thing is, there are varying interpretations of the purpose of the “one, big beautiful bill.” The popular understanding is that Republicans want to renew trillions in tax cuts, and they need to find some spending cuts to lessen the deficit impact. But for conservatives, like Texas Rep. Chip Roy and other deficit hawks, the purpose of the bill is to rein in mandatory federal spending programs. They see this moment as a generational opportunity—perhaps the last they’ll get before a debt crisis hits—to do so. In a letter to their colleagues on Thursday trying to salvage proposed Medicaid cuts, Roy and other conservatives wrote, “If the House budget reconciliation package does not include structural Medicaid reform that achieves desired Republican outcomes, we will be setting up massive tax increases and benefit cuts in the future.” There’s been an intraparty battle brewing between those who view tax cuts as the point and those who view spending cuts as the point, and now it’s reaching a crescendo. We’d observe that the path of least resistance almost always wins in the end, which is why Roy is so distraught in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Mark Carney\n\nPublicity is publicity.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney won a full term in the country’s election this week, completing a shocking turnaround for the country’s Liberal Party, which looked doomed as recently as a few months ago. He defeated Conservatives’ supposed PM-in-waiting, Pierre Poilievre. Poilievre represented the closest thing to major-party MAGAism in Canada, and until recently, he appeared to be cruising to power. In the end, Poilievre didn’t even hold on to his seat. What changed over the past few months was Donald Trump, who’s infuriated a nation of largely polite people with his strange efforts to destroy Canada economically and then annex it. This didn’t create a receptive electoral environment for Trumpian right-wing populism in the country.\n\nDid Trump feel rebuked? Of course not. In an interview with the Atlantic published this week, Trump was bragging about his effect. “You know, until I came along, remember that the conservative was leading by 25 points,” he said. “Then I was disliked by enough of the Canadians that I’ve thrown the election into a close call, right? I don’t even know if it’s a close call.” He’s simply pleased with his ability to have shifted a race so quickly. The direction of the shift doesn’t matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Jeff Bezos\n\nSorry, sir—won’t happen again.\n\nEarly in the week, Punchbowl News reported that Amazon “would soon show how much Trump’s tariffs are adding to the price of each product.” We don’t know that there’s a single more powerful move a private sector company could make to destroy Trump’s presidency right now than Amazon breaking out tariff costs at checkout. The White House would treat it as a declaration of war—and it did, at first, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt immediately calling the move a “hostile and political act” while a “pissed” Trump called up Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos to complain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the report didn’t make sense. Don’t get us wrong—it would make great sense for Amazon to allow retailers to show consumers why their prices are up. But this is not the path Bezos has chosen. Instead, he’s chosen to protect his business interests and federal contracts by sucking up to Trump personally, whether that’s through Mar-a-Lago visits, inauguration appearances, donations, or muzzling the major newspaper he owns. He’s not going to abruptly change course while Trump still has years left in his term. The whole dustup ended quickly, with Amazon saying such a plan was never in consideration for its main site. One subsidiary had thought about making this change, but won’t, and will be imprisoned in CECOT for its thought crime. A decent pen simply costs $399 now, and there is no reason for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nDoes she want the committee job anymore?\n\nLate last fall, veteran Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly defeated New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a closely watched race to serve as top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. It left a bad taste in the mouths of those Democrats who felt the party needed a young, galvanizing face in this prominent position—which involves an equal mix of serious investigative work and flashy cable news appearances—rather than a septuagenarian in poor health. Connolly announced this week, though, that he would step aside from the post after a few months (and wouldn’t run for reelection) because his cancer had returned.\n\nSo, is AOC now a lock to take control of the committee? The biggest issue is whether she’s still interested. Since the last committee election, AOC has been touring the country to packed audiences in the tens of thousands, serving as a primary face of the reawakening resistance to Donald Trump. Her star has arguably never been brighter. So does she really want to commit herself to serving atop a House committee, and all of the duties that entails, when she could be selling out the Superdome? Or laying the groundwork for … you know … a bigger job in a few short years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Mike Waltz\n\nMoving on to bigger and brighter group chats.\n\nKnives were out for national security adviser Mike Waltz well before he invited a journalist onto a group chat to discuss classified bombing plans in Yemen. Waltz always stuck out as too hawkish for the MAGA national security team; Signalgate, more than anything, provided his enemies an opportunity to push him out. But in the immediate aftermath, Waltz’s job was spared because Trump didn’t want to give the media a win so early in his administration. Now that it’s been more than a month since the episode, though, Trump can finally eject him from the building and argue that it was an independent decision. Trump did so on Thursday but gave Waltz a soft landing, announcing that he would nominate him to serve as ambassador to the United Nations. (That’s the job that was originally given to New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, before Trump decided to keep her voting in the House of Representatives for eternity.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis works out all right for everyone involved: Trump gets to provide some accountability for Signalgate without fully giving in to the haters; his MAGA foreign policy team has taken out potentially the last Russia is bad buzzkill in the building; and Waltz gets a Senate-confirmed position and a nice apartment in Manhattan. Oh, and while we’re talking about his Senate confirmation? Democrats will get a lengthy, televised opportunity to run through Signalgate again.\n\n6. Shri Thanedar\n\nDon’t you just love primary season?\n\nShri Thanedar is a second-term Congressman representing Detroit. He is a wealthy Indian American in a plurality Black district, and he is constantly getting primaried. He already has two primary challengers, one a former state senator and another a state representative. What this means, then, is that it’s time for Thanedar to attempt some stunts. On Monday, the same day that state Rep. Donavan McKinney announced his primary campaign in the district, Thanedar introduced seven articles of impeachment against Trump. This was a significant source of irritation to House Democratic leaders, who view it as a distraction, as well as to a few members who were surprised to see they’d been listed as co-sponsors. Thanedar has further used his official office budget (i.e., taxpayer money) to advertise his impeachment efforts on billboards in his district. That’s not a new tactic for him, either; he was by far the top spender of official office money on ads in 2024. In an interview with the Detroit News, Thanedar said of his impeachment articles that “my duty to my constituents is that I speak out when injustice happens and not wait for what is politically right or what’s the opportune time to do it.” We don’t know, it seems an awful lot like he waited for the opportune time to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Dick Durbin\n\nIt’s not retirement time yet.\n\nSenate Democrats had a troubling episode earlier this week. They were forcing a vote to kill the national emergency Trump invoked for his “Liberation Day” tariffs. This is something they had a majority for; a similar resolution addressing the Canada tariffs passed earlier this year with four Republican votes. This, time, though, it didn’t work. The vote failed in a 49–49 tie as two supporters missed the vote. Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse was at a conference in South Korea—something Democratic leaders knew about—while Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell was out sick. Not only did that vote fail, but then Vice President J.D. Vance showed up to cast a tiebreaker on a subsequent vote to ensure the resolution couldn’t get a revote later on. Democrats tried to spin this afterward as a secret political win for them, because they’d forced Republicans to go on the record owning the tariffs. But losing a vote you were supposed to win looks an awful lot more like a screwup to us. The vote came a week after the Democratic whip, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, announced that he would retire at the end of the term. Well, how should we put this? Some of the quotes he gave after the vote—“I don’t think anything went wrong. We just needed more votes”—suggest that he may already have one foot in a Fort Myers timeshare."}

It goes like this:\n\nGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\n\nThere’s an important lesson here — one that’s very often glossed over…\n\nWhen a chaotic reality is swirling around us, we often try to relieve our anxiety by exerting our will over external things we cannot control.\n\nIt helps us stave off one of the most dreaded feelings: complete powerlessness.\n\nWith that in mind, I have good news and bad news.\n\nThe bad news is that generally speaking, almost everything is outside your control. What other people do, whether it will rain tomorrow, whether or not your efforts will be appreciated — all of these outcomes depend on factors that aren’t YOU.\n\nBut that’s also the good news.\n\nThe friction and frustration created by trying to change things you cannot change is the crucible where a ton of unhappiness is born. Accepting that most things are outside your influence gives you explicit permission to let them unfold as they may.\n\nStoic philosopher Epictetus put it this way:\n\n“Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our actions.”\n\nOvercoming the “three big un’s” that so many of us struggle with daily — unhappiness, unconvinced things will ever change, unsure what to do next — begins with understanding what you can control and what you cannot.\n\nThe mental shift here is not easy. Most of us have spent a lifetime worrying about things that we can’t control. Society practically encourages this. For most, it’s a bona fide habit — one that should be replaced with a healthy understanding of how much we can actually change. Again though, it’s hard to get your mind wrapped around all this when you’re constantly hearing…\n\n“Why don’t you just get over it?” or “Just let it go.”\n\nWe’ve all heard some flavor of this advice before. And it passes the sniff test, to a certain extent.\n\nI mean, “time heals all wounds,” right? Well, yes… sort of. But wounds heal differently depending on how they’re treated.\n\nLeft alone, a gash in your skin will leave a large scar and be vulnerable to injury again in the future. This is why we get stitches — it helps the wound heal in a way that limits the chance of re-injury down the road.\n\nEmotional wounds work the same way. Given enough time, most emotional pain will diminish — that’s true. But…\n\nJust “Getting Over It” Leaves Scars\n\nIn the emotional sense, scars equal baggage — baggage we carry with us into every aspect of our lives. These scars grow and accumulate until one day you wake up suffering from one or more of the “three un’s” (unhappiness, unconvinced things will ever change, unsure what to do next).\n\nSo, don’t get over it. Go through it, one step at a time.\n\nHonestly, I understand the desire to “get over” difficult experiences or situations rather than facing them. Revisiting painful memories or facing our present demons is really, really hard. And we as human beings are hard-wired to not cause ourselves pain.\n\nHowever, as our parents taught us, ignoring a problem doesn’t make it go away.\n\nAnd in addition to the scars, to ignore or downplay a wound puts you at risk for infection, emotionally as well as physically.\n\nUnresolved issues in your life take up residence in your mind and influence your decisions, your relationships, and your attitudes. They rob you of your happiness and potential.\n\nOf course, doing the hard yet necessary things to resolve your issues and heal your wounds can feel impossible. This is how Marc and I felt a decade ago when we were knocked down and stuck in a rut after simultaneously losing two loved ones — including my dear brother — to self-harm and illness. It was nearly impossible to move anywhere significant when we didn’t feel we had the strength to push forward.\n\nSo if you’re feeling this way now — like it’s impossible to make significant progress today — you aren’t wrong for feeling what you feel. In many cases, you’re right: significant progress comes gradually with time and consistency. It’s all about taking one tiny positive step at a time, and staying the course.\n\nConsider the following section, which is an excerpt from “The Good Morning Journal”:\n\nThe Power of Tiny Changes\n\nThink about the fact that it only takes a one degree change in temperature to convert water to vapor, or ice to water. It’s such a tiny change — just one step in a different direction — and yet the results are dramatic. A tiny change can make all the difference in the world.\n\nNow consider another example where a tiny change is compounded by time and distance. Perhaps you’re trying to travel somewhere specific, but you’re off course by just one tiny degree in the wrong direction…\n\nAfter one mile, you would be off course by over 92 feet.\n\nIf you were trying to travel from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., you would land near Baltimore, Maryland, over 42 miles away from your desired destination.\n\nTraveling around the world from Washington, D.C. back to Washington D.C., you’d miss by 435 miles and end up landing near Boston instead.\n\nIn a spaceship traveling to the moon, a one-degree error would have you missing the moon by over 4,100 miles.\n\nYou get the idea — over time and distance, a mere one-degree change in course makes a significant difference…\n\nThis same philosophy holds true in various aspects of our lives. The tiniest and most fundamental things we do each day — positive and negative alike — can make all the difference. They either bring us closer or farther away from where we ultimately want to be. And yet, we mostly ignore this reality. We default to behaving as if our daily actions won’t ever be significant enough. Or, again, we try to exert control over the bigger things we have no control over.\n\nThink about it…\n\nHow many people uphold unhealthy and unproductive habits?\n\nHow many people wait around and procrastinate on the next positive step?\n\nHow many people live every day of their lives moving one degree away from where they ultimately want to be?\n\nDon’t be one of them!\n\nTruth be told, everyone travels 24 hours a day whether they’re moving in the right direction or not.\n\nHow much richer would your life be if you committed yourself to making just one degree of effort toward improving something about your situation each day?\n\nAnd even though it will surely be harder than doing nothing, it doesn’t even have to be anything that hard. You just need to muster up the courage to break free from the status quo and take one small, fundamental step forward today, and then do it again tomorrow.\n\nPick something tiny and productive to improve upon, and then make it a daily habit.\n\nDoing so will make all the difference in the world — it could literally change your life — just a few short weeks down the road.\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nYes, it’s your turn to focus on those fundamental yet life-changing steps today. So give yourself some credit right now for how far you’ve come, and then take the next step forward.\n\nBut before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂\n\nAlso, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week."}

For users sensitive to flicker, this issue has long been a source of discomfort, leading to symptoms such as eye strain, headaches, and fatigue. With competitors already making progress in this area, there is growing anticipation for Google to introduce a solution that prioritizes both eye comfort and accessibility.\n\nUnderstanding PWM Dimming and Its Impact\n\nPWM dimming is a common method used to control brightness in OLED displays. It operates by rapidly switching the display’s backlight on and off at specific frequencies. While this technique helps maintain color accuracy at lower brightness levels, it can also introduce flicker, particularly at lower PWM frequencies.\n\nCurrently, Google Pixel devices use PWM frequencies ranging from 240 Hz to 480 Hz. Although these rates are considered standard, they can still cause discomfort for individuals sensitive to flicker, especially those who spend extended periods using their devices. As OLED displays dominate the premium smartphone market, addressing this issue has become a priority for manufacturers aiming to enhance user experience and accessibility.\n\nExploring Industry Solutions: High-Frequency PWM and DC Dimming\n\nSeveral smartphone manufacturers have already taken steps to mitigate the effects of PWM dimming. Two primary solutions have emerged as industry standards:\n\nHigh-Frequency PWM Dimming: Some brands, such as Vivo and Honor, have implemented PWM frequencies exceeding 2,000 Hz. This significantly reduces the perceptibility of flicker, making it less likely to cause discomfort for users.\n\nSome brands, such as Vivo and Honor, have implemented PWM frequencies exceeding 2,000 Hz. This significantly reduces the perceptibility of flicker, making it less likely to cause discomfort for users. DC Dimming: This approach adjusts the voltage supplied to the display rather than relying on rapid on-off cycles. While it eliminates flicker entirely, it can sometimes compromise color accuracy at lower brightness levels.\n\nTo address the trade-offs between these methods, some manufacturers have introduced hybrid dimming systems. These systems combine high-frequency PWM with DC dimming, aiming to deliver both visual comfort and high display quality. Such innovations are setting new benchmarks for user-friendly display technology.\n\nWhat the Pixel 10 Pro XL Could Offer\n\nThe Pixel 10 Pro XL presents an opportunity for Google to address these challenges and potentially lead the way in display innovation. Several advancements could be introduced to enhance the device’s usability and appeal:\n\nIncreasing PWM frequencies to reduce flicker visibility, aligning with competitors that have adopted high-frequency PWM dimming.\n\nIncorporating a hybrid dimming system that combines the benefits of DC dimming and high-frequency PWM for optimal performance and user comfort.\n\nIntroducing a dedicated flicker reduction mode, similar to features offered by brands like Motorola, to provide users with greater control over display settings.\n\nBy implementing these features, Google could significantly improve user comfort while reinforcing its reputation for innovation and accessibility. Such advancements would not only enhance the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s appeal but also set a new standard for display technology within the Android ecosystem.\n\nThe Importance of Eye Comfort and Accessibility\n\nReducing screen flicker is more than a technical improvement—it is a vital step toward greater accessibility. For individuals with visual sensitivities or conditions such as migraines, flicker-free displays can make a substantial difference in daily usability. By addressing this issue, Google could broaden its audience and demonstrate a commitment to inclusive design.\n\nThis focus on eye comfort aligns with broader trends in the tech industry. Features like blue light filters, adaptive brightness, and dark modes have already become standard in modern smartphones. Tackling PWM-related flicker would be a logical next step, further enhancing the user experience and reducing screen fatigue for all users.\n\nLooking Ahead: Industry Expectations for the Pixel 10 Pro XL\n\nAlthough Google has not yet confirmed specific details about the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s display technology, there is cautious optimism among users and industry experts. The Pixel series has consistently pushed boundaries in smartphone innovation, and addressing PWM dimming concerns would represent a natural progression in its evolution.\n\nAs competitors continue to refine their display technologies, the Pixel 10 Pro XL has the potential to stand out by prioritizing user comfort and accessibility. Whether through high-frequency PWM dimming, hybrid systems, or entirely new solutions, Google has an opportunity to redefine expectations for premium smartphone displays. By doing so, the company could not only enhance its product lineup but also contribute to broader advancements in display technology that benefit the entire industry.\n\nFind more information on Google Pixel 10 Pro XL by browsing our extensive range of articles, guides and tutorials.\n\nSource & Image Credit: Demon’s Tech\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

In this way, “hanami biyori” can mean “perfect weather for flower-viewing”, and “matcha biyori” can mean “perfect day for matcha”, and, in the instance of this new product from Ghibli specialty chain Donguri Kyowakoku, “ichirin biyori”, which means “perfect day for a single flower”.\n\nThe product goes by the full name “Mononoke Hime Ichirinzashi Kodama no Ichirin Biyori” which translates as “Princess Mononoke Single Flower Vase Kodama’s Perfect Day for a Single Flower“. It does a good job of describing the product in detail, while also capturing a sense of poetic whimsy in the title, and it features not one but two kodama forest spirits from Princess Mononoke.\n\nWhile the product is designed to hold a single flower, the kodama appear to be sitting on two tree stumps with gorgeous details that capture the magical wonder of the forest, complete with ferns, mushrooms, butterflies and what looks to be a hidden mouse.\n\nThe kodama are also beautifully detailed, with expressions that give them a unique sense of character.\n\nWhile they’re beautiful to look at in the light, they take on a mysterious quality at night, when their phosphorescence makes them glow in the dark.\n\nTheir true beauty, however, is revealed when a single-stemmed flower is popped into the vase. That’s when the kodama look as if they’re gazing up at the beauty of nature, and perhaps saying to each other, “ichirin biyori”.\n\nThe unique vase is a wonderful way to bring the beauty of nature into your home, and it can be purchased at Donguri Kyowakoku stores and online, priced at 5,500 yen (US$38.48). If you’d like to add even more kodama to your collection, this range of glow-in-the-dark figures is ready to receive your love…and bask in the beauty of your flower.\n\nSource, images: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

The suit claims state and city laws labeled as \"sanctuary\" policies are dangerous and hurting the Trump Administration-led efforts to deport people who are here illegally.\n\nDonald Trump onstage in October 2024 during a presidential campaign rally at Gaylord Rockies Resort in Aurora. RJ Sangosti/The Denver Post via Getty Images\n\nThe lawsuit was filed Friday in federal court in Denver and it states: \"The United States has well-established, preeminent, and preemptive authority to regulate immigration matters.\" It specifically mentions the controversial apartment complex in Aurora, which President Trump claimed last year had been taken over by a Venezuelan gang. Justice Department attorneys argue Colorado's policies allowed Tren de Aragua to seize control of the building.\n\nLocal officials have called Trump's claims that the gang had taken over large swaths of the city exaggerated, but acknowledged the apartment complex was terrorized, including by people linked to Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe lawsuit calls out city ordinances and state laws like the one blocking local law enforcement agencies from helping federal immigration authorities. It claims Denver and Colorado's policies \"by intent and design interfere with and discriminate against the Federal Government's enforcement of federal immigration law,\" as stated in the lawsuit's complaint.\n\nThe suit asks the court to rule that those laws are illegal and a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIt lists the following people as defendants:\n\n- Gov. Jared Polis\n\n- Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser\n\n- Denver Mayor Mike Johnston\n\n- Denver Sheriff Elias Diggins\n\nA spokesperson for the governor's office responded to the lawsuit, saying they \"will not comment on the merits of the lawsuit\" but declared that Colorado is not a \"sanctuary state.\"\n\n\"The State of Colorado works with local, state and federal law enforcement regularly and we value our partnerships with local, county and federal law enforcement agencies to make Colorado safer. If the courts say that any Colorado law is not valid then we will follow the ruling,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nA Denver mayor's office spokesperson released a comment as well, saying the city \"will not be bullied or blackmailed, least of all by an administration that has little regard for the law and even less for the truth.\" It went on to say that \"Denver follows all laws local, state, and federal and stands ready to defend its values.\"\n\nIn March, Johnston traveled to Washington, D.C., to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about the city's policies regarding undocumented immigrants. Republican representatives grilled Johnston and mayors of Boston, Chicago and New York and said the cities' policies of not handing over such people who are picked up for crimes are putting police at risk and the general public as well.\n\nA spokesperson for the Colorado Attorney General's Office released a statement saying their office \"is committed to defending Colorado law and has done so successfully in the past in this area. We stand ready to do so again.\"\n\nIn February, several local governments across the U.S. filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its crackdown on cities with sanctuary city policies. The president signed an executive order earlier this week calling on the Justice Department to investigate sanctuary cities that don't cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration policies in an effort to withhold federal funding from them.\n\nThere is no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited local cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces U.S. immigration laws nationwide but seeks state and local help, particularly for large-scale deportations, and requests that police and sheriffs alert ICE to people it wants to deport and hold them until federal officers take custody.\n\nThe Department of Justice has filed similar lawsuits against Chicago and Rochester, New York."}

The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nKLSE:PETRONM Earnings and Revenue History May 3rd 2025\n\nAn Unusual Tax Situation\n\nPetron Malaysia Refining & Marketing Bhd reported a tax benefit of RM4.9m, which is well worth noting. This is meaningful because companies usually pay tax rather than receive tax benefits. We're sure the company was pleased with its tax benefit. However, the devil in the detail is that these kind of benefits only impact in the year they are booked, and are often one-off in nature. In the likely event the tax benefit is not repeated, we'd expect to see its statutory profit levels drop, at least in the absence of strong growth.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Petron Malaysia Refining & Marketing Bhd's Profit Performance\n\nAs we have already discussed Petron Malaysia Refining & Marketing Bhd reported that it received a tax benefit, rather than paying tax, in the last year. As a result we don't think its profit result, which includes that tax-boost, is a good guide to its sustainable profit levels. Because of this, we think that it may be that Petron Malaysia Refining & Marketing Bhd's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power. Sadly, its EPS was down over the last twelve months. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. For example, we've found that Petron Malaysia Refining & Marketing Bhd has 3 warning signs (2 are significant!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Petron Malaysia Refining & Marketing Bhd's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

MCU mania was at an all-time high back in 2015; fresh off the critically acclaimed one-two punch of Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel was on top of the mountain as they kept comic nerds and general audiences invested in the teases for Thanos and the ongoing Infinity Saga. But after Avengers: Age of Ultron, there was a bit of concern that the franchise was going through some growing pains.\n\nAge of Ultron wasn’t hated, mind you. It received mostly positive reviews and was a big financial success . But as the franchise moved forward with more beloved films like Captain America: Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, and the two-part finale of Infinity War and Endgame, Age of Ultron has been relegated to history as the “just okay” Avengers sequel. However, looking back ten years later, the film stands out from the MCU pack as one of the more dramatically ambitious Marvel films, and is perhaps the only one that makes the Avengers feel like a regular part of the universe instead of a team that only shows up for massive events. Let’s take a look at why the MCU should’ve taken a lot more from Age of Ultron.\n\nPlay\n\nThe Weight of Your Failure\n\nBefore we begin, let’s get one thing straight: Age of Ultron is a mess. It has way too many moving pieces, there isn’t enough runtime for everything it tries to cram in, and it’s a startlingly inelegant feature, whipping from place to place and struggling to find a consistent tone. It’s a movie that is practically buckling at the seams between writer-director Joss Whedon’s narrative sensibilities and its larger franchise obligations. Yet despite these not-insignificant problems, Age of Ultron has always been better than the sum of its parts, and that largely comes down to how it’s one of the few big ticket MCU films that places the emphasis on the anxieties and relationships of its characters over feeling like an event designed to rock the cinematic universe.\n\nBeing the middle entry in the Avengers “trilogy” (if we’re semi-cheating and considering Infinity War and Endgame as two parts of one giant movie) was both a blessing and a curse for Age of Ultron. There needed to be a direct sequel to The Avengers, but the larger machinations that had been set in place in regards to Thanos and the Infinity Stones were instead being left for the big finale. When Thanos was first teased in the mid-credits scene of the first film, many fans assumed the Mad Titan would be the villain of Avengers 2. So when Age of Ultron’s title was announced the following year, there was a mix of excitement and confusion. Ultron is one of the Avengers’ most prominent antagonists, if not the archenemy of the team as a whole, but how much of an effect could he really have if we knew he was merely a lead-in to Thanos?\n\nAge of Ultron wisely dismisses the idea that any of its principal characters are in mortal danger and instead focuses on digging deeper into what makes them tick. Tony Stark has become a frenzied neurotic terrified of the oncoming cosmic storm. Bruce Banner is desperate to reach out for a more intimate connection despite still not being convinced he’s not a threat to everyone he cares about. Hell, this is probably the only film in the franchise that makes an effort to give depth to Clint Barton , dramatizing him as a man among gods who nevertheless feels responsible for keeping this team of oversized personalities in one piece. Add in the entire dark side to redemption arcs for newcomers Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, and Age of Ultron has more dramatic meat for its characters than most of its MCU brethren.\n\nBut if we really want to dissect what makes the film work, we have to dig into one of its most controversial aspects: the big bad bot himself.\n\nWhich Marvel hero are you most surprised isn't appearing in Avengers: Doomsday? Wolverine Spider-Man Hulk She-Hulk Storm Jean Grey Star-Lord Captain Marvel Monica Rambeau Ms. Marvel The Hawkeyes Wong Doctor Strange Other (let us know in the comments) Answer See Results\n\nEveryone Creates the Thing They Dread\n\nDespite being based on one of the Marvel universe’s most prominent villains in the comics, the MCU’s take on Ultron hasn’t penetrated the cultural consciousness in the same way Loki or Thanos have. Part of that is a lack of exposure; Tom Hiddleston’s Loki has made numerous appearances in MCU projects, and Thanos was the main villain of two massive films after several teases beforehand. But even taking that into account, MCU Ultron had a decidedly mixed reception from fans, even if James Spader’s slithery line delivery is second to none. However, part of that lukewarm welcome comes down to a misunderstanding of who Ultron actually is in the comics, and what type of character he’s supposed to be.\n\nMany fans lamented that Ultron was a sardonic trash-talker, just as quick with sarcastic remarks and random philosophical musings as he was with laser beams. Numerous social media comments have been written by comic fans claiming they wanted a more “accurate” Ultron who was a cold, calculating menace with no emotion whatsoever. But this isn’t really what Ultron is like in the books at all. Ultron has always stood out from other artificial intelligence villains in fiction by being a character who thinks he’s driven by logic, but is actually one of the most petulant and emotionally stunted villains in Marvel lore. This comes down to the fact that his brain waves are based on his creator: in the source material, that’s Henry Pym aka Ant-Man, but in the film, it’s Tony Stark.\n\n“ We’re dealing with Stark's son, not Pym’s\n\nIn the comics, Ultron is an Oedipal nightmare who isn’t sure if he wants to kill his father or prove that he’s better than him. He wants to have sex with his “mother” Janet van Dyne ( no, really ), despises his “children” like the Vision and Jocasta for turning on him, and in the excellent 2015 graphic novel Rage of Ultron , admits that he’s a manifestation of Pym’s hatred of others for loving him. MCU Ultron isn’t a direct representation of those traits, but that’s because we’re dealing with Stark's son, not Pym’s. When seen as a dark reflection of Tony, Ultron’s severe superiority complex, mockingly cynical personality, and strange fixation on God and creation myths make a lot more sense. Ultron hates his creator, himself, and the world at large for his own imperfections, unable to process that wrestling with his darker impulses that derive from his ego is what makes Tony Stark a hero. Instead, Ultron doubles down on them, in the mistaken belief that his warped idea of “evolution” will save the world when it will only leave it in ruins.\n\nYet Age of Ultron’s most important quality is the way it treats the titular super team, a way that no Marvel film before or since has: as an everyday thing.\n\nPeace in our Time\n\nAge of Ultron is the only MCU movie starring the Avengers where the Avengers exist at both the beginning and end. Sure, they go through some trials and tribulations and shuffle the roster somewhat, but the Avengers, as an enterprise, exist in the present tense. They have a headquarters, go on missions together, and generally seem to like each other. Despite nearly every MCU film referencing the team or featuring at least one character who’s been a member of it, the Avengers rarely seem to actually “be around” in the MCU. They came together in the first film, were absent from each other’s Phase 2 sequels, had collapsed by Civil War, were still scattered for Infinity War, and were essentially over after Endgame. Even though the MCU is structured around the Avengers brand, the team’s place within the wider universe has rarely been all that coherent.\n\nYet in Age of Ultron, you can see a version of the MCU where that wasn’t the case. The party scene where the main cast and some of their supporting characters all hang out and interact like normal people is one of the best scenes in the franchise, and it’s because of how low stakes it is. Yes, we love the Avengers because they’re superheroes, but the reason they truly resonate with audiences is because they’re also interesting characters. But when going through their journey across the Infinity Saga, there were so few times where the movies slowed down to remind us of that basic humanity, that the Avengers had everyday lives beyond stopping bad guys and saving the world. Not allowing the audience to soak in the interpersonal dynamics of these larger than life heroes when they’re not being larger than life is what has kept many of the post-Endgame films from capturing the same emotional highs as the Infinity Saga.\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron Character Posters View 12 Images\n\nFor all of the perfectly fair criticisms that can be lobbied at Age of Ultron for being overstuffed, weirdly paced, or tonally inconsistent, it’s a movie that has an actual beating heart at the center of it. The conflict in philosophy between Steve and Tony at the farm is perhaps the most perfect illustration of their differences in the franchise. Ultron’s villain speech as he lifts Sokovia into the sky is practically Shakespearean. The final confrontation between Vision and the last Ultron bot is one of the MCU’s most beautifully profound scenes, a rare moment between two characters that’s still and patient enough to engender actual melancholy instead of manufactured catharsis. It will never be a perfect movie, but as time goes on, it has only become a more interesting one. That the MCU strived for the former instead of the latter is perhaps the franchise’s greatest mistake."}

I am too tired.” She then affirmed:\n\n“I have three children, I’m good.”\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt attends the 2018 Fox Network Upfront at Wollman Rink, Central Park on May 14, 2018.

Better to not risk it.\n\nBesides, several years ago, Hewitt stated that she was “pretty sure” that three would be enough.\n\nIn the meantime, she can just wear a very realistic prosthetic baby bump when she’s working."}

The short clip features HSR's Blade and Honkai Impact 3rd's Kiana, seemingly readying themselves to battle each other with adorable creatures.\n\nConsidering that this announcement is coming hot off the heels of the Honkai Star Rail devs registering a Honkai: Nexus Anima trademark and setting up multiple social media accounts under the same name, we believe this surprise PV is linked to the mystery title. It's also likely tied to the Hoyoverse job ad for a Honkai auto chess game featuring \"Destined Spirits\" – 'anima' roughly translates to spirit or soul.\n\nGiven that characters like Honkai Star Rail's Welt and Honkai Star Rail's Acheron appear across multiple Honkai titles, it's not too surprising to see Blade and Kiana together, but the scenario is certainly like nothing we've seen from the series before. With Kiana's pudding dog creature and Blade's armored hound crashing into one another, it looks like something from a game like Pokémon, which I am 100% here for.\n\nSeveral fans have already speculated that this game will most closely resemble Pokémon Masters EX, DeNA's Pokémon gacha game where trainers and their Pokémon come as package deals known as sync pairs. We really don't have much to go on from the 25-second clip, but hopefully, we'll see a mix of Honkai Star Rail characters and Honkai Impact characters on the roster.\n\nThat's everything we know about the new Honkai game so far.

Throughout the 80s and 90s, I wrote eleven novels and many stories—some of which were nominated for (and won) prizes, one of which was made into a not-very-good movie by Paramount, and all of which are still available hardbound and via download on Amazon. At the same time I taught creative writing at a couple of universities and worked brief stints in Hollywood. It looked as if teaching and writing more novels, stories, reviews, and scripts was going to be my life. Then HP called me up out of the blue, and everything changed. I’ve told this story several times, but it’s worth repeating because the second half of my life hinged on it. I’d been an audiophile since I was in my mid-teens, and did all the things a young audiophile did back then, buying what I could afford (mainly on the used market), hanging with audiophile friends almost exclusively, and poring over J. Gordon Holt’s Stereophile and Harry Pearson’s Absolute Sound. Come the early 90s, I took a year and a half off from writing my next novel and, music lover that I was, researched and wrote a book (now out of print) about my favorite classical records on the RCA label. Somehow Harry found out about that book (The RCA Bible), got my phone number (which was unlisted, so to this day I don’t know how he unearthed it), and called. Since I’d been reading him since I was a kid, I was shocked. “I feel like I’m talking to God,” I told him. “No,” said he, in that deep rumbling voice of his, “God is talking to you.” I laughed, of course. But in a way it worked out to be true, since from almost that moment forward I’ve devoted my life to writing about audio and music—first for Harry at TAS, then for Fi (the magazine I founded alongside Wayne Garcia), and in the new millennium at TAS again, when HP hired me back after Fi folded. It’s been an odd and, for the most part, serendipitous career, in which things have simply come my way, like Harry’s phone call, without me planning for them. For better and worse I’ve just gone with them on instinct and my talent to spin words, which is as close to being musical as I come."}

This feature could redefine multitasking on mobile devices, bridging the gap between smartphones and desktop-like functionality. However, these advancements may come at the cost of compatibility with older devices, reflecting Apple’s strategy of aligning innovative hardware with software for optimal performance. The video below from SaranByte gives us more details on what to expect.\n\nStage Manager: Expanding to iPhones?\n\nFor the first time, Apple may bring Stage Manager—a feature currently exclusive to iPads—to select iPhones. This version is expected to be tailored specifically for USB-C-enabled models, taking advantage of the port’s faster data transfer speeds and enhanced capabilities.\n\nWhat is Stage Manager? Stage Manager is a multitasking tool that allows users to manage multiple app windows simultaneously and connect to external displays for a desktop-like experience.\n\nStage Manager is a multitasking tool that allows users to manage multiple app windows simultaneously and connect to external displays for a desktop-like experience. What’s new for iPhones? On iPhones, Stage Manager could enable advanced multitasking when paired with an external monitor, moving beyond basic screen mirroring to offer a more dynamic and productive workflow.\n\nOn iPhones, Stage Manager could enable advanced multitasking when paired with an external monitor, moving beyond basic screen mirroring to offer a more dynamic and productive workflow. Limitations: The iPhone version is expected to be more restricted compared to its iPad counterpart, focusing on newer devices with USB-C connectivity to ensure smooth performance.\n\nThis development signals Apple’s intent to expand productivity tools across its ecosystem. However, it also underscores the company’s focus on using the latest hardware to unlock new features, leaving older devices behind in the process.\n\niPadOS 19: Bringing iPads Closer to Desktops\n\nApple continues to refine the iPad experience with iPadOS 19, introducing features that further blur the line between tablets and traditional desktop environments. These updates aim to maximize the potential of the M-series chips, enhancing the iPad’s versatility as a productivity tool.\n\nMac-like Menu Bar: iPads connected to the Magic Keyboard may gain a macOS-style menu bar, streamlining navigation and improving workflow management.\n\niPads connected to the Magic Keyboard may gain a macOS-style menu bar, streamlining navigation and improving workflow management. Enhanced Multitasking: Updates to app window management and task switching are designed to make multitasking more intuitive and efficient, catering to users who rely on iPads for professional tasks.\n\nUpdates to app window management and task switching are designed to make multitasking more intuitive and efficient, catering to users who rely on iPads for professional tasks. Debates on Convergence: These changes reignite discussions about whether iPads should eventually run macOS instead of a modified iPadOS, as the functionality gap between the two platforms continues to narrow.\n\nWhile Apple has resisted merging iPadOS and macOS, the gradual introduction of desktop-like features suggests a long-term strategy of convergence. This approach allows Apple to maintain the iPad’s unique identity while pushing its capabilities closer to those of a traditional computer.\n\nVisual Overhaul: A Unified Design Language\n\nBoth iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 are expected to feature a redesigned user interface inspired by VisionOS, Apple’s operating system for its Vision Pro headset. These updates aim to create a cohesive and modern aesthetic across Apple’s platforms.\n\nModernized Design: Circular app icons, pill-shaped tab bars, and rounded menus with a glass-like appearance are set to refresh the interface, offering a sleek and unified look.\n\nCircular app icons, pill-shaped tab bars, and rounded menus with a glass-like appearance are set to refresh the interface, offering a sleek and unified look. Enhanced Lock Screen: Features such as translucent notifications, floating toggles, and customizable widgets will provide a more interactive and personalized user experience.\n\nThese visual changes not only modernize the interface but also reflect Apple’s broader vision of unifying design elements across its ecosystem. By aligning the aesthetics of iOS, iPadOS, and VisionOS, Apple aims to deliver a seamless experience for users navigating between devices.\n\nDevice Support: A Shift Toward Newer Hardware\n\nAs Apple introduces these advancements, some older devices may lose compatibility with iOS 19 and iPadOS 19. This shift highlights Apple’s strategy of optimizing software for newer hardware to ensure a seamless user experience.\n\niPhones: iOS 19 is rumored to drop support for the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, citing hardware limitations that could hinder the implementation of new features.\n\niOS 19 is rumored to drop support for the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, citing hardware limitations that could hinder the implementation of new features. iPads: iPadOS 19 may no longer support the 7th-generation iPad, while the 8th-generation model is expected to remain compatible.\n\nBy phasing out support for older models, Apple encourages users to adopt its latest devices, making sure that new features perform optimally without being constrained by outdated hardware.\n\nBalancing Innovation with Stability\n\nWhile the updates in iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 promise significant improvements, they also present challenges that Apple must address to maintain user trust and satisfaction.\n\nStability Concerns: Early builds of iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 may experience bugs and performance issues due to the extensive changes being implemented. Making sure a stable release will be critical to user adoption.\n\nEarly builds of iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 may experience bugs and performance issues due to the extensive changes being implemented. Making sure a stable release will be critical to user adoption. Underutilized Hardware: Critics argue that Apple has yet to fully use the power of its M-series chips in iPads, calling for more meaningful updates that go beyond visual enhancements and focus on unlocking the hardware’s full potential.\n\nAs Apple refines its operating systems, striking the right balance between innovation and stability will be essential to meeting user expectations and maintaining its reputation for quality.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe updates in iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 reflect Apple’s commitment to enhancing productivity and usability across its devices. From introducing Stage Manager on iPhones to implementing a redesigned interface and improving multitasking on iPads, Apple is pushing the boundaries of what its devices can achieve. However, the loss of support for older models and potential stability challenges highlight the complexities of innovation in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.\n\nThese advancements also reignite discussions about the potential unification of iPadOS and macOS. While Apple has resisted merging the two platforms, the growing overlap in functionality suggests a future where iPads could offer a full macOS experience. For now, iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 represent a significant step forward in Apple’s efforts to integrate hardware and software, shaping the future of mobile and tablet computing.\n\nExplore further guides and articles from our vast library that you may find relevant to your interests in Stage Manager.\n\nSource & Image Credit: SaranByte\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

Since his 20 January inauguration, Trump has passed an avalanche of executive orders (139 and counting) designed to dismantle traditional constraints on presidential power, and to advance his agenda: threatening law firms, universities and media owners into compliance; authorising Elon Musk's Doge to \"cripple\" the federal bureaucracy; firing the heads of 18 federal watchdogs; \"disappearing\" innocent migrant workers; and deporting foreign students who have written anti-Israel articles.\n\nIt's \"less a new administration\", said Andrew Sullivan in The Times, and more a \"vengeful monarchy\". The \"trappings of a republic remain\", but they are increasingly mere \"facades\". And for what, asked Andrew Rawnsley in The Observer. King Donald's assault on US universities has triggered a brain drain. His attack on the global order has been \"ruinous\" for the reputation of the US. He promised Americans he would bring down costs, but his trade war is set to fuel inflation and perhaps trigger a recession. \"Make America Great Again? Trumpism doesn't do what it says on the baseball cap.\"\n\nTell that to Trump's supporters, said Kimberley A. Strassel in The Wall Street Journal. \"Creative destruction\" is exactly what they wanted: they're fed up of the waste and \"indolence\" of Washington elites, and they voted for Trump to tear it all up. Besides, said Harry Cole in The Sun, who says his \"manic\" approach isn't working? \"Woke and trans sacred cows have been slaughtered\" by presidential decree; wasteful spending has \"gone up in smoke\". Countries are begging for new trade deals, and illegal border crossings, according to the administration, are down by 95%.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

It's like \"a supercar with 1,000 horsepower\", while his Democratic opponents coast around on \"mopeds\". If they want to win back power, they'll need to whip up some of that élan vital.\n\nThe resistance is already building, albeit not yet in Congress, said the FT. The bond markets have forced Trump to rein in his tariffs. The Supreme Court has taken a stand against illegal deportations. American voters, fretting about their wallets and retirement plans, are starting to abandon him too: Trump has one of the lowest approval ratings of any president after 100 days, at 40%.\n\nIf Democrats win next year's midterm elections, said Katie Stallard in The New Statesman, he could spend his last two years in office fighting off investigations and impeachments, ensuring his authoritarian agenda is derailed. But that's assuming, of course, the midterms actually happen. On the current trajectory, we may not get \"free and fair elections in 2026, let alone a peaceful transfer of power in 2028\"."}

The move is seen to be a key real-world use case for Hedera in the growing category of tokenized assets.\n\nGrowing optimism over the future of HBAR is emerging among social media analysts.

Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio.\n\nDogecoin’s price rebounded to $0.186 after declining from $0.185 to $0.15 earlier in the week. The rebound is evidence of buyers coming in on lower prices, a sign some market observers view as continued strength for the meme cryptocurrency.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCode Wars: Cardano Claims The Crown From Ethereum In Core Development 3 weeks ago\n\nAnalysts Monitor Long-Term Pattern Formation\n\nAs far as analyst Steph is Crypto is concerned, Dogecoin still tracks what they refer to as a “Legendary trend-line” that extends between three significant price lows over several years.\n\nThat support line started above $0.001 in early 2020, was again breached above $0.059 in 2024, and most recently broke below to find support around $0.14 in 2025. Each time the price struck this line, it has recoiled higher.\n\nThose who remain long on DOGE are “absolute legend,” Steph noted in their review, which gives a long-term price target of $10. That would be over 5,000% gain from present levels.\n\nDaily Charts Display More Conservative View\n\nOther analysts provide a less aggressive prediction using daily chart trends: Dogecoin tends to rebound from a rising trendline, making a sequence of higher lows. Their findings indicate these rebounds tend to follow false reversals that occur before significant breakout movements.\n\nPrevious Resistance Levels Become New Support\n\nTaking longer periods, another trend can be observed in the price movement of Dogecoin. As per analysis over three-day charts, earlier high values are seen to be acting as support levels subsequently.\n\nThis came to pass when DOGE broke above $0.097 resistance late in 2023, then retreated to test that same level as support early in 2024. The same thing occurred with the July 2024 high of $0.146, which became a support level in April 2025.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nFuture Price Targets Based On Historical Patterns\n\nThe February peak of $0.29 in 2025 is yet another reference point that preceded the recent price fall. While technical analysts had tested the $0.145 support point in April, they now look at $0.23 as the next level to watch as a resistance point.\n\nIn case these trends remain consistent, some experts are of the opinion that Dogecoin might hit $0.80, which would be more than its all-time high of $0.73.\n\nAlthough these predictions are largely based on technical chart patterns and not fundamental considerations, the predictability of Dogecoin’s price structure has drawn the interest of some cryptocurrency market observers.\n\nThe ascending trendline that has stood even during various market cycles is a primary indicator that most traders are monitoring to assess the strength of DOGE’s current position.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"}

Its alluring mixture of 90s nostalgia, supernatural mystery, and even horror elements makes it the perfect game to cozy up on the couch with, but sadly, it's not available on the Nintendo Switch.\n\nGiven that Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is an Unreal Engine 5 game, it probably wouldn't run particularly well on the eight-year-old console. In fact, my Life is Strange: Double Exposure review is proof that these kinds of games do not fare well on Nintendo's outdated hardware, but what about the Nintendo Switch 2?\n\nIn my recent Lost Records: Bloom & Rage interview, I asked Studio Executive Producer Luc Baghadoust whether the choice game would be headed to the Nintendo Switch 2. To my dismay, he told me that \"there are no current plans\" to bring Swann's story to the console, despite the fact that he thinks it looks \"awesome\". Notice that he said 'current', though, as this doesn't rule out a port later down the road.\n\nUnreal Engine 5 still poses a problem for even the best Steam Deck alternatives, let alone older handheld hardware, but it's not impossible to run on these devices. Games like Fortnite and Split Fiction are set to launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 despite being made in UE5, and Lost Records is Steam Deck Verified. I understand Don't Nod's hesitancy, though. The Life is Strange series has a rocky track record on the Switch, with Life is Strange 2 also performing poorly, and that game uses Unreal Engine 4.\n\nWe haven't even reached the Nintendo Switch 2 release date yet, so it's understandable if some developers want to wait and see what the console can really do before committing to porting their more graphics-intensive games. For now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage can join the long list of incredible Steam Deck games to try out next."}

While we already know that Star Wars: Outlaws is bringing Switch 2 players to a galaxy far, far away later this year, what about the studio's other massive franchises? Well, if you're keen for some Assassin's Creed Shadows action on the move, you could be in luck.\n\nIt's only a matter of time before the roster of new Switch games on Nintendo Switch 2 is full of triple-A games, but Ubisoft appears eager to get the ball rolling. In a recent social media post from Ubisoft Brazil, the account asks the following: \"Which Ubisoft game would you like to play on Nintendo Switch 2?\" Accompanying this is a comment from a Ubisoft administrator, who jokes that they want a Rayman Legends port.\n\nHowever, as fun as it'd be to revisit the beloved platforming series, the image with the post includes screenshots from Assassin's Creed Shadows and Mirage, Rainbow Six Siege, and the already confirmed Star Wars: Outlaws. Considering that Assassin's Creed Shadows is verified on Steam Deck, it's not a massive stretch to Naoe slicing and dicing foes on Nintendo's forthcoming handheld.\n\nI'm in favor of the Switch 2 seriously enhancing its FPS game library, as it desperately needs heavyweights like Call of Duty or refreshing additions to the genre like The Finals. The Division would also be an excellent shout, and who knows, maybe The Division 3 already has the Nintendo Switch 2 in mind as launch platform.\n\nI think it's safe to say Ubisoft is scouring its properties to find ideal fits for the console, and only increase the excitement of seeing what the Switch 2 is capable of.\n\nAfter all, Project 007, Cyberpunk 2077, and Elden Ring are all leading the portable gaming console's impressive list of triple-A ports. What Ubisoft games do you want to see on Nintendo Switch 2? You can let us know over on social media here.\n\nFor more of the latest mobile hardware and gaming news, whether you're diving into the best Steam Deck games or the best Switch games, follow us on Google News to stay in the loop."}

Five minutes later, the door opened and I was ushered back in. The office felt different now. Quiet and tense. Fetterman was still in the same chair but slumped into himself, like a deflated parade float. His shoes were now on, and he avoided looking at me. Finally, I broke the silence. “Anything to say about that?” I asked, hoping to pick up our conversation where we had left off.\n\n“There’s not anyone that you’re referencing who would be privy to my medical history,” he said.\n\n“Do you care to comment whether they are right or wrong?” I asked.\n\n“I’m just going to say that it’s disgruntled employees saying things that are either untrue or, so, that’s kind of the business that we are in,” he said.\n\nI asked him why these staffers might be disgruntled.\n\n“For whatever reason,” he said. “There’s a lot of people who just hide behind unnamed sources in articles.”\n\nI tried to move the conversation to Trump’s tariffs and other issues before leaving, but it was plainly clear that his mind was elsewhere. His voice was low. He barely bothered to look up. His sentences were clipped. “I feel like there’s been kind of a tone shift here,” I said, trying to catch his eye. “Can you tell me what you’re feeling? What you’re thinking?”\n\nFor the first time since I had returned to his office, he looked right at me. “No, everything’s great,” he said, deadpan. “Everything’s great. I don’t know what you’re referencing.”"}

(3rd May)", "fullContent": "Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer\n\nIt's all about The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy, baby. I've not been this consumed by a game in quite some time; I absolutely adore it. I've a feeling it's going to be quite a long one too, so it might keep me occupied until the Switch 2 launch, at this rate.\n\nThat's about it for me this week! I do want to get back to Pikmin 2 very soon, though.\n\nHave a good one, folks.\n\nKate Gray, Contributor\n\nI'm so into Clair Obscur. I'm not a JRPG gal at all, normally, but there's something about the combination of rhythmy turn-based combat à la Paper Mario and ridiculously thorough skill and strategy management à la Slay the Spire that just GETS me. Plus, the writing feels so fresh — it's goofy and self-referential, but not in the Marvel way where it's all \"well that just happened\". It also isn't afraid to be incredibly silly with how French it is — it's all baguettes and Eiffel Towers as far as the oeil can voir.\n\nThis year has been banger after banger so far, and now I'm just hoping Fantasy Life i doesn't break the chain (and my heart)...\n\nGavin Lane, Editor\n\nAfter setting up the equipment a couple of weekends ago, I've been on a Rock Band binge with the fam. There's still an intoxicating camaraderie to getting the band together and burning through familiar tunes. The Overdrive on my Gretsch doesn't work properly due to some faulty internal switches (can I be bothered to order new ones and solder them in?), but it's still a rockin' good time even when I'm not maxing my points potential. We started out with Lego, then we went to 3 via The Beatles, and we're currently noodling around with 2's excellent playlist.\n\nBeyond that, Oliver's recent Kablasta article had me digging the Labo cardboard out again and introducing it to the kids. The VR game is still a fun time and I'm glad I kept the blaster assembled. Maybe I'll dip into a few more minigames before consigning it all to the cupboard for another five years.\n\nPJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer\n\nBig plans for me this weekend include nabbing all of the stars on every course in Mario Kart 8's 200cc and mirror modes with my kids. I promised them we'd rinse the game before Switch 2 arrives, and I'm a man of my word.\n\nBeyond this, I'm planning to spend some serious time with Shotgun Cop Man, which looks and sounds right up my street. Can't wait!\n\nAlana Hagues, Deputy Editor\n\nI'm finally at the end of Xenoblade Chronicles X. And it only took 100 hours. Geez. I still have massive problems with the game overall, but I love it much more than I did the first time around. Hopefully the new chapter won't sour me on things...\n\nI'm also right at the end of Ender Magnolia, wrapping up everything before getting the \"true ending\", and I've loved every second of it. So, I've decided that before the Switch 2 lands, it's time to knock another 2025 indie out — Citizen Sleeper 2. I grabbed it on sale and I can't wait to see how it evolves the themes and mechanics of the first game.\n\nGonçalo Lopes, Contributor\n\nXenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition endgame is in sight! Chapter 12 awaits, all my skells are level 50 flying beasts, my avatar has mastered all the classes and is now a walking dps machine! More exciting than watching the end again, the extra Chapter 13 that will unlock immediately after what once was the Wii U version original ending that still haunts me to this very day. After that the game will become Monster Hunter for skells and over-the-top skells weapons. These weeks on Mira were a blast!\n\nThis year’s Wrestlemania felt more like “mehmania” so I am back on Gamecube’s WWE Day of Reckoning for my virtual in-ring shenanigans. I have discovered a fan made mod that includes a bunch of extra content from the previous games turning this already excellent entry into something truly insane. Throwing your opponent from a 100+ meter drop in a triple cage match followed up with a flying elbow drop? Every day occurrences now.\n\nI have been neglecting my physical Switch arrivals such as Pocket Bravery and I’ve been probably missing out on some eShop goodies like Blazing Trail. Better get on these fast because the Switch 2 is a mere month away...\n\nThat's what we have planned for the weekend, but what about you? Let us know in the following poll which games you're planning on booting up over the next couple of days."}

During an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier, the host asked Vance whether he believes Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could be the new face of the party.\n\n“President AOC, the stuff of nightmares, Bret, thank you. You’ve ruined my sleep for this evening,” Vance teased. “I don’t know.”\n\nBaier asked the vice president whether he thinks about the Democrat Party at all and who could be its new leader, following Trump’s defeat of former Vice President Kamala Harris and failed Democrat vice presidential nominee Tim Walz. (RELATED: Tucker Carlson Tells Megyn Kelly What Kind Of Democrat ‘Could Easily Get Elected’ in 2028)\n\n“I think to the extent the Democrats have a leader, Donald J. Trump is the leader of the Democratic Party,” Vance said. “Because they’re just against everything that he does. Who could possibly disagree with rebuilding American manufacturing and ensuring these steelworkers have higher wages and better jobs?”\n\nWATCH:\n\n\n\n“But any time Donald Trump does anything, they have this emotional response, they have to be against. Who could disagree with deporting millions of illegal aliens, many of whom are violent criminals? But they do, they have,” Vance added.\n\nIn March, a CNN/SSRS poll said the Democrat Party had dropped to a 29% approval rating— its lowest on record — marking a 20-point decline since January 2021. Among respondents, over 30% said they could not name a Democrat leader who “best reflects the core values” of the party. Of those who did, 10% named Ocasio-Cortez, 9% selected Harris, 8% chose Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and 6% wrote in House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\n“Whenever Donald J. Trump does something, they react negatively to it. They don’t have real leadership,” Vance said. “I think it’s why I’m not too concerned about 2028 because if I wake up in a fantasy world where the Democrats actually have constructive ideas about how to govern this country, that’ll actually be a good thing. But in the world that we actually live in, where they’re just anti-Trump about everything, the politics of 2028 will take care of themselves.”\n\nWith the 2026 midterms approaching and the 2028 general election on the horizon, speculation has swirled that Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are both eyeing their party’s presidential nomination.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Responding to concerns that Merchan had effectively “buried the case” by stalling post-conviction proceedings, Dershowitz pushed back during an appearance on “The Record with Greta Van Susteren.”\n\n“The case is going to be appealed. Trump has hired Sullivan and Cromwell to be his lawyers to appeal the case,” Dershowitz told Van Susteren when the host said the case will never go up to the Court of Appeals. “He will go first to the appellate division, then to the Court of Appeals, and, ultimately, the Supreme Court. The case will be appealed.”\n\nWhile saying that the courts might initially question jurisdiction over a conviction without a finalized sentence, Dershowitz said he does not expect that to stop the appeal from moving forward.\n\nWATCH:\n\n“He gave a sentence that was a non-sentence, but it’s enough to end the case and allow him to appeal, and I don’t think the appeal has yet been filed. I don’t think the briefs have yet been filed, but there is, I think, a schedule now. And there will be an appeal. Now, the Court may say, wait a minute, there was no sentence, so we have no jurisdiction,” Dershowitz added.\n\nDershowitz minced no words about the weakness of the Manhattan case.\n\n“I think they’re going to handle the appeal. I think they’re going to reverse the conviction, and if they don’t reverse the conviction, a higher court will. This is the weakest case in my 60 years of practicing law I have ever seen,” Dershowitz said.

Trump, who joined the sentencing hearing remotely, said the payment was a “legal expense” and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAfterward, the president announced plans to appeal the verdict in a Truth Social post.\n\n“The real Jury, the American People, have spoken, by Re-Electing me with an overwhelming MANDATE in one of the most consequential Elections in History. As the American People have seen, this ‘case’ had no crime, no damages, no proof, no facts, no Law, only a highly conflicted Judge, a star witness who is a disbarred, disgraced, serial perjurer, and criminal Election Interference,” Trump wrote.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Sam Cooke wrote the song to capture the social struggles of the era, delivering a powerful message of hope and perseverance. The song remains deeply relevant today, and Yang’s modern version brings it to life like never before.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Yang’s incredible performance went viral online, but the talented violinist and vocalist remains humble. “I am at a loss for words of the overwhelming reception y’all have given my performance here,” wrote Yang in an Instagram caption. “Thank you all for listening, for sharing, and thank you Sam Cooke for your profound song that is more powerful and relevant than ever in today’s time.”\n\nWhen he’s not playing as part of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, Yang is one of three members in the band, Time for Three. His bandmates Nicolas Kendall and Ranaan Meyer recently shared a video of his Sam Cooke cover on Facebook, showing their support and admiration for their fellow musician. “As band mates, we get to experience the deep heart and soul of our brotha Charles Yang every night onstage,” they write in the caption. “It’s nothing less than a true privilege, and it’s also kinda totally baddass to watch him do his thing, giving away so much love and changing people’s lives as he has done with ours.”\n\nCheck out Yang’s breathtaking performance below, and watch the entire Voices of a New World concert on the Symphony Live website.\n\nAt a recent Dallas Symphony Orchestra concert, violinist and vocalist Charles Yang delivered a powerful rendition of Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come.”\n\nWatch Yang's full performance.\n\nCharles Yang: Website | Facebook | Instagram | YouTube\n\nDallas Symphony Orchestra: Website | Facebook | Instagram\n\nSymphony Live: Website | Instagram | YouTube\n\nRelated Articles :\n\nTalented 9-Year-Old Violinist Joins Pianist for Impromptu Street Performance of ‘Carol of the Bells’\n\nSelf-Taught Violinist Becomes NYC Street Performer Wowing People With His Amazing Skills\n\nExpert Violinist Continues To Play Concerto Even With a Mid-Solo Broken String\n\nOne-Armed Violinist Performs Beautiful Solo With Custom-Built Prosthetic Bow Arm"}

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Gaming Realms (LON:GMR). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nWe check all companies for important risks. See what we found for Gaming Realms in our free report.\n\nHow Fast Is Gaming Realms Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nIn the last three years Gaming Realms' earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Gaming Realms' EPS shot up from UK£0.02 to UK£0.03; a result that's bound to keep shareholders happy. That's a commendable gain of 48%.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Gaming Realms is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.5 percentage points to 28%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\n\nAIM:GMR Earnings and Revenue History May 3rd 2025\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Gaming Realms\n\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Gaming Realms' forecast profits?\n\nAre Gaming Realms Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nIt's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. Gaming Realms followers will find comfort in knowing that insiders have a significant amount of capital that aligns their best interests with the wider shareholder group. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at UK£25m. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. That amounts to 20% of the company, demonstrating a degree of high-level alignment with shareholders."}

It seems that the market might have completely ignored the positive aspects of the company's fundamentals and decided to weigh-in more on the negative aspects. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. Particularly, we will be paying attention to BWYS Group Berhad's ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for BWYS Group Berhad is:\n\n3.5% = RM7.6m ÷ RM218m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every MYR1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated MYR0.03 in profit.\n\nSee our latest analysis for BWYS Group Berhad\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nBWYS Group Berhad's Earnings Growth And 3.5% ROE\n\nIt is quite clear that BWYS Group Berhad's ROE is rather low. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 5.6%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Therefore, BWYS Group Berhad's flat earnings over the past five years can possibly be explained by the low ROE amongst other factors.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that BWYS Group Berhad's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 12% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.\n\nKLSE:BWYS Past Earnings Growth May 3rd 2025\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future.

And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. Just think about the savvy investors who held Premier Foods plc (LON:PFD) shares for the last five years, while they gained 347%. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. We note the stock price is up 3.3% in the last seven days.\n\nAfter a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Premier Foods moved from a loss to profitability. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. Indeed, the Premier Foods share price has gained 86% in three years. In the same period, EPS is up 9.0% per year. Notably, the EPS growth has been slower than the annualised share price gain of 23% over three years. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nLSE:PFD Earnings Per Share Growth May 3rd 2025\n\nWe know that Premier Foods has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Premier Foods the TSR over the last 5 years was 366%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above.

But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. We regret to report that long term The Colonial Motor Company Limited (NZSE:CMO) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 35% in three years, versus a market decline of about 5.5%.\n\nIt's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that.\n\nOur free stock report includes 4 warning signs investors should be aware of before investing in Colonial Motor. Read for free now.\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring the three years that the share price fell, Colonial Motor's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 58% each year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 13% compound annual share price fall. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have previously priced some of the drop in. This positive sentiment is also reflected in the generous P/E ratio of 103.01.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nNZSE:CMO Earnings Per Share Growth May 3rd 2025\n\nIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This free interactive report on Colonial Motor's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Colonial Motor's TSR for the last 3 years was -20%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWhile the broader market gained around 5.5% in the last year, Colonial Motor shareholders lost 11% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Colonial Motor better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Colonial Motor (3 are a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here."}

Results were good overall, with revenues beating analyst predictions by 9.1% to hit €113m. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in at €0.04, some 7.7% above whatthe analysts had expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nXTRA:AIXA Earnings and Revenue Growth May 3rd 2025\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the 14 analysts covering AIXTRON provided consensus estimates of €542.4m revenue in 2025, which would reflect a chunky 14% decline over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to plunge 21% to €0.70 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of €540.0m and earnings per share (EPS) of €0.69 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\n\nView our latest analysis for AIXTRON\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at €14.80. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values AIXTRON at €22.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at €9.80. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.\n\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 18% by the end of 2025. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 21% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 8.0% per year. It's pretty clear that AIXTRON's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry."}

The yield represents both possible income and capital appreciation from Strategy’s investments in Bitcoin. With prices of Bitcoin still on the rise, the firm continues to make strategic buys of the digital currency.\n\nAccording to reports, Strategy has changed its business tactics in the last five years.

The company’s move is to invest half the funds ($42 billion) in fixed income and the remaining half ($42 billion) in fixed equity.\n\nThis significant capital outlay indicates Strategy still has faith in the long-term worth of Bitcoin. The company considers Bitcoin a key component to its business model and a fundamental asset for its treasury holdings.\n\nThe scale of this investment is a staggering increase on past expenditure. If implemented, it would leave Strategy an even more prominent corporate owner of Bitcoin than it is currently.\n\nPerformance Targets Leap From 15% To 25%\n\nStrategy has increased its Bitcoin performance targets for the next year. The firm has been targeting a 15% return on its Bitcoin holdings but now anticipates 25%.\n\nConcurrently, the company raised its target for dollar gains from Bitcoin in 2025.

The order also ordered CPB to make sure no funding for local public radio and TV stations goes to purchasing content from NPR or PBS, which could effectively kill off public TV and radio if the order survives court challenges.\n\nOn a separate track, Trump’s (acting) US Attorney for the DC District, Ed Martin, last week sent a nastygram to Wikipedia accusing it of spreading “propaganda” and probably violating its tax-exempt status because it’s so mean and unfair to conservatives.\n\nBoth moves are exactly the kinds of suppression of press freedom you’d expect under an authoritarian regime, which we suppose might be the most obvious thing we’ve written all week. If there’s one thing the MAGA Right can’t stand, it’s information that contradicts Trump. But the rightwing obsession with going after public media and Wikipedia isn’t solely about wanting to consolidate control over information. Like so many Trumpian culture-war “policies,” it’s driven by a deep well of resentment and revenge, a desire to get even with the snooty elites who must be punished for liking things that Real Americans don’t.\n\nDo Righties Even Know We Call NPR ‘Nice Polite Republicans’?\n\nThe pretext for going after public media is that NPR and PBS are supposedly “biased” in their news coverage, but the rage is aimed every bit as much at the latte-sipping EV drivers (even worse if it’s a Volvo EV!) whose car radios seldom leave the left side of the FM dial. (Or wouldn’t, if car radios still had dials.) PBS and NPR appeal to the wrong kind of Americans, if you can call them Americans at all, so they must be eliminated.\n\nWhoever wrote Trump’s EO — Stephen Miller or an AI trained on his collected cranial oozings — said that public broadcasting had long ago outlived its usefulness, so it’s now time to put it out on an ice floe for the good of everyone:\n\nUnlike in 1967, when the CPB was established, today the media landscape is filled with abundant, diverse, and innovative news options. Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.\n\nIn a lovely bit of doublethink, the order explains that if we do have federally funded broadcasting, it must be both 100 percent neutral and must dance to any tune the executive branch chooses.\n\nAt the very least, Americans have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage. No media outlet has a constitutional right to taxpayer subsidies, and the Government is entitled to determine which categories of activities to subsidize.\n\nWhy, no, there’s not really any attempt to reconcile all those contradictory claims. Whatever PBS and NPR air is bad and wrong, so they must be extirpated. That said, an accompanying “fact sheet” alleges that public TV and radio are basically in cahoots with Democrats, because didn’t that one former NPR editor say so?\n\nThe document — quite a specimen of propaganda in its own right — repeats a load of supposedly “biased” coverage from NPR and PBS, including — as evidence of the now-banned discussion of LGBTQ existence — an 11-minute NPR podcast feature on “queer animals” which pointed out the completely true fact that “banana slugs are hermaphrodites,” which we are sorry, they just plain are, even if they move too slowly to take part in Pride parades. Also, some PBS programs have depicted transgender people as real human beings, which is very unfair to the Right.\n\nThe “fact sheet” also recapitulates the rightwing hissy over that time Sesame Street and CNN did a town hall about racism, and now that’s illegal too, you know. Or as the unbiased fact sheet put it very objectively, the town hall “aimed presenting children (sic) with a one-sided narrative to ‘address racism’ amid the Black Lives Matter riots.”\n\nYes, that’s from the White House complaint about public broadcasting’s bias.\n\nIn the face of constant rightwing political attacks over the last few decades, both NPR and PBS have taken steps to insulate themselves from defunding threats by increasingly relying on donations from their audiences, as well as from private foundations and corporate underwriters. NPR itself gets less than one percent of its funding comes from taxpayers.\n\nBut that’s just the funding for the networks. Local public TV and radio stations that carry programming from NPR, PBS, and other sources have to pay for it, and they are far more dependent on funding from CPB, especially in smaller markets where stations don’t have the listener base of those in large cities. As a result, if the order prohibiting local stations from using CBP funds to carry PBS and NPR content holds up in court — thankfully, a very big if — it could result in hundreds of smaller public stations going silent, taking away the only local news sources their communities still have.\n\nFortunately, the executive order is illegal as fuck, yet another attempt by Trump to withhold funds that Congress has already allocated. In fact, to help shield public broadcasting from political threats, CPB is officially a private nonprofit, though it’s funded by taxpayers. Its budget is funded two years in advance to further protect it against retaliation, but Trump hopes to claw back $1 billion of its current allocation to fund tax cuts for billionaires.\n\nEd Martin’s Dumb War On Wikipedia\n\nAnd then there’s the dumb accusations against Wikipedia from Ed Martin, Trump’s choice as US Attorney for the DC District. The good news is that there may not be enough Republican votes in the Senate to confirm him. But even in his acting role, he’s acting like he’s some kind of private eye, threatening Wikimedia, the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia, with loss of its nonprofit status, for doing bad things.\n\nIn a letter last week, Martin accused Wikipedia of “allowing foreign actors to manipulate information and spread propaganda to the American public,” because anyone can post edits to the open-source encyclopedia, even non-USA persons, which is how it’s designed. The way the place works is that if somebody posts crap information to the site, other editors can remove the crap and replace it with more reliable information from reputable sources.\n\nMartin whined that this was really unfair, claiming that\n\n“Wikipedia is permitting information manipulation on its platform, including the rewriting of key, historical events and biographical information of current and previous American leaders, as well as other matters implicating the national security and the interests of the United States.\n\nHe alleged that allowing just anyone to edit articles, anonymously, amounts to “masking propaganda that influences public opinion” which is somehow a violation of Wikimedia’s tax-exempt “educational” status, so maybe the Justice Department will just have to step in and do something!\n\nThis is where we point out that the DOJ doesn’t normally determine whether a nonprofit actually qualifies to be a nonprofit, since that’s the IRS’s job. But Martin has a culture war to fight on behalf of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, so why shouldn’t he do some prosecutin’ outside his remit?\n\nMartin also alleged that Wikimedia’s board of directors “is composed primarily of foreign nationals, subverting the interests of American taxpayers,” darkly hinting that that too was illegal somehow. Worse, he claimed that “information received by my Office demonstrates that Wikipedia’s informational management policies benefit foreign powers.”\n\nIt’s a pretty creepy attempt to intimidate a nonprofit online encyclopedia, if you ask us. But again, rightwing weirdos have been complaining about Wikipedia for decades, saying that it’s terribly unfair to rightwing blog outlets just because they lie a lot. Elon Musk has taken to calling the place “Wokipedia,” and especially dislikes that articles about him and his companies are insufficiently flattering.\n\nAlso, Musk offered Wikipedia a billion dollars to change its name, to “Dickipedia,” proving that he is the wittiest man on the Right and lefties are nervous. For some reason it chose not to.

Can New T-90s Stop the Bleeding?", "fullContent": "Even the newest iterations of the T-90 have struggled against Ukraine’s stockpile of Western-delivered anti-tank weaponry.\n\nWhen it comes to Russia’s arsenal losses, its main battle tank (MBT) platforms have taken a real beating. Since the invasion commenced back in early 2022, Moscow has deployed all of its armored vehicle assets to the frontlines. From World War II-era relics and Soviet-era tanks to more modern successors, Russian officials have really pulled from storage in order to maintain an MBT fleet for Moscow’s offensive efforts. Although exact figures and specs regarding Russia’s MBT losses are unknown as the war is active and details are difficult to confirm, open-source intelligence trackers estimate that Moscow has likely lost around 3,000 of its armored vehicles in the last year alone.\n\nEarlier this year, Russia’s Uralvagonzabod delivered new batches of upgraded T-90M tanks to the Russian army to help replenish some of these losses. While maintaining a larger MBT fleet will be important for the Kremlin’s sustained offensive efforts, the T-90 does not have the best performance record.\n\nIntroducing the T-90\n\nThe T-90 is a third-generation MBT born out of a Soviet-era program tasked with creating the successor for the T-72. While work surrounding the T-90 began under the USSR, the tank itself did not enter the production pipeline until the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. When the T-90 reached operational capacity with the Russian army, it featured several improved capabilities that made it superior to earlier variants. From composite armor materials and reactive armor to smoke grenades and a 125mm smoothbore main gun, the T-90 is well equipped.\n\nThe newest T-90 iteration can fire the 9M119 Refleks anti-tank guided missile system, which is “intended to engage tanks fitted with explosive reactive armor (ERA), as well as low-flying air targets, such as helicopters, at a range of up to 5km,” according to Army Technology. While this Russian platform appears formidable on paper, when combat-tested, the tank platform simply does not meet expectations. Even the newest iterations of the T-90 have struggled against Ukraine’s stockpile of Western-delivered anti-tank weaponry.\n\nBack in 2023, Russia’s state-run news outlet TASS reported that President Vladimir Putin boasted about the T-90’s capabilities. According to TASS, Putin claimed that “now we (the Kremlin) can say that the T-90 is the best tank in the world—once it’s in position, that’s it.” However, open-source intelligence tracker Oryx has put forth numbers that suggest otherwise. Oryx’s detailed analysis of Russian military losses indicates that its forces have lost more than 3,200 tanks. Over the last few years, footage depicting the destruction of T-90 MBTs has circulated widely on social media. Just one of these instances was captured on Telegram. In the post, several Ukrainian-launched attack unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within Kyiv’s 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade appear to take out a T-90. As seen in the footage, these drones hit the top of the tank’s turret and damaged part of its guidance system. While the video has yet to be verified, the T-90 MBT is undoubtedly vulnerable to drone attacks.\n\nAbout the Author: Maya Carlin\n\nMaya Carlin, National Security Writer with The National Interest, is an analyst with the Center for Security Policy and a former Anna Sobol Levy Fellow at IDC Herzliya in Israel.
