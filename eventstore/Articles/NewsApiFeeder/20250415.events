Xantana/Getty Images\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nI moved from the US to France with my French partner, two suitcases, and my American optimism.\n\nHe had thrived as an international student in the US, so I assumed I'd adapt just as easily as a young professional in Paris.\n\nHowever, after we got married, I struggled to adjust — and I coped by comparing my new life to my old one.\n\nIt took me a while to absorb the best piece of advice I received as an expat\n\nI was lucky to find an international friend group shortly after my move.\n\nOne day, while venting to one of them about how I missed American salaries, holidays, and even my family dentist, she stopped me and simply said, \"You can't compare.\"\n\nAt the time, I knew she was right, but didn't want to hear it. However, as the years passed, I realized it was the best advice about moving abroad I'd ever received.\n\nComparison is natural — after all, how often do we see articles ranking countries against each other? Although this can be useful, constantly measuring my old life, comfort level, and norms against my new ones only made me blind to everything France had given me.\n\nAdjusting to a new place can take years — and that's OK\n\nIt's been fun getting to explore Italy and other parts of Europe while based in France. Grace Brennan\n\nI've heard people say it takes two years to feel at home in a new country. For me, it took four (plus a gap year in London and a move to the South of France, where my husband is from).\n\nThe turning point came when I finally stopped comparing my life to what could've been.\n\nYes, I make less money here, and seeing my friends back home land impressive salaries can make me question my path. Since I left, I've only been home once for Thanksgiving, and celebrating away from family and missing weddings and funerals never gets easier.\n\nPlus, I still miss little things, like SoulCycle and Trader Joe's, more often than I'd like to admit. However, I've got so much to appreciate about my new life in France.\n\nI work less, stress less, and have had the space to reassess my career. I became self-employed, started lecturing in an English program at a French university at 25, and built a new life centered on my passions for writing, music, and nonprofit work.\n\nI've made new friends from all over the world who have become like family. I also appreciate the support, patience, and grace of my community back home more than ever. Plus, I've had the joy of hosting many of them here, sharing our home and life in ways I never could have if I'd stayed in the US.\n\nMost importantly, I've developed a deep gratitude for how my husband's country has shaped him and welcomed me.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nThese days, I focus on having gratitude for all my new country has given me\n\nWhile I plan my future in France, I remain incredibly grateful for where I grew up. The US will always be a part of me, and I wouldn't trade my American upbringing or university experience for anything.\n\nI still have bittersweet moments, like realizing my future kids' childhood won't look anything like mine. However, now, those feelings are balanced by the excitement of getting to see them experience their own culture in one of the most beautiful countries.\n\nFor anyone who has recently moved abroad or is considering it, all I can say is this: The best thing I ever did was stop comparing and start appreciating both where I'm at and where I'm from."}

As a key source of potassium, potash is essential to plant growth, boosting crop yields, and preventing soil depletion—making it irreplaceable in modern industrial farming and vital to global food security. Without it, agricultural output would plummet, driving up food prices and exacerbating shortages. Yet with few domestic sources, the U.S. imports over 80% of its supply from Canada—making the mineral a potential economic weapon for Canada. Recognizing this vulnerability, Ontario Premier Doug Ford has floated the idea of cutting off U.S. exports entirely in response to the Trump administration’s promise of escalating tariffs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nEven President Donald Trump has belatedly recognized the importance of Canadian potash. In Feb., he lowered his initial 25% tariff to 10%. Yet Trump's willingness to gamble with this critical resource stands in stark contrast to past leaders, who went to great lengths to secure these supplies. Potash, technically a term for a variety of potassium-rich minerals, became essential in the 19th century as industrialization drove the need for chemical fertilizers. With soils depleted by intensive farming, and populations growing rapidly in urban centers, agriculture could no longer rely solely on traditional methods for accessing potassium, such as crop rotation and wood ash. Potassium, along with nitrogen and phosphorus, became one of the three key nutrients in modern fertilizer, and demand for it soared. Germany, with vast deposits in places like Stassfurt, quickly became the dominant global supplier of potash. Long a pioneer in chemical fertilizer, Germany backed its industry with aggressive state intervention. In the early 20th century, the government forced all domestic producers into a centralized, state-supervised cartel. This allowed Germany to regulate output, fix prices, and undercut international competitors—consolidating near-total control over the global potash market and leaving other nations dangerously dependent.\n\nRead More: How Trump Revived Canada's Liberals The risks of this monopoly became clear during World War I, when Germany cut off exports to weaken the Allies. It worked. The price of potash soared fifteenfold. As countries scrambled by tapping into fertilizer reserves and using alternatives such as sea kelp, the embargo put a serious strain on global food supplies. Potash also was an essential ingredient in gunpowder, adding to the strain of the embargo. The wartime potash shortage left an indelible mark on other European nations, which emerged from the conflict determined to secure their own supplies. For France, the answer lay in Alsace—a region it had previously controlled and the location of a major potash mine once integrated into the German cartel. When Alsace was returned to French control under the Treaty of Versailles, French authorities quickly seized the mine and took over operations, transforming it into a reliable domestic source and a safeguard against future foreign dependence.\n\nBritain, however, had no such ready solution. Lacking domestic reserves, its leaders looked farther afield—to the Dead Sea, whose mineral-rich salts contained one of the world’s most promising untapped sources of potash. The region around the Dead Sea (part of the Ottoman Empire prior to WWI) held enormous economic appeal for imperial powers; a 1929 New York Times article estimated the Dead Sea’s salts to be worth a staggering $100 to $200 billion—in 1925 dollars. One member of the UK's House of Lords, Viscount Templeton even described the Dead Sea, Haifa Bay, and the Jordan Valley as a “unique industrial trilogy,” arguing that their value made “permanent British control” essential. The economic promise of Dead Sea potash played a key role in Britain’s insistence on governing Palestine after World War I. But extracting the mineral posed a challenge. Elsewhere, potash was mined from rock, while its viability as a large-scale waterborne extract remained uncertain. Rather than take on the financial risk directly, Britain sought private investors, offering a monopoly concession to exploit the Dead Sea’s resources—a move that would allow private capital to absorb the risk while the empire reaped the benefits.\n\nThe strongest bid for the Dead Sea potash concession came from Moshe Novomesky, a Siberian engineer and the only applicant with a proven extraction method. Backed by deep-pocketed New York investors from the Palestine Economic Corporation, Novomesky had already built a small experimental plant that successfully demonstrated a low-cost process for extraction that relied on solar evaporation of Dead Sea waters. His results convinced British officials in Palestine that he was the best choice to secure this critical resource. Yet Novomesky’s bid also posed a problem: he was Jewish and an active Zionist. British officials fearedhis loyalties lay more with the Zionist movement than the Empire—a concern that blended legitimate strategic considerations with antisemitic suspicions of Jewish disloyalty. More pressing, they worried that granting such a lucrative concession to a Zionist would inflame Arab opposition.\n\nTo ease British concerns, Novomesky partnered with several respected British citizens—Major Thomas Gregorie Tulloch, and Victor Bulwer-Lytton, the second Earl of Lytton—and agreed to various export and production guarantees. While this reassured London of his loyalty, it did little to address the second problem. Still, the value of an independent potash supply outweighed the risks. Despite significant parliamentary pushback, Britain awarded Novomesky the concession, convinced he was the best option to develop the resource. Read More: Why Trump’s Tariffs Could Raise Grocery Prices That decision proved economically sound for the British. Novomesky’s company, Palestine Potash Limited, exceeded its production quotas, vindicating British faith in his methods. But fears of unrest were well-founded. As historian Jacob Norris has shown, Palestinian Arabs viewed the concession as yet another example of British favoritism toward Zionists and a plundering of their country's resources, fueling nationalist anger and Palestinian unrest. Britain even faced the threat of embarrassing potential legal challenges to the concession in The Hague.\n\nYet, despite the backlash, the government held firm and Britain’s gamble paid off when World War II broke out. As Germany once again cut off potash exports, Britain invoked an emergency clause in Novomesky’s concession, diverting nearly all Dead Sea production to the Empire. What had once been a geopolitical risk—investing in a Zionist-led extraction enterprise—became a strategic advantage, ensuring Britain’s uninterrupted supply of a critical wartime resource. While the conflict devastated numerous supply lines worldwide, Britain had secured its potash lifeline. The lesson? The British Empire understood that securing a reliable supply of potash was essential to its survival. So essential that it subordinated other national goals to ensure access to the mineral—a kind of Britain First policy. While Britain’s rule in Palestine is rarely judged a success, its decision to prioritize potash helped Britain safeguarded its supply.\n\nIn contrast, Trump appears willing to gamble with the U.S. supply of potash, even as major alternative producers—Russia, Belarus, and China—pose geopolitical challenges. Meanwhile, Israel, a U.S. ally, supplies only 5% of the global market, and its reserves, still harvested through Novomesky’s solar evaporation method, are literally drying up.\n\nJacob Beckert is a doctoral candidate at the University of Washington, Seattle, where he researches American investment in Mandatory Palestine and its ties to capitalism and conflict in the region.\n\nMade by History takes readers beyond the headlines with articles written and edited by professional historians.

Many Americans go through the motions of paying their taxes as a dreaded but necessary ritual. This eye-rolling, annual chore is annoying, obviously, but also tied to the functioning of government. Recently, anti-tax sentiment has increased with the rise of MAGA Republicans and a second Trump Presidency. Project 2025 calls for eliminating income taxes altogether and drastically slashing taxes for corporations and the wealthiest Americans. President Donald Trump has even suggested abolishing the IRS and replacing income taxes with tariffs. In the meantime, many of the wealthiest Americans have embraced tax evasion. Few, it seems, regard tax-paying as particularly profound or meaningful. Yet, historically, American attitudes toward taxes reveal a great deal about the quality of life in America, institutional trust, and social cohesion in general. Ironically, the 1950s era that MAGA Americans regard nostalgically was the height of fiscal patriotism—a time when the wealthiest Americans were willing to pay higher taxes for the benefit of all.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBefore World War II, less than 1% of Americans paid an income tax of only 1% of net income, which had been established by the Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1913. But after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Congress passed a new Revenue Act in 1942 to fund the U.S. war effort. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt knew from experience that the rich would resist any new taxes to fund the war. He had been sparring with the rich since the 1930s when they had tried to sabotage his New Deal. But the shock of Pearl Harbor prompted even the top two business lobby groups, the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce, to support FDR’s plans for increased taxation. Paying taxes was regarded as a patriotic duty. “Paying taxes to beat the Axis!” became a rallying cry in the midst of America’s efforts to defeat fascism. In 1942, Walt Disney himself was tapped by the U.S. government to create a motivational video educating Americans about the importance of paying taxes. In 1943, a second video was created showing Donald Duck’s taxes funding the boys fighting fascism abroad while a narrator’s booming voice declared, “Every dollar you sock away for taxes is another dollar to sock the Axis!” These videos were wildly successful, cementing the idea that paying higher taxes, especially for the wealthy, was a civic responsibility.\n\nRead More: How Mass Layoffs at the IRS Will Affect Tax Season The top marginal tax rate soared as high as 94% in 1944 on incomes over $3.6 million (in inflation-adjusted dollars) and stayed at 90% for the next two decades. The corporate tax rate peaked at 53% during the war and stayed there for even longer, not falling under 40% until the 1980s. The effects of what FDR called an “equity-in-sacrifice” economy were spectacular. Higher taxes on top really did mean a better quality of life at the bottom. Many wartime taxes remained in place after the war ended, funding infrastructure, education, and housing—all of which laid the foundation for an expanding middle class. During this time, labor unions thrived. And the G.I. Bill made a college education and home ownership accessible for millions of (mostly white) men, due to race-based admissions quotas and discriminatory lending practices. Although the gains of the post-World War II economy were not evenly shared across racial lines, this period helped lay the groundwork for significant social and economic advancements, including the rise of a Black middle class and the strengthening of the Civil Rights Movement, which gained momentum in part due to the economic and social changes of the postwar era.\n\nBut FDR and Vice President Henry Wallace were also after something more. They wanted Americans to learn from the horrors of Nazi Germany. They knew that demagogues like Adolf Hitler were more likely to come to power in plutocratic societies where wealth was concentrated and untaxed. Taxing away excess wealth was not just about funding a war but also about putting a check on fascism, even at home. FDR’s vision of an “equity-in-sacrifice” economy seemed to have won the day. And it did, for a while. Amid this wave of patriotic tax compliance, one woman planted the seeds for a radically different vision. Businesswoman Vivien Kellems foreshadowed an opposing view of taxation that, although labeled as treasonous at the time, would later become dominant. Kellems argued that withholding taxes was unconstitutional because it represented “deprivation of property without due process of law” and “involuntary servitude.” Kellems attracted media attention, mostly negative: she was widely labeled a “traitor” in the context of World War II fiscal patriotism. Public reaction to her “crackpot” ideas reflects just how completely patriotism and taxation had fused during the war.\n\nAs the war receded, wealthier Americans began falling into lockstep with Kellems whose arguments were eventually no longer considered treasonous. In the 1950s through 1970s, the top marginal tax rates remained quite high. Even though President John F. Kennedy finally brought taxes down in the early 1960s from their wartime levels, the top marginal tax rate was still at a whopping 70%, down from 91%. And JFK was hardly an anti-tax conservative. Influenced by Keynesian economics, JFK wanted to pump more of consumers’ money into the economy (noting that the high-tax wartime economy should not be kept in place forever) while also increasing spending on social programs including unemployment benefits, Social Security, and highway construction. The high marginal tax rates throughout this period prompted wealthier Americans to take advantage of loopholes such as buying rental properties and creating collapsible corporations, among others. Over time, these tax evaders began reframing their tax resistance as a form of patriotism, a reversal of FDR’s fiscal patriotism.\n\nRead More: Ronald Reagan's Policies Continue to Exacerbate the Racial Wealth Gap By the time of the Reagan Revolution in the 1980s, the stage was set for slashing the corporate tax rate from 73% to 28%–the lowest it had been since 1925. The top marginal tax rate was also slashed from 70% to 33% by 1989. But the wealthiest Americans were not satisfied with these cuts. Today, tax evasion is so common that the Treasury Department estimates the top 1% of wealthy Americans annually evade $163 billion in owed taxes. Income and wealth inequality, which had steadily declined from the 1940s through the 1970s, have been rising ever since. Though Trump has gone back and forth on his tariff promises, it must be stated that his proposal to replace income taxes with tariffs would further unravel the concept of fiscal patriotism. The period of American history that marks the peak of tariffs as a source of federal revenues was from the 1870s through the early 20th century—also known as the Gilded Age, an era of extreme income and wealth inequality. Tariffs, essentially a consumption tax that raises the price of imported goods, worsen inequality because lower-income households are hit the hardest by price increases. In other words, tariffs are a regressive tax—the polar opposite of FDR’s postwar economy. Historically, there are no examples of an economy based only on tariffs that successfully fostered a prosperous, equitable society.\n\nAs FDR and Wallace warned, income and wealth inequality soar in societies that refuse to tax away large concentrations of wealth. The foundations of the middle class begin to crack and split open. Public services and infrastructure can no longer be funded, leading to privatization. And the excess purchasing power caused by excess (untaxed) wealth distorts markets, leading to inflated prices for ordinary people. Trust in institutions, quality of life, and social cohesion all decline, leading to an increased risk of demagoguery. Today, we are grappling with the resurgence of plutocracy, where the richest few wield disproportionate power, and the collective good is increasingly sidelined. As we face another Tax Day, we would do well to remember the type of broad-based prosperity that progressive taxation once created in America. While tax loopholes for the wealthy and the rollback of progressive taxation have made Tax Day almost universally reviled, we should not lose sight of what a just tax system can do for our society.\n\nDr. Betsy Wood is an American historian and author of Upon the Altar of Work: Child Labor & the Rise of a New American Sectionalism.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence\r\n.\r\nA senior Intel execu… [+5620 chars]", "title": "Intel wants laptops to become as modular as desktop PCs", "fullContent": "A senior Intel executive said Tuesday that Intel has begun building more modularity into its laptop designs, allowing PC builders additional flexibility and consumers the ability to potentially replace or upgrade certain parts of the laptop.\n\nIntel executive Gokul Subramaniam, vice president of Intel’s Client Computing Group and president of Intel India, said that the last two or three generations of Intel’s designs have featured increased modularity inside the laptop, to assist companies such as Asus or Acer with designing multiple versions of a laptop without extensive re-engineering.\n\nThe concept in question is what’s known as modular design. Desktop PCs were basically founded upon this principle, allowing PC makers and consumers alike to slide out hard drives and optical drives, or unscrew and replace SSDs in M.2 slots in today’s PCs. Laptops, though, have traditionally been considered sealed boxes, and just being able to access the internals is a prized feature that not every laptop offers.\n\nThe message? Modularity’s time is now. PC makers can easily manufacture multiple versions of a product, and swap out a failing part quickly and relatively cheaply. Consumers, hopefully, will have some say in which peripherals and capabilities will appear on their PCs as well.\n\nFramework’s laptops have modular ports that can be pulled out and replaced. Intel seems to think other vendors may follow suit, but will it happen? IDG / Chris Hoffman\n\nOne company, Framework, has viewed this as a business opportunity. Framework Laptops, and now its Framework Desktop, feature modular components that can be easily replaced, such as swapping out a USB-C port for a legacy USB-A connector. Subramaniam used a similar example in discussing modularity in a brief talk with reporters.\n\nIntel is working to make PCs more modular at the system, board, and component level, Subramaniam said. (Two of the three will benefit laptop makers directly.) At the system level, Intel is co-designing entire boards with its partners, so as to enable a single design for a 16-inch, dual-fan laptop, as well as a second design for a 14-inch, single-fan design. Shipping the larger laptop or the smaller laptop would enable simply inserting the board into the laptop chassis.\n\nIntel is working with PC makers to allow their designs to become more modular, from a manufacturing standpoint. Intel\n\nIntel is also trying to split up the laptop motherboards, sub-dviding them into two or three or even multiple PCBs, all connected by cables or connectors. Again, the idea is that customers like ordering from a menu of parts, with specific capabilities; in response, PC makers could simply connect individual cards or small daughterboards with wireless modules. Subramaniam identified M.2 modules as one key piece of the modular approach, since it was an easy way for a PC maker or consumer to swap out cards and capabilities alike.\n\nFinally, there is modularity at the user level, such as a user-replaceable SSD. Some vendors allow this, and access to the insides of a laptop has been one of the sticking points of the right-to-repair movement. But one of the neatest features of Framework has just been the ability to swap out a cheap peripheral port.\n\n“One of the key things is the requirements of the end user is constantly changing,” Subramaniam said. “The interests are varying. You have a variety of user needs.”\n\nSome people may be happy with the laptop’s default camera, Subramaniam said. But others would want to swap out the camera for something better, without needing to buy a superior webcam.\n\nIf there was any drawback to Intel’s new approach, it’s that it seems focused on the PC vendor, not the consumer. Intel’s Subramaniam did not propose a forthcoming reference design with swappable I/O modules, for example. And there’s nothing like the Open Compute Project — an open-source design for making a reference server that’s a decade old.\n\nBasically, Intel’s stance right now is that modular computing is a good thing, and that it’s feeling its way through with customers in order to simplify the process of developing more standardized, upgradable laptops. But Subramaniam did not indicate that Intel or the PC industry is working toward a world where you’ll be able to open up a laptop and swap out a motherboard…you know, like Framework does. There’s no sign that a Microsoft Surface or an Acer Swift will do the same.\n\nBasically, this diagram is showing what Framework is doing — allowing customers to swap out ports. Intel\n\nModular PC designs, of course, offer all sorts of intriguing possibilities: easily swapping out or upgrading I/O, or even replacing an entire motherboard or CPU. Would a modular laptop need to be thicker to accomodate the flexibility? Would PC makers prefer the benefits of modularity while accepting the reality that they’re simply assembling PCs, rather than engineering them? All good questions, and ones we’ll have to leave for the future.\n\nSo while Intel says it loves modularity, we’ll have to see if it — and the rest of the PC industry — follows through."}

To score this amazing price, make sure you clip the on-page coupon to get 45% off, then tack on an additional 7% off with promo code 6QLYR8CY at checkout.\n\nWith a high capacity of 20,000mAh, the Baseus Blade has enough juice to fully recharge most laptops from dead to full in one go, while remaining within the TSA’s maximum limit for portable chargers. And with 100W of charging power, you’ll be charged and ready to go within minutes rather than hours.\n\nThe Baseus Blade gets its name from its physical design and shape: wide and flat, unlike other power banks that are more chunky and blocky. Measuring just 0.7 inches thick and weighing a smidge over 1 pound, it’s the perfect companion because it can slip into any bag right next to your laptop and you won’t notice the extra weight at all. (If you’d prefer a more traditionally shaped power bank that fits in your palm, the 45W Baseus Picogo is on sale for $18 with promo code.)\n\nOf course, you can use the Baseus Blade with more than just your laptop, including your phone, tablet, handheld gaming console, earbuds, and so on. It has two USB-C and two USB-A ports, allowing you to recharge up to four devices simultaneously (with the 100W of charging power being split up being them when multiple ports are being used). The small digital display lets you know exactly how much power you still have remaining and how long it’ll take to reach full charge on your device(s).\n\nI have the second Baseus Blade 2 and I absolutely love how thin and light it is, but it has less power so charging takes longer. With the original Blade on sale for just $48, this is a deal you don’t want to miss. Don’t forget to clip the coupon and use code 6QLYR8CY at checkout!\n\nSave 52% on this fast-charging 20K laptop power bank"}

Right now, eBay is selling the HP EliteBook 845 G8—already a budget design—for just $325. That gets you 16GB of RAM, a Ryzen 5 processor, 512GB of storage, and a 14-inch screen. It’s just about impossible to beat for the price.\n\nThere’s one fly in this ointment, though. The laptop is refurbished and it’s being sold by a third-party seller on eBay. They’re including a two-year Allstate warranty, which is nice, but such warranties can sometimes be a bit of a hassle to actually use when needed.\n\nThat foible aside, I really can’t overstate how good of a deal this is if you’re looking for a super-cheap laptop that can handle Windows 11 smoothly. Both the Ryzen 5 processor and the DDR4 RAM are on the older side, but it should still be more than enough to run modern browsers without a hitch, including streaming high-res video and a little light gaming (thanks to AMD’s excellent integrated graphics).\n\nAnd the laptop isn’t hurting for ports, with two USB-C ports (which can technically charge the laptop but apparently it’s a bit iffy), two USB-A ports, and full-sized HDMI. The screen is not touch-enabled, but it is a 1080p IPS panel. That’s good enough for me.\n\nThis isn’t showing as some kind of special promotion or timed sale on eBay, so this HP laptop deal might last a while. That said, super-deep discounts on inexpensive tech tend to make them sell quickly. If you’ve been waiting for an affordable, decently powerful Windows laptop below the $500 mark, you might want to snag this one quickly.\n\nSee our roundup of the best laptops for other suggestions.\n\nThis HP laptop with solid specs is a fantastic deal for $325"}

This doesn't affect our editorial independence\r\n.\r\nThe Philips Hue app … [+7209 chars]", "title": "6 awesome Philips Hue smart light features you’re not using", "fullContent": "The Philips Hue app has grown in complexity over the past several years, with more and more new features and settings being tucked into the user interface. That makes it all too easy to miss the latest and greatest in Hue functionality.\n\nBesides such newer features as light alarms and “mimic presence,” there are also old favorites like light timers and fade durations. Taken together, these (often well hidden) features can add polish to your Hue routines, keep your daily schedules on track, and even protect your home from would-be intruders.\n\nRead on for six hidden Hue features you need to try, starting with…\n\nMimic presence mode\n\nPhilips Hue recently made the jump into the home security market, adding a series of Hue Secure-branded cameras along with door and window sensors and floodlights, But even if you’re not ready to invest in a Hue camera, you can still boost your security with this built-in Hue feature.\n\nJust activate the “Mimic Presence” mode, and the Hue app will automatically turn your lights on and off to “mimic the activities that would be expected in those types of rooms,” perfect for scaring off burglars or anyone else thinking of sneaking into your empty home.\n\nThe “Mimic presence” feature is tucked into a long list of options on the Automations screen. Tap it, select one or more rooms, then select some or all the lights associated with the room. You can also set the mode to run all day, or only when it’s dark outside.\n\nTo trigger the “Mimic presence” mode, just locate it on the Automations tab and tap the “Play” button, or “Stop” to deactivate the mode. You can also set a Hue button to turn “Mimic presence” on or off, or map the mode to a Hue smartphone widget.\n\nLight alarms\n\nHere’s another Hue feature that can help keep your home safe. Rather than using audible alarms to ward off intruders, the Hue app can trigger light-based alarms that rapidly flash some or all of your Hue lights, ideal for spooking crooks as well as alerting your neighbors that something’s amiss.\n\nTo use light alarms, you’ll need a supporting device such as a Hue Secure camera, a Hue motion sensor (there are indoor and outdoor models), or a Hue contact sensor. You’ll also need to enable the Hue Security center (Settings > Security).\n\nAs you’re configuring Hue Security, it will guide you through the process of setting up a light alarm. For example, you’ll be able to decide which lights in your home should flash when the alarm is tripped, as well as whether your lights should flash white or red.\n\nYou can set your Philips Hue light alarms to flash either white or red. Ben Patterson/Foundry\n\nBesides a flashing light alarm, you can also create automations that trigger light scenes when a Hue sensor detects activity. For example, I created an automation that activates a bright light scene in my downstairs home office whenever the upstairs kitchen door is opened, handy for letting me know when my daughter comes home from school.\n\nIn my case, I drilled down to the settings for my Hue door and window sensors (Settings > Devices > Sensors > Contact Sensors), selected the lights that I wanted triggered (Office), then adjust the Behavior settings (“Bright” when the door is opened, “Return to previous state” when the door is closed).\n\nFade duration\n\nThe Hue app offers both wake up and sleep automations that will gradually boost or dim the brightness in the morning or at night, but you can also set any light scenes to gradually fade in or out.\n\nI find the “fade duration” setting particularly handy for smoothly changing daytime light scenes from, say, a warm morning glow to a cooler daytime look, all without making anyone in the room do a double-take. (The Hue app also has a “Natural Light” scene that changes the light temperature throughout the day, with an optional “transition time” between each time window. I just happen to prefer my own scene settings.)\n\nWhenever you create a custom automation (tap the Automations tab, then tap the blue “+” button in the top-right corner of the screen), the Fade Duration option will appear as you’re setting the start time for the routine. The duration itself can last for anywhere between five minutes to an hour.\n\nIf you’re adjusting an existing scene, you’ll need to tap “Start at” or “End at” to access the Fade Duration setting.\n\nLight effects\n\nHue lights can do more than just shine in solid colors or white color temperatures. They can also flicker, shimmer, and pulse in a variety of shades, perfect for simulating a candle, a fireplace, or a lava lamp.\n\nJust select any of your Hue lights in a room, then tap the Effects button (the one with a sparkly icon) next to the color and white color temperature controls. You’ll then see a variety of light effects, depending on the type of Hue light you’ve selected. Dimmable-only Hue white lights will offer Candle effects, while dimmable and tunable White Ambience lights will add Glisten and Sparkle effects. While and Color Ambience lights get even more effects, including Fireplace, Underwater, Cosmos, and Opal, all with different color options.\n\nAmong the Hue light effects you can choose are Candle, Fireplace (left), Underwater, and Cosmos (middle). You can also adjust the color, brightness, and speed for any of the effects (right). Ben Patterson/Foundry\n\nEven better, you can create your own custom effect for each category; tap Create Fireplace, for example, and you can pick your own color, as well as adjust the brightness and speed.\n\nOnce you’ve added effects for different lights in a room, you can create a scene with those effects by tapping the Save button.\n\nAnimated light scenes\n\nSpeaking of scenes, you can animate any Hue scene in a room (that is, any scenes aside from basic scenes like Bright, Dimmed, and Nightlight) with a single tap.\n\nIf you see a “Play” icon on a light scene, try tapping it; when you do, the scene will animate itself, pulsing gently according to its own rhythm. Tap the Edit button to change the brightness or speed of the animation, or to make the scene animate itself by default.\n\nLight timers\n\nNeed to set a timer but hate the blare of an audible alarm? Just as the Hue app offers light alarms, it also has light timers that can activate lighting scenes after a set duration of time.\n\nThis feature is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best smart lighting products.\n\nTap the “+” button on the Automations screen, then select the Timer option. You’ll need to set how long the timer should last (anywhere from a minute to 24 hours), which room or rooms will be included (or your entire home, if you like), and which scene you’d like activated when the timer ends.\n\nOnce that’s all set, you’ll see your new timer with a “Play” button at the top of your list of automations. Press the Play button, and when the countdown ends, the timer will trigger the lighting scene you selected."}

Zoe Lofgren late Jan… [+5857 chars]", "title": "Non-Transparency Resumed After Pirate Site Blacklist Publicly Exposed in Error", "fullContent": "Since shutting down most pirate sites is impossible, Germany's ISPs are given a secret list of pirate domains to block, which in theory hides the existence of the pirate sites from internet users. After it emerged that a local ISP had accidentally exposed the list to the public for the last 10 months, the unintended transparency was quietly yet swiftly reversed. This response provides another point for debate as site-blocking proposals heat up in the United States.\n\nAs debate heats up in the United States over proposed site-blocking legislation, opinions of what that might mean in practice are already beginning to emerge.\n\nIntroduced by Rep. Zoe Lofgren late January, the Foreign Anti-Digital Piracy Act (FADPA) attempts to distill well over a decade of site blocking experience amassed by U.S. rightsholders overseas, into a package carefully curated for use on home soil.\n\nSite-Blocking Debate Returns to Polarization\n\nShould it become law, FAPDA would allow rightsholders to obtain site blocking orders targeted at verified pirate sites, run by foreign or assumed foreign operators. The proposals as they stand today envision blocking orders that would apply to both ISPs and DNS resolvers, the latter an already controversial trend that has only recently shown momentum in Europe.\n\nAs proponents have made clear many times over the past 15 years or so, to remain effective site-blocking must continuously adapt. That necessarily means that the FADPA proposals on the table today are the starting point for U.S. site-blocking. For those advocating in favor of FADPA, especially as a highly predictable framework with guardrails for safety, the inherent need to adapt and expand presents challenges for longer-term assurances.\n\nNo Wild Predictions Required, Europe Holds the Answers\n\nUnlike the SOPA debate in 2012, where wild predictions one way or another had no clear historical basis, today there is a deep well of information to draw from, much of it the result of U.S. rightsholders’ implementation of site-blocking in Europe. As such, events there should be considered informative.\n\nEstablished four years ago, Germany operates an administrative site blocking regime which requires no direct legal oversight. A partnership between rightsholders and local ISPs saw the launch of the “Clearing Body for Copyright on the Internet” (CUII) which is now responsible for handing down blocking instructions against sites that structurally infringe copyright.\n\nRecommendations for blocking are published on the CUII website, along with redacted reports explaining investigators’ findings. The image below shows all recommendations for blocking since the program began.\n\nThis level of transparency is already a step up from broadly equivalent schemes seen elsewhere in Europe. However, in common with many of its counterparts elsewhere, the domains subsequently nominated by rightsholders and then blocked by ISPs are on a confidential list to which the public has no access. Or at least, that was the original plan.\n\nConfidential Block List Exposed By ISP\n\nA Netzpolitik report published last week revealed that Germany’s secret site-blocking list had been publicly available for at least 10 months via the URL rpz01do.versatel-west.de. Accidentally made available by ISP 1&1 Versatel, the URL let visitors see every domain blocked by local ISPs, enabling them to see how the list changed over time following numerous updates.\n\nWhile the CUII website lists 24 platforms for blocking, at last count the exposed list contained well over ten times more domains/subdomains, over 300 in total. For perspective, Germany’s site-blocking program is very modest when compared to schemes in the UK, France, Italy, and Spain, for example, where thousands of sites are blocked with information on domains mostly restricted.\n\nLast year we reported on the work of Damian, a then-17-year-old in Germany who lifted the veil of secrecy on the scale of domain blocking via the site cuiiliste.de.\n\n“CUII is a private organization that blocks websites that it believes violate copyright law – without any court orders. In addition, their approach seems very non-transparent in my opinion,” Damian said.\n\nDamian and others working on the project used various DNS-based techniques to establish which domains were blocked in Germany. However, he informs Netzpolitik that access to the ‘leaked’ master list helped to confirm that all blocked domains were present on the cuiliste.de site, something that can longer be guaranteed.\n\nThat’s because, predictably, as soon as 1&1 Versatel discovered its accidental transparency, measures were swiftly taken to ensure the list was hidden away as originally intended.\n\nSite-Blocking = Censorship?\n\nA pro-FADPA article published late last week by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation put forward reasons ‘Why the US Should Block Piracy’. One of a series of articles with a similar theme over the last few years, the piece describes site-blocking as “a no-brainer” and U.S. policy as having “international precedent.”\n\nThe crux of the piece dismisses concerns that FADPA could be used as a tool for censorship, and rejects the notion that the “one sided process” through which orders are obtained are “fundamentally flawed.” These are entrenched positions that have closed very little over the last 12+ years and will undoubtedly continue to rage as the months unfold.\n\n“[W]hen policymakers propose reasonable, legally sound tools to stop [piracy], critics respond with hyperbole, misdirection, and scare tactics,” the piece adds, a claim that has been utilized by both sides, if any at all.\n\nNo Censorship Where There’s Transparency\n\nClaims of censorship often depend on the context and the FADPA proposals in the U.S. will need to address those claims at some point, whether justified or not. However, while censorship and transparency have some similarities, the latter may deserve more attention.\n\nProposals in the U.S. suggest a system not dissimilar to those operating in Europe, with and without involvement of the courts. An initial blocking order against a platform will be made available to the public, but since those orders are likely to be flexible (‘dynamic’ in site-blocking parlance), permission will be granted to block additional resources without returning to court.\n\nFollowing the clear pattern on display in Europe, whatever rightsholders and ISPs agree to block privately, will be blocked, and if there is no transparency requirement, none will be forthcoming."}

But even so, it’s surprising to see a huge, high-profile game like Spider-Man 2 get taken down a peg. While Sony’s system-seller was “Steam Deck Verified” when it got its PC launch back in late January, it’s now marked as just “Playable” on its official store page.\n\nThe change was noted by KitGuru, which notes that the “Playable” downgrade means that Steam Deck users might need to make some adjustments and compromises to get a game running smoothly on the laptop-based hardware. That’s backed up by the warning on the Steam page itself, which says, “This game requires manual configuration of graphics settings to perform well on the Steam Deck.” Other possible pitfalls, like console-style controls and user interface icons, are clear.\n\nThe Steam Deck Compatibility program is a certification process run by Valve itself, with ratings ranging from “Verified” (no issues, good performance at default or automatic visual settings) to “Playable” (some small interface issues, possible manual tweaks to settings required) to “Unsupported” (simply not possible, because of graphical requirements or input limitations like full keyboard or VR games, or can’t run on Linux-based SteamOS). Another category, “Unknown,” means Valve hasn’t evaluated that particular game.\n\nSteam Deck compatibility—and the visibility thereof—is important to both Valve and Steam Deck owners. The “Great on Deck” category is the default Steam store view for the device. Most major new releases, including Spider-Man 2, are evaluated by Valve’s review team at launch. Valve states openly that the compatibility rating for a game can change over time… but the example it gives is that the rating can go up as a developer improves game compatibility. It’s strange to see a rating go down, apparently with some adjustment coming from Valve itself.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Spider-Man 2 received a major patch just five days ago, with allegedly improved visual performance and a fix for some AMD systems. It’s possible that Valve tested the game after the patch and adjusted the rating… or simply re-evaluated with a more critical eye. The original PC release of Spider-Man Remastered and the Miles Morales semi-sequel, both of which were originally released on the PS4, remain Steam Deck Verified at the time of writing."}

According to Nvidia’s promotional materials, models packing the discrete card will be available from “every major OEM,” including Acer, Asus, Dell/Alienware, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI, and Razer.\n\nNvidia says that models packing the mid-range Blackwell GPU will start at $1099 and be “as thin as 14.9mm,” or .59 inches, with availability beginning as soon as May. Though Nvidia didn’t specify how much video RAM will be packed into the RTX 5060 laptop card, 8GB seems like a safe bet, considering that’s what’s going into the base model RTX 5060 card on desktops, and the laptop 5070 already offers 8GB of VRAM.\n\nHow much performance can you expect? That’ll depend on the other components of your laptop, of course, not to mention variables in game design and settings. But directly comparing the new 5060 to the laptop 4060 and 3060 cards, Nvidia made a stunning claim: 146 frames per second for the 5060, versus 60 on the 4060 and just 21 on the 3060. That’s running a benchmark in Cyberpunk 2077 with “Max Settings” (presumably path tracing), DLSS quality mode, and max frame gen.\n\nNvidia\n\n“Max frame gen” is, presumably, how the newer card managed such a huge increase. DLSS 4 can create three “AI-generated” frames for every one fully rendered frame, which would largely account for the doubled framerate versus the 4060 card (which can only generate one AI frame for every rendered frame). Some critics call these “fake frames,” though the take from PCWorld reviewers Brad Chacos and Adam Patrick Murray is a little more nuanced. In short: it looks pretty amazing in games that support it, though it might not be relevant to you if you demand pure rendered performance.\n\nNvidia gave other examples of performance in popular games, without directly comparing to previous laptop cards. The quoted framerates were shown with the same setup: 100-watt TGP on the GPU, paired with a Core 9 Ultra, 1080p, maximum settings, and maximum frame generation.\n\nNvidia\n\nIt’s not surprising that every big gaming laptop manufacturer is on board, considering Nvidia’s domination of the graphics card industry even as end users yearn for more affordable hardware. An xx60 laptop that “starts” at $1100 is still pretty dang pricey — laptops with RTX 4060 cards can regularly be found on sale in the $700 range, albeit years after they debuted. And who knows how the prices will fluctuate as the Trump tariff situation in the US shifts, making a pig’s ear of any kind of pricing predictions that go beyond a single day."}

One of the most common causes of that is wear and tear. But before you zip out and buy a new mouse, there are a few other tips and settings you can look into first.\n\nMouse click settings\n\nFor starters, make sure the accidental double-clicks aren’t due to a change in system settings. In Windows 11, open the Start menu and search for Mouse settings to access mouse settings, then scroll down and select Additional mouse settings to launch Mouse Properties.\n\nIn Mouse Properties, look for the slider under the “Double-click speed” section. If the double-click speed is too low, your single clicks may sometimes be registered as double-clicks. Try adjusting the speed slider upwards (faster) and see if that solves the issue.\n\nProblematic mouse drivers\n\nAnother common reason for unintentional double-clicks is outdated or corrupted mouse drivers. Visit your mouse manufacturer’s website to check for the latest driver updates. Or you might be able to use a tool that automatically updates your outdated drivers.\n\nIf this measure doesn’t help, uninstall the current drivers via Windows Device Manager and restart your computer. Your operating system should automatically search for the latest mouse drivers and reinstall them.\n\nDirty mouse\n\nDirt or dust under the mouse button can sometimes be the cause of unintentional double-clicks. Many modern mouse models allow you to carefully lift the button to clean the area underneath.\n\nUse a soft cloth or a cotton swab to remove the dirt. Isopropyl alcohol (91% or 99%) can be helpful for stubborn dirt, but use it sparingly because it can degrade materials and damage sensitive components.\n\nLow battery or wireless interference\n\nIf you’re using a wireless mouse, check whether low batteries or interference from other devices (e.g., Wi-Fi routers or Bluetooth devices) could be causing your mouse to act up. Recharge or replace your batteries, and make sure the wireless receiver is positioned in direct line-of-sight with your mouse to avoid signal issues.\n\nOther potential fixes\n\nIf the accidental double-clicks persist, you can try using free software solutions such as Double-Click Fix (also available via the Microsoft Store). This app detects and filters out unintended double-clicks, which are determined by a minimal delay setting for valid double-clicks. Experiment with the setting to find the optimal delay time for yourself.\n\nIf all measures remain unsuccessful, your mouse is likely physically defective. You may be able to replace the switches instead of replacing the entire mouse. Spare parts can be found online, but replacement requires some technical skill and the right tools.\n\nBut without the proper know-how, you’re better off just buying a new mouse. Check out our recommendations for the best wireless mice, best budget gaming mice, and best wireless gaming mice."}

OneXPlayer is one such example, recently showing off some fascinating retro handheld designs. But what caught my eye this morning is something much, much bigger.\n\nThe OneXPlayer X1 Pro has been around for a while, boasting a massive 11-inch tablet-sized screen, detachable controllers, and a fold-down keyboard in the box. It’s kind of a Frankenstein’s monster of the original Nintendo Switch, the Microsoft Surface tablet, and the Steam Deck, complete with AMD-based hardware. In fact, the new model is using the massively powerful Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. But an even newer version (spotted by VideoCardz) has a chip of a different color inside.\n\nOneXplayer\n\nThe newest variant of the X1 Pro is packing an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H processor. It also has a massive 64GB of memory and 2TB of storage in its sole, limited-edition model. And in case you somehow missed it, the whole red-and-gold color scheme and promo art are modeled after EVA Unit 02 and its pilot Asuka from the 30-year-old anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. The keyboard looks particularly cool, and OneXPlayer has several other models with Evangelion themes.\n\nBetween the official anime licensing and the bombastic specs, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that this is a pricey bit of kit… but $1,650 USD on the MinixPC store will still raise a few eyebrows. To be fair, that’s around the same price as the version with the Ryzen AI HX 370 and the same specs, though it’s far more pricey than the Claw 8 AI+ from MSI, the only major manufacturer putting Intel chips in handhelds. In fact, at that price, a gamer on the go might also consider the Asus ROG Flow Z13, which will probably take up about the same space in your bag.\n\nOneXplayer\n\nThat said, gaming handhelds (if you can call an 11-inch tablet a handheld—oh hi, Acer, when did you get here?) with this much power are a niche category by definition, so perhaps OneXPlayer is banking on low volumes and high profit margins. I must admit, I’d love to see how this particular machine handles, say, Armored Core VI."}

This was right after OpenAI released its GPT-4 showcase, and the general reaction was that human software developers were about to be made redundant, that software would soon be written exclusively by machines.\n\nI was skeptical of these claims, and in that blog post, I made the case for why I thought software development would still require humans for the foreseeable future. My hypothesis was that LLMs would augment human developers, not replace them.\n\nAt the time, the conventional wisdom on Twitter was that it would only be a few months before AI extinguished all demand for human front-end developers, maybe a year or two at most. Well, it’s been over two years since then! So, were they right? Are we currently living in the “post-developer” era?\n\nIn this blog post, I want to take a fresh look at the current landscape, to see how things have changed, and to see if we can anticipate how things will continue to evolve. If you’re an aspiring developer who is feeling anxious about your future career, my hope is that this post will give you some clarity. ❤️\n\nLink to this heading Companies and AI usage\n\nOver the past few years, companies have definitely been adopting AI tools more and more. For example, Forbes recently published an article titled “AI Writes Over 25% Of Code At Google” (opens in new tab).\n\nThe article’s title makes it sound like AI is doing 25% of the work and human developers are doing the other 75%, but that’s not actually what’s going on here. That title is misleading, in my opinion.\n\nAI may be generating 25% of the code that gets committed at Google, but it’s not acting independently. A skilled human developer is in the driver’s seat, using their knowledge and experience to guide the AI, editing and shaping its output, and mixing it in with the code they’ve written. As far as I know, 100% of code at Google is still being created by developers. AI is just one of many tools they use to do their job.\n\nIn other words, it’s not like product teams at Google have fired 25% of their developers and replaced them with pseudo-sentient AI robots who work autonomously and report directly to the product manager. I haven’t heard of that happening at any large tech companies.\n\nNow, there are startups who claim that their AIs can fully replace human developers. The most popular of these is Devin, a product created by Cognition and released a year ago, in March 2024. But when companies actually try to use it, they run into problems. For example, one team found that Devin could only complete 3 out of 20 assigned tasks (opens in new tab), and it was ultimately more trouble than it was worth. They gave up after a month.\n\nHere’s some of what their team had to say about it:\n\nTasks it can do are those that are so small and well-defined that I may as well do them myself, faster, my way. Larger tasks where I might see time savings I think it will likely fail at. So no real niche where I’ll want to use it. Johno Whitaker\n\nI had initial excitement at how close it was because I felt I could tweak a few things. And then slowly got frustrated as I had to change more and more to end up at the point where I would have been better of [sic] starting from scratch and going step by step. Isaac Flath\n\nThese quotes aren’t from AI skeptics, they’re from a technical team who work for an AI startup, trying the product with enthusiasm and in good faith. And their experience isn’t unusual. I’ve read a handful of other real-world reports, and they all arrive at the same conclusion: this just doesn’t work that well.\n\nAs far as I can tell, every AI success story still has skilled human developers as a necessary ingredient. So, I think it’s safe to say that we’re not living in the post-developer era.\n\nLink to this heading Drifting off-road\n\nOver the past couple of years, I’ve experimented with a lot of AI tooling myself. A few months back, I switched to Cursor (opens in new tab), an AI-powered IDE. I’ve been using its “agent” mode with Claude Sonnet, and I have to admit, it’s pretty remarkable. For certain kinds of tasks, I can give it some context and point it in the right direction, and it whips up a working solution on the first try.\n\nIt’s smart enough to catch and often fix TypeScript or lint errors, and there have even been a few times that I’ve learned something new, where the suggested solution was better than what I had planned to write, thanks to some cool API I wasn’t aware of.\n\nBut it’s not perfect. It does require guidance.\n\nIt feels a bit like driving on the highway with “cruise control”: the car mostly goes where you point it, but you still need a hand on the steering wheel, keeping it steady. Otherwise, the car will slowly start to drift out of its lane. If you don’t occasionally nudge it back on track, you’ll wind up in a ditch.\n\nAnd that’s kind of a problem for the “no more developers” theory. If I didn’t know how to code, I wouldn’t notice the subtle-yet-critical issues with the model’s output. I wouldn’t know how to course-correct, or even realize that course-correction was required!\n\nI’ve heard from no-coders who have built projects using LLMs, and their experience is similar. They start off strong, but eventually reach a point where they just can't progress anymore, no matter how much they coax the AI. The code is a bewildering mess of non sequiturs, and beyond a certain point, no amount of duct tape can keep it together. It collapses under its own weight.\n\nAlso, there are lots of tasks that LLMs just aren’t very good at. There have been times where I’ve spent a frustrating 10 minutes trying to get Claude to understand what I want before giving up and taking 5 minutes to build it myself. I’ve started developing an intuition for which tasks should be delegated to the AI, and which should be tackled the old-fashioned way.\n\nOn balance, LLMs do save me a significant amount of time. There have been cases where the LLM does 30 minutes of work for me in 30 seconds, and those cases are exhilarating. But, honestly, I think I still spend the majority of the time writing code myself.\n\nIt’s like a tag team wrestling match; when I hit a task that Claude would excel at, I tap out and let him tackle it. But I’m still the one writing the code most of the time, since it’s faster or easier to do it myself.\n\nLink to this heading The current job market\n\nWhen I wrote this post a couple of years back, it was a pretty tough time in the job market. Unfortunately, things are still pretty tough out there.\n\nIf you’re a job-seeker, you know that there aren’t as many high-quality job listings as there used to be, and the good ones get swamped with applications. It’s very hard to get an interview, let alone an offer.\n\nBut I don’t think this is because companies are actually replacing their developers with autonomous AI agents. As I’ve shared, the real-world experiences I’ve read just don’t support that hypothesis. So what gives? Why is it still so brutal out there?\n\nI think there are a few factors:\n\nMacro-economic stuff. Interest rates are still relatively high, making it harder for startups to attract the funding they need to grow and hire developers. For several years now, the general economic sentiment has been that we’re on the cusp of a recession. Layoffs. Big tech companies laid off hundreds of thousands of workers over the past couple of years, for a variety of reasons. This means that there are tons of highly-qualified devs out there, looking for work. AI myths. Some companies are still operating under the belief that AI really will make developers obsolete soon, and so they’re not hiring as aggressively as they otherwise would.\n\nThat last point is particularly frustrating. Companies are not hiring the developers they need because they’re convinced that AGI? Artificial General Intelligence: an AI that can learn and reason like a human, to accomplish any task, even ones that it was never trained to do is right around the corner, and when that egg hatches, we won’t need human developers at all anymore. “It’ll be any week now”, they’ve been saying for years. 😅\n\nLink to this heading Looking forward\n\nWhen I wrote “The End of Front-End Development” (opens in new tab) back in 2023, I was trying to reach aspiring developers, folks who are in the process of learning to code, right at the start of their career. I saw how bleak everyone’s predictions were, and wanted to provide a counterweight to all of the FUD? Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt I saw online.\n\nAnd for everything that has changed over the past two years, two things have stayed the same:\n\nCompanies still need human developers to build their products. AI Evangelists are still claiming that, any day now, companies won’t need human developers to build their products.\n\nIf you’re an aspiring developer, in college or a bootcamp or studying on your own, I still fully believe that there will be opportunities for you when you’re ready to enter the workforce. It seems clear to me that we’re still a long way from software development becoming fully automated. And once companies realize that AI works much better as a developer enhancer than as a developer replacement, I think they’ll stop sabotaging their own growth and start hiring at a more vigorous pace.\n\nThere’s no doubt that AI models will continue to improve. It seems like every week, a new model gets released that breaks records on one benchmark or other. Most recently, it was Google’s turn when they announced Gemini 2.0 Flash and 2.5 Pro models (opens in new tab).\n\nIt seems to me like we’ve reached the point in the technology curve where progress starts becoming more incremental; it’s been a while since anything truly game-changing has come out. Each new model is a little bit better, but it’s more about improving the things it already does well rather than conquering all-new problems.\n\nAnd as bleak as the job market feels right now, things are trending in the right direction, at least in the US:\n\nCredit to Joey Politano (opens in new tab) for the lovely graph!\n\nIf AI truly was making software developers redundant, I would expect the total number of tech jobs to be falling at an accelerating rate, but the count has been increasing over the past year. If this trend continues, the market should feel a lot less brutal soon!\n\nLink to this heading Concerns\n\nIn 2023, I was reasonably confident that AI wasn’t on the cusp of taking our software jobs. Two years in, and I’ve only become more confident in that belief. Knowing how to code is still an incredibly valuable skill and I don’t see that changing anytime soon.\n\nThat said, I’m also not trying to say that everything is great and we’ll all be just fine. 😅\n\nLast year, Americans inexplicably re-elected a wildly incompetent conman to be president. We’re only a couple of months in, and Trump has already torched the world economy, gutted the federal government, made it an unsafe place to visit for non-citizens, and started a global trade war. It’s hard to anticipate what effect this’ll have on the tech industry, but it certainly won’t be good.\n\nI also worry a bit about the next generation of developers. When using LLM agents, it’s so easy to get lulled into a trance, to keep hitting “accept changes” without understanding or even looking at the code being generated * “vibe coding”, as it’s known among the cool kids . I caught myself starting to fall into this trap when I was building the landing page for my new course (opens in new tab). I took my hand off the steering wheel for too long, and had to spend a bunch of time refactoring funky junk code as a result.\n\nThe path of least resistance is to sit back and let the machine do its thing, but this prevents us from building the skills we’ll need to debug and fix the code when the machine inevitably gets stuck.\n\nOn the other hand, if you use LLMs proactively, there’s never been a better time to learn how to code. When I get a TypeScript error I don’t understand, AI can often help me understand it, or at least surface the relevant keywords I need in order to find the right docs. It’s like we all have access to our own personal tutor who can help us make sense of things we don’t understand. * Although, that tutor is occasionally on LSD, so we do have to be a little wary of their suggestions 😂\n\nNobody knows how the next few years will play out, but it wouldn’t surprise me at all if we see a bit of a “developer renaissance” in a year or two, when companies have finally accepted that human developers are still required, when they realize that a skilled human armed with a powerful LLM can do incredible things. ✨\n\nIf you’re passionate about software development, or if you see it as the best opportunity for you to earn a high salary that’ll lift you into the upper middle class, I really hope you won’t let yourself get discouraged by AI hype. Companies are still hiring, and I don’t see that stopping anytime soon. 💖\n\nJob-hunting tips Let’s talk about how to maximize our chances for success in the current job market! The first thing to realize is that AI has made the hiring process miserable for companies. Job postings will sometimes get thousands of AI-generated slop applications, and it’s hard for them to sift through all of the junk. If you apply for an open role, it’s very possible that it’ll get buried under a mountain of garbage. So, I think there are two solutions to this: Try to apply very early, within the first couple of days that a job is posted.\n\nLean on your network. If you’re brand new to tech, you probably don’t have a network. That’s ok! You can start building one today. 😄 There are so many different ways to do this. The most obvious is to look for local meetups in your area, which can be a great option to meet developers who work for companies you might want to work for. They can help make sure your application doesn’t get lost in the pile. But honestly, if you’re as introverted as I am, this may not be the best option for you. When I tried going to local meetups at the start of my career, I was too shy to approach strangers, so I never met anybody and it never did me any good. 😅 Fortunately, there are lots of other options. I built my network by building cool stuff and sharing it online. You can contribute to open-source projects, or get to know people in Discord communities. You’ll have the most success if you lean into your strengths, as I share in my blog post “Becoming a Software Developer Without a CS Degree”. Also, your community can also help you discover opportunities. Frustratingly, there are lots of online job postings for made-up companies that exist purely as data-harvesting operations. Instead, you can browse through your contacts on LinkedIn and see where they work, and build a list of definitely-real companies to track. It’s rough out there, but hopefully these tips help save you some time and trouble! ❤️"}

Archaeologist Lorena Paiz, who led the discovery, said the altar was believed to have been used for sacrifices, “especially of children”. “The remains of three children not older than four years were found on three sides of the altar,” Paiz revealed. The altar was found within a Teotihuacan residential complex which typically feature houses with rooms and central altars, according to Paiz.\n\nAnd while the discovery might add an interesting new dimension to the historical accounts of the region, an academic’s attempt to paint the sacrifice of children as “not violent” and the unquestioning recitation of the explanation for it by mainstream media stirred a great deal of controversy.\n\nNon-violent child sacrifice?

For example, here is the exact quote from the Associated Press.\n\nMaría Belén Méndez, an archaeologist who was not involved with the project, said the discovery confirms “that there has been an interconnection between both cultures and what their relationships with their gods and celestial bodies was like.” “We see how the issue of sacrifice exists in both cultures. It was a practice; it’s not that they were violent, it was their way of connecting with the celestial bodies,” she said.\n\nThe detached analysis hit a nerve, and the statement was slammed by many on social media. Mario Nawfal, entrepreneur and host of “The Roundtable Show” on X.com, derided it as a leftist attempt to defend the slaughter as “spiritual”.\n\nArchaeologist María Belén Méndez claims this wasn’t violence at all—just a “connection with celestial bodies.” This is the modern progressive mindset: romanticize ritual child murder, rewrite barbarism as cultural nuance, and call depravity “divine.” These are the same people lecturing you about morality, history, and who should run society. If you ever needed proof the far-left has completely lost its moral compass—this is it.\n\n🚨🇺🇸EXTREME LEFTISTS DEFEND CHILD SACRIFICE AS “SPIRITUAL”—YES, REALLY 3 toddlers under the age of 4 were found buried at a Teotihuacan altar in Guatemala—sacrificed in blood-soaked rituals to ancient gods.

They were long-standing enemies of the Aztecs, having suffered from years of warfare and Aztec demands for tribute and human sacrifices. After initial battles with the Spanish, the Tlaxcalans decided to ally with Cortés, providing him with thousands of warriors, supplies, and strategic support. Their alliance was pivotal in the siege and eventual fall of Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital.\n\nGUATEMALA A 1,700 year old altar in Guatemala has been uncovered by archaeologists They found that it was used for human sacrifices, especially those of children under 4 The gruesome discovery shows the evil that was ended by the arrival of Christianity thanks to Spain pic.twitter.com/ObyOYmwLbl — Catholic Arena (@CatholicArena) April 14, 2025\n\nReturning to the Mayans, it turns out that there is no consensus on how many of its people they “non-violently” sacrificed. Archaeological studies at sites like Chichén Itzá have uncovered dozens to hundreds of sacrificial victims, often children, but these numbers represent accumulations over centuries.\n\nMeanwhile, this Holy Week, this is what the children of Guatemala are doing now.\n\nHoly Week in Guatemala 🇬🇹 with children joining the procession It’s incredible how traditions can vary so much around the world pic.twitter.com/HonX0ZuR32 — Mambo Italiano (@mamboitaliano__) April 14, 2025\n\nOne last note, as it is related:\n\n1/ Wherever Christians went, children’s lives got better.

The nth most popular song is played with probability proportional to 1/n.\n\nThis post is a variation on that post looking at text consisting of the the 1,000 most common words in a language, where word frequencies follow Zipf’s law.\n\nHow many words of text would you expect to read until you’ve seen all 1000 words at least once? The math is the same as in the radio station post. The simulation code is the same too: I just changed a parameter from 100 to 1,000.\n\nThe result of a thousand simulation runs was an average of 41,246 words with a standard deviation of 8,417.\n\nThis has pedagogical implications. Say you were learning a foreign language by studying naturally occurring text with a relatively small vocabulary, such as newspaper articles. You might have to read a lot of text before you’ve seen all of the thousand most common words.\n\nOn the one hand, it’s satisfying to read natural text. And it’s good to have the most common words reinforced the most. But it might be more effective to have slightly engineered text, text that has been subtly edited to make sure common words have not been left out. Ideally this would be done with such a light touch that it isn’t noticeable, unlike heavy-handed textbook dialogs."}

Today, Nvidia unveiled not one, not two, but three new GeForce RTX 5060-series GPUs, starting at $299.\n\nThat $299 offering, the vanilla 8GB GeForce RTX 5060, won’t hit the streets until sometime in May. But the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti arrives tomorrow, April 16, with your choice of memory configurations: 8GB for $379 or 16GB for $429.\n\nWhile the RTX 5060 Ti has graphical prowess to play at 1440p in many titles, these GPUs will probably be better suited for 1080p gaming given their tiny 128-bit bus and mere 8GB of GDDR7 memory in all but the tippity-top offering. Check out the specs below.\n\nNvidia\n\nThose paltry 8GB memory buffers are sure to raise some eyebrows. Gamers have been saying “8GB ain’t enough” for years now, as numerous cutting-edge games have run into performance issues caused by exceeding 8GB memory capacity. Think lowered texture details, stuttering, or even a flat-out refusal to run in some cases.\n\nIntel’s $250 Arc B580 packs 12GB of (slower GDDR6) memory across a wider 192-bit bus to avoid capacity issues, but Nvidia decided to stick with the smaller amount, ostensibly to reduce cost.\n\nGeForce product management director Justin Walker acknowledged that 8GB of VRAM capacity might not deliver maximum performance in all circumstances, especially if settings are pushed in intense games. “If you want to play Indiana Jones and the Great Circle maxed out at 1440p resolution, yeah, i think the 16GB version is for you.” That said, Walker asked, “How do we get you a product with the best possible performance for dollar?” He said Nvidia balances by targeting most use cases. Most people playing most games, especially outside of Ultra settings, will do fine with 8GB of VRAM, he said.\n\nRTX 5060 Ti benchmark numbers provided by Nvidia. Nvidia\n\nRTX 5060 benchmark numbers provided by Nvidia. Nvidia\n\nTo back up that assertion, Nvidia released benchmark charts for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060 showing that the cards perform and respond much faster than the RTX 3060 Ti (which doesn’t support AI Frame Generation) and the 4060 Ti (which only supports 2x Frame Gen) when you activate Nvidia’s killer suite of features. Those include normal DLSS upscaling, 4x Multi Frame Generation, and the latency-busting Nvidia Reflex tool. (Delta Force in the charts above lack Frame Gen, but support Reflex.)\n\nThat was the theme of Nvidia’s press briefing: Don’t just look at base rasterization numbers (which Walker said would only be 20 to 25 percent faster than the 4060 series) but the peak experience, with all features activated. Not everyone embraces AI features, but a whole lot of gamers do, and the screenshots below show what the RTX 5060 series is capable of if you go whole-hog on Nvidia features.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia\n\nI said it before, and I’ll say it again: Nvidia bet the entire RTX 50-series on DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Gen feature. Fortunately, it works like black magic, delivering exceptional frame pacing and ultra-smooth visuals with good responsiveness – assuming you’re able to hit roughly a 60 frames-per-second base rendering frame rate before flipping MFG on.\n\nWill the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti be able to do that? We’ll know when those cards launch as a barrage of custom models — there’s no Founders Edition for these parts — starting tomorrow (April 16) for the 5060 Ti, followed by the RTX 5060 in May. Independent reviews should hopefully give us a full scope of the RTX 5060 series’ capability sooner than later. Stay tuned."}

Everybody — anybody — off the street can sit down and enjoy that,” Coogler told IndieWire during a recent interview. “It ended up becoming a very complicated grilled cheese sandwich, but that was where we were at at first.”\n\nCoogler also compared his temporary departure from IP-driven studio films to Jon Favreau’s detour to make “Chef” after making “Iron Man.” But “Sinners” is nothing like the cozy food movie “Chef.” It’s a period drama and gangster film that turns into a sexy and musical vampire action film, all of it deeply personal to Coogler’s roots, inspired by the birth of Blues music, and one starring Michael B. Jordan as two twin leads, no less!\n\n“That’s when we know we’re in the right place at the right time, when our movie is difficult to describe, and it feels weird, and people furrow their eyebrows when they hear it,” Coogler said. “Because that’s kind of what makes us us. That’s when we’re doing a Proximity film.”\n\nThough Coogler has proven he can consistently deliver at the box office, “Sinners” is a $90 million original film not based on IP. It represents a major test and risk for Coogler and his production banner Proximity Media, as well as Warner Bros. Pictures and its film chiefs Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy, for whom “Sinners” is just the first of several pricey and ambitious projects driven by name-brand filmmakers to come this year.\n\nThe two took a victory lap on the backs of “A Minecraft Movie” this month, but they still need “Sinners” to be a commercial hit. Proximity could help.\n\nCoogler said that, though it may seem otherwise on the surface, “Sinners” is not intended for a niche audience. Like all of Proximity’s films, it’s intended to be an “exhilarating experience” for whomever is up for taking that ride. Coogler described it as delivering a Michelin Star restaurant experience in a McDonald’s.\n\nSev Ohanian, Zinzi Coogler, and Ryan Coogler at a screening for ‘Sinners’\n\n“We aim to tell stories about characters, subject matters that are often overlooked, but tell them in the most eventized platform that we can,” said Zinzi Coogler, Coogler’s wife and partner at Proximity, be it through Proximity’s narrative film or TV slate, or its non-fiction and podcast divisions. “We keep that at the center of us. That’s what makes us a unique voice within the industry. And that’s what we’ll continue to aim to do, to find those voices. We’ve been fortunate to have filmmakers that we want to champion and support and execute on their visions for what their stories are.”\n\nIn recent weeks, Coogler has been on a media blitz in support of the film, and while it didn’t get a festival rollout, Warner Bros. has pushed the film as part of premieres and events in New York, Mexico City, and Los Angeles. IMAX has also touted the movie, staging some 70mm screenings at 10 different locations. To date, “Sinners” still has a perfect 100 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes and an impressive 83 out of 100 on Metacritic. IndieWire called it Coogler’s best film of his career.\n\nThough it seems like Coogler has been a mainstay in the industry for quite a while, “Sinners” is only Proximity’s fourth theatrical feature. Up next, they have two Marvel series coming out soon as part of an overall deal with Disney for television, including “Ironheart” and the animated “Eyes of Wakanda” series. But they’re intending to partner with past collaborators on future projects and have more to tease soon.\n\nSev Ohanian, Coogler’s production partner whom he met at film school at USC, says Coogler is someone who makes “incredibly audience-friendly movies with substance,” and that is reflected in all the titles Proximity hopes to produce. But he also believes that the makeup of the company and the people it works with sets itself apart from other production companies. The people being hired are not coming up as assistants or development executives but are independent, freelance financiers and storytellers, or part of Proximity’s popular internship program.\n\n“Where we have found success as a company is really being heat-seeking missiles when it comes to making a project, trying to just skip through all the BS and really put it together in a way that actually can get us results,” Ohanian said. “It’s how we made movies like ‘Fruitvale Station’ and even [Ohanian’s’] ‘Searching.” We’re probably entering a new phase of our company.”\n\n‘Fruitvale Station’\n\n“Sinners” is an interesting test case for another reason: the film was made at Warner Bros. under the pretense that Proximity Media would again own the film’s IP after 25 years of WBD’s right to distribute the film, a similar model to what Quentin Tarantino secured for “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” It’s a bet Coogler is making on himself and the film’s future value, something rare in an age when building a library of IP is more valuable for studios than ever before.\n\nCoogler explained that, for Proximity, every project is bespoke, so this deal will not necessarily be replicated for all of his future titles. But for “Sinners,” a movie about sharecroppers opening their own business and establishing their culture with music, hanging on to the rights fit the film’s theme, and “it makes sense to ask for this.”\n\n“I’m not the first filmmaker to get it. Warner Bros. is not the only studio that has done this with projects, though sometimes reading articles it seems like it,” Coogler said. “Much has been made of it, but this is such a personal story. And looking up, I’m not 40 years old yet, but I’ve had this opportunity due to some of the success I’ve had making movies for the studios, and I’ll forever be thankful to Warner Bros. and to frankly the other studios that offered it. It’s an opportunity now.”\n\nIf “Sinners” does succeed, we’ll all be curious as to what Coogler decides to grill up next."}

Just in time for Spring – and to commemorate the volatile egg prices we’ve been seeing – there’s the H. Moser & Cie Pioneer Centre Seconds Sunny-Side Up.\n\nPioneer Centre Seconds Sunny-Side Up: what it is\n\nWell, at this point, if you’re not familiar with the Pioneer Centre Seconds, I would be surprised. However, on the off-chance: the Pioneer lineup represents the “sporty” side of the brand, with mostly matte surfaces that lend themselves to hard wear. Pair that to a 120m WR rating and the rubber strap and a steel case, well, that feels like a sporty watch. Of course, everything is relative, and there are definitely refined touches as well.\n\nAbout that dial\n\nThe dial of the Pioneer Centre Seconds Sunny-Side Up is probably one of the most refined components. Here, of course, we have the fumé enamel dial that gives things a look that would be hard to produce any other way (also, take note of the “ghost” logo at 12 o’clock). Color is often the name of the game on these dials, and here they’ve gone with a bright yellow.\n\nThey went with a gradient on the dial that darkens at the edges. That looks a little weird for an egg yolk (if we’re embracing the theme); if there was going to be two tones, perhaps another hue of yellow or even the orange that you see in eggs yolks coming from well-fed chickens and ducks would make sense. Zoom out from just the dial, though, and the yellow makes sense for the egg theme against the white of the strap.\n\nAnd the movement?\n\nMoser makes good-looking watches, but that doesn’t mean that they ignore the actual engineering of the watch. Here, it’s the HMC 201 taking up residence, which is the evolution of the HMC 200 (which we talked about here). It’s functionally the same, it’s just exposing more of the gear train, and also has a skeletonized rotor (all visible through the exhibition caseback). Basic time indication (hours, minutes, and seconds) along with a three-day power reserve, means you’ll be good to go.\n\nWrapping things up\n\nIn general, I am a fan of the Pioneer line, though I tend to find myself drawn to one of their many blue dials. That said, the Pioneer Centre Seconds Sunny-Side Up is a nice bright diversion in the color palette, and could be a fun one for someone who is fan of raising backyard birds for the eggs.

Oracle データベースにアクセスする MCP サーバーを作ってみました。\n\nこんな感じでテーブルの構造を聞いてみたり\n\nこんな感じで LLM に SQL を書かせて、その場でテストしてみたりすることができます。\n\nこちら↓の Claude Desktop と私のチャットの履歴を見ていただくと、Claude Desktop のような出来の良い MCP Host とデータベースの MCP サーバーがあると何ができるのかイメージし易いかもしれません。\n\nさらに動画でもご紹介\n\nなんなら経営戦略策定もお願いできます！\n\nMCP は、「AIモデルが自由に着脱可能な手足や感覚器官の共通インターフェース規格であり、AIモデルの外界との相互作用を大きく促進する可能性を秘めている」という雰囲気のAIモデルをパワーアップしてくれるプロトコルです。これを作ったのはClaude の Anthropic 社ですので \"Modular Open Nervous-system for Embodied Transformer\" ＝ MONET が良かったのでは？\n\nそれはさておき、MCP は、LLMがさまざまなツールやリソースにアクセスするための仕組みです。これにより、LLMはファイルシステム、データベース、APIなどの外部リソースと容易に連携できるようになります。CursorやClaude DesktopなどのMCPホスト（クライアント）は、この仕組みを活用してLLMの能力を拡張して、開発環境としての開発者の体験を向上させることができます。\n\nMCP のコンポーネント\n\nMCP は以下のような３つのコンポーネントで構成されるクライアント・サーバーアーキテクチャを採用しています。\n\nホスト：ユーザーが直接対話するアプリケーション（Claude Desktop、CursorなどのIDE、カスタムエージェント）で、AIモデルが必要に応じてクライアントを通して、サーバーを利用します\n\nクライアント：ホストアプリケーション内に存在し、特定のMCPサーバーへの接続を管理します\n\nサーバー：標準APIを通じてツール、リソース、プロンプトを公開する外部プログラムで、プロキシーのような役割を担います\n\n作ったもの\n\n今回、作成したのは、MCPサーバーです。 コードは、以下の Github リポジトリで公開してます。\n\n更新： 2025/5/3 13:00 以前に clone された方は、pull し直してください SELECT AI / SELECT AI with RAG に対応しました（動作イメージ） 2025/4/19 01:40 以前に clone された方は、pull し直してください UNION

を指定して他のスキーマのテーブル構造を取得できるようになりました\n\n\n\nこの「MCP Server for Oracle Database」は、LLMがOracle Databaseに対してSQLクエリを実行できるようにするMCPサーバーの実験的な実装です。ローカル環境で動作し、CursorやClaude DesktopなどのMCPホスト（クライアント）から利用できます。\n\nCursor などでコード開発をしているときにデータベースの構造を確認したくなったり、SQLをテストしてみたいときにCursorなどのチャットウィンドウを離れることなく Oracle データベースと連携することができます。\n\n主な機能\n\nOracle DatabaseへのSQLクエリ実行（原則としてSELECT文のみ） SELECT AI / SELECT AI with RAG に対応（2025/5/3） PL/SQL ブロック内の DBMS_CLOUD_AI パッケージのうち安全なプロシージャ/関数の実行に対応 EXEC DBMS_CLOUD_AI.SET_PROFILE()に対応

の構文が利用できるようになりました\n\nテーブル一覧の取得（2025/4/16 Updated）\n\nテーブル構造の取得\n\n若干のセキュリティ対策（クエリ長制限、危険なキーワードチェックなど）\n\n結果のフォーマット機能（いらないかも） mcp.types.TextContent でクエリーの結果とエラーメッセージのみ返すように修正しました。区切り線などの余計な装飾を省いたので返却されるデータ量を減らすことができましたが、代わりにこれまで Claude Desktop が綺麗な表をマークダウンで作ってくれていたものが、「表にして」と指示する必要があるケースが増えました（2025/4/16 Updated）\n\nMCP のプロンプト機能を使って、LLMに対して tool

The charity based in the U.K. — including Northern Ireland, where McIlroy was born — focuses on helping children and adults with learning disabilities.\n\nFor example, on April 13, a manager of a Facebook page named Golf Plus shared a post (archived) reading, \"GOOD NEWS. Rory McIlroy has donated $4.2 million in prize money from donning the green jacket after completing the Grand Slam at The Masters 2025 to children's charity Mencap.\" The pos t, which referenced McIlroy's achievement of a career Grand Slam — the term for winning all four major golf championships at least once — r eceived more than 53,000 reactions, 3,700 comments and 5,100 shares, as of this writing.\n\n(Golf Plus/Facebook)\n\nOther users shared the same rumor on Facebook, Threads and X.\n\nWhile McIlroy truly has donated in support of Mencap in the past, no demonstrable evidence confirmed that he gave the charity $4.2 million following his 2025 Masters victory in Augusta, Georgia. As of April 15, searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo displayed no results from credible news media outlets reporting on the matter.\n\nFurther, on April 16, Mencap Northern Ireland published a statement (archived) on X, attributable to Graínne Close, director of Mencap Northern Ireland, who said the rumor was \"not accurate.\"\n\nA representative for McIlroy did not yet respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIn December 2016, Mencap Northern Ireland announced (archived) McIlroy's visit to one of its new facilities in Belfast. The news release said that, on Dec. 21, 2016, \"Northern Ireland golf hero Rory McIlroy, made his first visit to the new Mencap Centre in Belfast, following his donation of £500,000 from the Rory Foundation to support the build of the facility.\" In 2017, the official Mencap NI account also wished McIlroy luck in the British Open.\n\nWhy such false rumors exist\n\nThe Golf Plus Facebook post (archived) featured a comment from a page manager linking to an advertisement-filled article. A fairly simplistic WordPress website named Luxury Blog hosted the story, which began as follows:\n\nIn an inspiring act of generosity, golf superstar Rory McIlroy has donated his entire $4.2 million prize from winning the 2025 Masters Tournament to Mencap, a leading UK charity dedicated to supporting children and adults with learning disabilities. The announcement, made shortly after McIlroy claimed his first green jacket and completed the career Grand Slam at Augusta National, has drawn widespread admiration, highlighting his commitment to philanthropy as much as his brilliance on the course. McIlroy's victory at the 89th Masters was a historic moment, marking his fifth major championship and placing him among an elite group of six golfers to win all four majors. The Northern Irishman triumphed in a thrilling sudden-death playoff against Justin Rose, sinking a dramatic birdie putt on the 18th hole to secure the title. The win earned him a record-breaking $4.2 million, the largest first-place prize in Masters history, from a total purse of $21 million. Yet, in a move that stunned fans and underscored his values, McIlroy chose to give every penny to Mencap, a cause he has long supported through his charitable endeavors.\n\nScans of the article's text with the artificial-intelligence detection websites Copyleaks, QuillBot and ZeroGPT all indicated that someone likely generated the story with an AI tool. Also, the Luxury Blog website lacked signs of credibility, such as legal pages for terms and conditions and a privacy policy. Further, the \"Contact Us\" page showed fake contact information including \"Phone: (123) 456-7890\" and \"Address: 123 es.ulpgc.dacd.businessunit.Main Street City, State, ZIP Code Country.\"\n\nA similar false rumor shared on Facebook earlier in April claimed McIlroy donated his $4.5 million in earnings from his March victory at The Players Championship to Mencap. Posts promoting this rumor also featured author-submitted comments leading to advertisement-filled articles on untrustworthy websites.\n\nThe goal of these untrue rumors — at least partially, if not wholly — appeared to be to earn advertising revenue for the owners of the websites hosting the articles, which, again, someone likely generated with AI tools.\n\nFor further golf-themed reading, we previously examined whether photos showed the aftermath of an alligator tearing off a golfer's arm."}

Gilbert; Terry Regier; Paul Kay; Richard B. Ivry.\n\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (2006)\\\n\nThese two articles (The Conversation and phys.org/news) are journalistic accounts of the scientific study by Kemp, Vylomova, Khishigsuren, and Regier.\n\nThe full scientific paper is here:\n\nTemuulen Khishigsuren et al, \"A computational analysis of lexical elaboration across languages\", Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2025). DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2417304122\n\nJournal information: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n\nSignificance The vocabulary of any language emphasizes some areas more than others, and the number of terms for fish, cattle, smells, and other concepts varies across languages. Most work on lexical elaboration relies on manually compiled data, but we show how lexical elaboration can be measured using data from bilingual dictionaries, and use this measure to develop analyses of lexical elaboration that span hundreds of languages and thousands of concepts. Our work suggests several hypotheses about well-studied concepts (e.g. that smell terms are well developed in Oceanic languages), and opens up the investigation of concepts that are new to the literature on lexical elaboration (e.g. dance). Abstract Claims about lexical elaboration (e.g. Mongolian has many horse-related terms) are widespread in the scholarly and popular literature. Here, we show that computational analyses of bilingual dictionaries can be used to test claims about lexical elaboration at scale. We validate our approach by introducing BILA, a dataset including 1,574 bilingual dictionaries, and showing that it confirms 147 out of 163 previous claims from the literature. We then identify previously unreported examples of lexical elaboration, and analyze how lexical elaboration is influenced by ecological and cultural variables. Claims about lexical elaboration are sometimes dismissed as either obvious or fanciful, but our work suggests that large-scale computational approaches to the topic can produce nonobvious and well-grounded insights into language and culture.\n\nSome highlights from the two journalistic articles cited above:\n\nLanguages are windows into the worlds of the people who speak them – reflecting what they value and experience daily.\n\nSo perhaps it’s no surprise different languages highlight different areas of vocabulary. Scholars have noted that Mongolian has many horse-related words, that Maori has many words for ferns, and Japanese has many words related to taste.\n\nSome links are unsurprising, such as German having many words related to beer, or Fijian having many words for fish. The linguist Paul Zinsli wrote an entire book on Swiss-German words related to mountains.\n\n…\n\nOne example of a concept we looked at was “horse”, for which the top-scoring languages included French, German, Kazakh and Mongolian. This means dictionaries in these languages had a relatively high number of\n\nwords for horses. For instance, Mongolian аргамаг means “a good racing or riding horse” words related to horses. For instance, Mongolian чөдөрлөх means “to hobble a horse”.\n\n…\n\nOur findings support most links previously highlighted by researchers, including that Hindi has many words related to love and Japanese has many words related to obligation and duty.\n\nWe were especially interested in testing the idea that Inuit languages have many words for snow. This notorious claim has long been distorted and exaggerated. It has even been dismissed as the “great Eskimo vocabulary hoax”, with some experts saying it simply isn’t true.\n\nBut our results suggest the Inuit snow vocabulary is indeed exceptional. Out of 616 languages, the language with the top score for “snow” was Eastern Canadian Inuktitut. The other two Inuit languages in our data set (Western Canadian Inuktitut and North Alaskan Inupiatun) also achieved high scores for “snow”.\n\nThe Eastern Canadian Inuktitut dictionary in our dataset includes terms such as kikalukpok, which means “noisy walking on hard snow”, and apingaut, which means “first snow fall”.\n\nThe top 20 languages for “snow” included several other languages of Alaska, such as Ahtena, Dena'ina and Central Alaskan Yupik, as well as Japanese and Scots.\n\nScots includes terms such as doon-lay, meaning “a heavy fall of snow”, feughter meaning “a sudden, slight fall of snow”, and fuddum, meaning “snow drifting at intervals”.\n\nYou can explore our findings using the tool we developed, which allows you to identify the top languages for any given concept, and the top concepts for a particular language.\n\n…\n\nThe top-scoring languages for “smell” include a cluster of Oceanic languages such as Marshallese, which has terms such as jatbo meaning “smell of damp clothing”, meļļā meaning “smell of blood”, and aelel meaning “smell of fish, lingering on hands, body, or utensils”.\n\nPrior to our research, the smell terms of the Pacific Islands had received little attention.\n\nMuch to their credit, the authors are careful to issue a set of thoughtful caveats:\n\nAlthough our analysis reveals many interesting links between languages and concepts, the results aren’t always reliable – and should be checked against original dictionaries where possible.\n\nFor example, the top concepts for Plautdietsch (Mennonite Low German) include von (“of”), den (“the”) and und (“and”) – all of which are unrevealing. We excluded similar words from other languages using Wiktionary, but our method did not filter out these common words for Plautdietsch.\n\nAlso, the word counts reflect both dictionary definitions and other elements, such as example sentences. While our analysis excluded words that are especially likely to appear in example sentences (such as “woman” and “father”), such words could have still influenced our results to some extent.\n\nMost importantly, our results run the risk of perpetuating potentially harmful stereotypes if taken at face value. So we urge caution and respect while using the tool. The concepts it lists for any given language provide, at best, a crude reflection of the cultures associated with that language.\n\nTo conclude, one of my favorite Mongolian words is Morin Khuur (Mongolian: Морин хуур), which may be translated as \"horse fiddle\".\n\nThe full Classical Mongolian name is Morin Tologhay'ta Quğur (Морин толгойтой хуур), meaning \"fiddle with a horse's head\".\n\nSee \"Some Mongolian words for 'horse'\" (11/7/19), a variorum post with observations and comments by more than two dozen specialists.\n\nSelected readings\n\nThe claim that Eskimo words for snow are unusually numerous, particularly in contrast to English, is a cliché commonly used to support the controversial linguistic relativity hypothesis. In linguistic terminology, the relevant languages are the Eskimo–Aleut languages, specifically the Yupik and Inuit varieties.\n\nThe strongest interpretation of the linguistic relativity hypothesis, also known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis or \"Whorfianism\", posits that a language's vocabulary (among other features) shapes or limits its speakers' view of the world. This interpretation is widely criticized by linguists, though a 2010 study supports the core notion that the Yupik and Inuit languages have many more root words for frozen variants of water than the English language. The original claim is loosely based in the work of anthropologist Franz Boas and was particularly promoted by his contemporary, Benjamin Lee Whorf, whose name is connected with the hypothesis.[4][5] The idea is commonly tied to larger discussions on the connections between language and thought.\n\nFranz Boas did not make quantitative claims but rather pointed out that the Eskaleut languages have about the same number of distinct word roots referring to snow as English does, with the structure of these languages tending to allow more variety as to how those roots can be modified in forming a single word. A good deal of the ongoing debate thus depends on how one defines \"word\", and perhaps even \"word root\".\n\nThe first re-evaluation of the claim was by linguist Laura Martin in 1986, who traced the history of the claim and argued that its prevalence had diverted attention from serious research into linguistic relativity. A subsequent influential and humorous, and polemical, essay by Geoffrey K. Pullum repeated Martin's critique, calling the process by which the so-called \"myth\" was created the \"Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax\". Pullum argued that the fact that the number of word roots for snow is about equally large in Eskimoan languages and English indicates that there exists no difference in the size of their respective vocabularies to define snow. Other specialists in the matter of Eskimoan languages and Eskimoan knowledge of snow and especially sea ice argue against this notion and defend Boas's original fieldwork amongst the Inuit, at the time known as Eskimo, of Baffin Island.\n\n[Thanks to Hiroshi Kumamoto and Ross Presser]\n\nPermalink"}

Moves into nurture, where your B2B prospects typically perform months of extensive product research via traditional searches and AI results before a sale is closed.\n\nThe fact that informative content is found on SERPs is due to SEO.\n\nBut how is this tracked? How do you know which non-conversion pages are:\n\nPart of the user journey?\n\nPart of the overall ROI?\n\nHow Do I Tie SEO To Company Revenue?\n\nLuckily, your C-suite likely recognizes the need for SEO content.\n\nThey are prepared to invest in a strategy incorporating AI search.\n\nHowever, you need tools that validate the investment and clearly showcase it for your higher-ups.\n\nHow To Keep Revenue High When SERPs Are Changing\n\nGartner predicts that traditional search engine volume will drop 25% by 2026 and flow directly to AI chatbots and agents.\n\nAs AI continues to accelerate the evolution of SEO, it’s critical to ensure that high-performing pages:\n\nContinue to rank in traditional SERPs.\n\nAppear in Google’s AI overviews.\n\nGet referenced by the Gen AI tools your audience relies on.\n\nThey are tracked, so these visits are attributed to a sale.\n\nThat’s why you need to understand why certain content is picked up by AI tools and the cost of generating the content to calculate the true ROI of your SEO.\n\nStep 1. How To Create Content That Gets Seen In Traditional Search & AI Overviews\n\nWith the shift in consumer search behavior, your first step is to create, optimize, and measure the ROI of content sourced by leading AI tools.\n\nThat means appearing in AI Overviews and AI Answers that contain list-based content and product comparisons.\n\nSearch Your Brand & See What Each AI Tool Recommends\n\nThat’s the first step to determining whether your content or your competitor’s stands out.\n\nGive these prompts a try:\n\nWhat is the best solution for…\n\nGive me the top tools for…\n\nBest alternative to…\n\nIs [competitor] solution better than…\n\nOptimize Your Existing Content & Strategy To Feed AI’s Answer Base\n\nThe next step is optimizing existing content and adjusting your strategy so that you write copy that gives AI the answers it’s looking for.\n\nWith that said, following traditional SEO strategies and best practices championed by Google should help.\n\nJust like traditional search, AI tools also favor:\n\nProper site and article structure with explicit metadata and semantic markup.\n\nContent with lists and bullet points that are easier to scan.\n\nWebsites optimized for speed.\n\nUpdated content, keeping things fresh with context.\n\nContent with backlinks from high-quality publications.\n\nFAQ sections.\n\nMobile-responsive websites with indexable content when pulling sources to provide an answer.\n\nThese factors give your content more authority in your industry, just like the content outside your website that Google and LLMs look for to find answers from, such as videos on YouTube, reviews on G2, and conversations on Reddit forums.\n\nPublishing enough quality content for all those channels to optimize for AI and be visible in traditional search is no small task. It requires substantial human resources, SEO tools, and time.\n\nStep 2. Understand All Aspects Of The Real Cost Of SEO Content In 2025\n\nSEO is a long game, especially in B2B, where the path from first click to purchase can span weeks or months and involve multiple touchpoints.\n\nAnd now, with AI influencing how content is discovered, the cost of doing SEO well has increased.\n\nTo accurately assess the cost of SEO-driven content in 2025, you need to go beyond production budgets and organic traffic. Here’s how:\n\nBreak Down Your True SEO Investment\n\nStart by identifying all the resources that go into content creation and maintenance:\n\nPeople: Writers, designers, SEOs, developers, and editors.\n\nTools: SEO platforms, content optimization tools, keyword research databases, analytics software.\n\nDistribution: Paid support for SEO content, social promotion, and email newsletters.\n\nMaintenance: Refreshing old content, updating links, and improving page experience.\n\nMonitor Content Performance Over Time\n\nTrack the performance of each piece of content using more than just rankings:\n\nOrganic traffic (from both traditional search and AI surfaces).\n\nTime on page and engagement metrics.\n\nCost per lead and pipeline contribution (if possible).\n\nAssisted conversions across all touchpoints.\n\nMap Content to Buyer Journey Stages\n\nContent doesn’t just convert, it nurtures. Tie content assets to specific stages:\n\nTop-of-funnel (education, discovery).\n\nMid-funnel (comparison, product evaluation).\n\nBottom-of-funnel (case studies, demos).\n\nEven if content isn’t the final touchpoint, it plays a role. Traditional tools miss this.\n\nAdjust, Monitor & Pivot\n\nNo single metric will tell the full story. Instead:\n\nAdjust: Re-optimize content based on AI overview visibility, CTR, and engagement.\n\nMonitor: Watch how users arrive from search vs. AI sources.\n\nPivot: Invest more in formats and topics that show traction across both human and AI audiences.\n\nWithout full-funnel attribution, even the most engaged content may look like a cost center instead of a revenue driver.\n\nThat’s why accurate measurement, aligned with total investment and the full buyer journey, is critical to understanding the real ROI of your SEO content in 2025.\n\nHowever, we know that:\n\nAI Overviews and similar answer engines also play a big role in education and nurturing.\n\nAttributing a sale to content read on an untrackable AI Overview is impossible, but it’s happening.\n\nThis is where the calculation gets difficult.\n\nStep 3. Incorporate Multi-Touch Attribution To Your Revenue Calculations\n\nNow that we’re here, you’re beginning to understand how tricky it is to tie ROI to AI Overview responses that nurture your prospects.\n\nHow do you accurately determine the cost?\n\nSome people are creating their own attribution models to calculate ROI.\n\nMost people are using tools that are built specifically for this new calculation.\n\nThe only way to accurately calculate cost in B2B SEO is to capture the engagement with content throughout the buyer journey, which conventional attribution models don’t credit.\n\nIncorporate These Blindspots: Pre-Acquisition & The Post-Lead Journey\n\nAnother substantial blind spot in SEO measurement occurs when companies focus exclusively on pre-acquisition activities, meaning everything that happens before a lead is added to your CRM.\n\nConsider the typical journey enterprise clients take in an account-based marketing approach:\n\nAfter multiple organic searches, a prospect converts into a lead from direct traffic. After being qualified as an SQL, they’re included in an email sequence that they never respond to, but return through a Google Ads campaign promoting a white paper. They download it from an organic search visit and continue reading more blog articles to understand your product and the outcomes they hope to achieve.\n\nCan your marketing team track how each channel (direct, paid search, and organic) influenced the deal throughout the sales process?\n\nMultitouch attribution tools allow marketers to finally link SEO content to tangible business outcomes by tracking what SEO-driven content leads interacted with before a sale.\n\nHeeet Makes SEO ROI Calculations Easy\n\nAfter years of wrestling with these challenges, we built Heeet to fill the void: an end-to-end attribution solution that connects SEO efforts and interactions generated from content marketing to revenue by highlighting their impact throughout the sales cycle within Salesforce.\n\nOur proprietary cookieless tracking solution collects more data, ensuring your decisions are based on complete, unbiased insights rather than partial or skewed information.\n\nTraditional SEO measurement often relies on first-click or last-click attribution, which fails to capture SEO’s entire influence on revenue. Heeet places SEO on a level playing field by providing full-funnel attribution that tracks SEO’s impact at every customer journey stage.\n\nWe help marketers determine whether SEO-driven content is the first touchpoint, one of the many intermediary interactions along the lengthy B2B sales cycle, or the final conversion leading to a sale to pinpoint SEO’s cumulative influence on your pipeline.\n\nHeeet actively tracks every touchpoint, ensuring that the actual impact of SEO is neither underestimated nor misrepresented.\n\nRather than neglecting SEO’s role when a prospect converts through another channel, Heeet delivers a complete view of how different personas in the buying committee interact with each piece of content and where they’re converting. This empowers businesses to make informed, data-driven SEO strategies and investment decisions.\n\nMeasuring ROI is non-negotiable and hinges on precise revenue tracking and a thorough understanding of costs.

There was a link between victims and an alleged attacker\n\ntoggle caption John Minchillo/AP/AP\n\nFor years, the U.S. Justice Department has worked to unravel a global hacking campaign that targeted prominent American climate activists. Now, public tax filings reviewed by NPR reveal an unexpected link between the company that allegedly commissioned the attacks and some of the victims.\n\nThe connection emerges as another element in the complex story of how hackers were allegedly hired to attack parts of American civil society. The Justice Department investigation has focused recently on an Israeli private investigator named Amit Forlit whom federal prosecutors are trying to extradite from the United Kingdom for allegedly orchestrating the hacking. Prosecutors say the operation was aimed at gathering information to foil lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry over damage communities have faced from climate change.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBuried in the investigation's court filings are the names of one of the world's biggest publicly-traded oil companies and one of its longtime lobbyists: ExxonMobil and DCI Group. In an affidavit filed in the UK, a federal prosecutor identifies DCI as the firm that allegedly commissioned the hacking.\n\nDCI was working for ExxonMobil when the attacks allegedly started around early 2016, according to federal lobbying records and Justice Department legal filings. At the same time, DCI was also consulting for New Venture Fund, a nonprofit known for working on progressive causes, including reducing the use of fossil fuels, according to tax filings NPR reviewed. During that period when DCI worked for both ExxonMobil and New Venture Fund, a senior advisor at the nonprofit was working with climate activists targeted by the alleged hacking operation.\n\nLegal experts and researchers who track Washington's influence industry told NPR the relationship between DCI and New Venture Fund raises questions about what role that connection might have played in the alleged targeting of climate activists. Analysts at The Citizen Lab, a cyber watchdog at the University of Toronto, said in a report about the attacks that they were carefully tailored, suggesting hackers had a \"highly detailed and accurate understanding\" of the climate activists and their relationships.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"What you have unearthed is certainly a step investigators would want to look at,\" Barbara McQuade, a law professor at the University of Michigan and a former federal prosecutor, told NPR about the link between DCI and New Venture Fund.\n\nIn criminal cases, investigators map out relationships between individuals and organizations using things like financial transactions, phone records and tax filings, McQuade says. \"When you layer them along with dates, sometimes you can find interesting patterns,\" she says.\n\nThe Justice Department didn't respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nA DCI executive, Craig Stevens, declined to comment. Stevens previously told NPR that no one at the firm has been questioned by the U.S. government as part of the hacking investigation. \"Allegations of DCI's involvement with hacking supposedly occurring nearly a decade ago are false and unsubstantiated. We direct all our employees and consultants to comply with the law,\" Stevens said. \"Meanwhile, radical anti-oil activists and their donors are peddling conspiracy theories to distract from their own anti-U.S. energy activities.\"\n\nExxonMobil referred to a previous statement in which the company told NPR it has not been \"involved in, nor are we aware of, any hacking activities. If there was any hacking involved, we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\" The company has said it has repeatedly acknowledged \"climate change is real, and we have an entire business dedicated to reducing emissions.\"\n\nNew Venture Fund President Lee Bodner told NPR that DCI worked on a project housed at the nonprofit that promoted education reform and Common Core state education standards with Republicans. Bodner says DCI wouldn't have had access to New Venture Fund's internal computer systems.\n\ntoggle caption ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n\nHacking victim says the attacks felt like 'Big Brother had arrived'\n\nThe hacking operation against climate activists fits a widespread pattern in which companies and wealthy individuals use private investigators to conduct cyberespionage against opponents, often to discredit them in legal disputes.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs part of the Justice Department's long-running investigation into the hacking, an Israeli private investigator named Aviram Azari was sentenced to prison in the U.S. in late 2023 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit computer hacking, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Azari hired hackers who targeted American climate activists, as well as government officials in Africa, members of a Mexican political party and critics of a German company called Wirecard, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nIn a sentencing memo for Azari, prosecutors singled out ExxonMobil, saying the company used news stories based on information stolen from activists as part of its defense against state climate investigations. Prosecutors didn't accuse ExxonMobil or DCI of wrongdoing in that case.\n\n\"It felt like Big Brother had arrived,\" and \"citizens opposing powerful interests have their communications surveilled,\" Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family Fund, said at Azari's 2023 sentencing hearing in Manhattan. Wasserman was among those targeted by the hacking.\n\nMonths later, in early 2024, Amit Forlit, a business associate of Azari's, was arrested under an Interpol Red Notice at London's Heathrow airport on his way to Tel Aviv. The Justice Department has charged Forlit with conspiracy to commit computer hacking, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. Forlit has previously denied ordering or paying for hacking.\n\nA former officer in Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, Forlit said in a sworn statement after his arrest that he owns a security and intelligence-gathering firm whose clients include law firms, lobbyists and hedge funds. Another hearing in Forlit's extradition case is scheduled for April 17 in London.\n\nA lawyer for Forlit said in a recent court filing that the hacking operation her client is accused of leading \"is alleged to have been commissioned by DCI Group, a lobbying firm representing ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest fossil fuel companies.\"\n\ntoggle caption Alberto Pezzali/AP/AP\n\nPrivate eye's lawyer says U.S. hacking charges are part of an attack on ExxonMobil\n\nThe British judge overseeing Forlit's extradition case recently unsealed the U.S. indictment against him. In it, the names of the oil and gas company and the lobbying firm Forlit allegedly worked for are anonymized. Instead, the indictment refers to a \"public affairs, lobbying, and business consulting company, headquartered in Washington, D.C.,\" that allegedly hired Forlit to target environmental activists as part of its work for \"one of the world's largest oil and gas corporations, with headquarters in Irving, Texas.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHowever, an affidavit that a Justice Department prosecutor filed in support of the U.S. extradition request fails to anonymize the \"D.C. lobbying firm\" in one part of the document. About halfway through the 30-page affidavit, the prosecutor cites emails in which \"DCI Group\" employees allegedly shared versions of a stolen memo belonging to an environmental lawyer, as well as information about people who received the memo.\n\nNPR couldn't confirm that the Justice Department is referring to DCI every time the affidavit mentions the \"D.C. lobbying firm.\" However, the Justice Department only cites one lobbying firm in the affidavit.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, the \"D.C. lobbying firm\" started working with Forlit at least as far back as 2013.\n\nIn 2015, an executive at the D.C. lobbying firm allegedly approached Forlit about targeting environmental and climate advocates, according to the affidavit. The affidavit details how the Justice Department alleges the hacking operation worked:\n\nThe D.C. lobbying firm allegedly identified people and organizations it wanted to discredit as part of its work for the Texas oil company;\n\nForlit or a co-conspirator allegedly gave Azari lists of people or accounts that were of interest to the D.C. lobbying firm;\n\nAzari then allegedly hired hackers to target the climate activists;\n\nLater, the lobbying firm allegedly shared with the oil company private documents — or versions of documents — that were \"likely obtained through the successful hacking,\" according to the prosecutor's affidavit.\n\nSoon after, the private documents appeared in media reports that were \"designed to undermine the integrity of the civil investigations\" into the oil company, the Justice Department alleges. The affidavit claims the oil company then \"relied on the published articles about the stolen and leaked documents\" in court filings to fight litigation.\n\nDCI lobbied for ExxonMobil for about a decade, according to federal lobbying records . ExxonMobil was based in Irving, Texas , until mid-2023. Forlit's lawyer, Rachel Scott, said in a January court filing in London that the U.S. is trying to prosecute Forlit in part \"to advance the politically-motivated cause of pursuing ExxonMobil.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nExxonMobil and other fossil-fuel companies face dozens of climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. The lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The U.S. government is not part of the litigation. The fossil fuel industry says the lawsuits are meritless and politicized, and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.\n\ntoggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP/AP\n\nA private meeting among climate activists gets exposed in the press\n\nIn the affidavit, the Justice Department said the first example of alleged hacking of documents and leaking to the media came in 2016.\n\nEarly that year, Kenny Bruno, an environmental advocate, emailed an agenda for a closed-door strategy meeting to a group of climate activists. They planned to gather at the Manhattan office of the Rockefeller Family Fund, a philanthropy that supports initiatives to address climate change, inequality and threats to democracy. At the time, the fossil-fuel industry was under growing pressure as Democratic politicians urged the Justice Department to investigate whether ExxonMobil had misled the public about climate change. Climate activists were to meet at the Rockefeller office to hone their attacks on the company, according to the meeting agenda .\n\nWhen Bruno emailed the agenda in January 2016, he and DCI were both working with the non-profit New Venture Fund, NPR has found in tax filings and documents related to the U.S. hacking investigation. The prosecutor's affidavit says that about a month after Bruno sent the email, around February 2016, an executive at the D.C. lobbying firm gave copies of the email to the firm's client, the unnamed Texas oil company.\n\nNPR hasn't been able to find any evidence of how the D.C. lobbying firm allegedly got copies of the email with the agenda. Forlit's team was also asked around that time to dig up information about the activists who received Bruno's email, according to the Justice Department affidavit.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe agenda for the Rockefeller meeting then surfaced in media reports in April 2016. ExxonMobil and Republican lawmakers cited the document as they battled state climate investigations, saying activists and state prosecutors colluded to advance a political agenda.\n\nBruno says he didn't know DCI was a consultant for New Venture Fund at the same time he was there. He says he was working on a project housed at the nonprofit to limit oil production from Canadian tar sands . \"I had no interaction with them,\" he says.\n\n\"If DCI was involved, they wouldn't have [had] access through their work with New Venture Fund,\" says Bodner, the nonprofit's president. Bodner adds: \"Our [computer] systems didn't house that kind of sensitive project communication that would have been of most interest to the hackers.\"\n\nAs a so-called fiscal sponsor , New Venture Fund provides administrative, legal and accounting support for the projects that it hosts. New Venture Fund was the fiscal sponsor for the projects that Bruno and DCI, respectively, were working on when climate activists were targeted by hackers.\n\nThe leak of the Rockefeller agenda wasn't the only time private communications between environmental advocates appeared in the media in an apparent effort to shape public opinion.\n\nIn another example cited by the Justice Department, the D.C. lobbying firm allegedly obtained a private memo belonging to an environmental lawyer as early as March 2016. Around that time, an executive at the lobbying firm gave a copy of the document to the oil company, according to the prosecutor's affidavit.\n\nIt's in this portion of the affidavit where the anonymization of the D.C. lobbying firm lapses. The affidavit states that a version of the private memo was then emailed between \"DCI Group\" employees shortly before it was published in a news report in 2017. On the day the article was published, an executive at the D.C. lobbying firm emailed it to colleagues, the prosecutor's affidavit against Forlit alleges. The subject line of the email was \"BOOM.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhen the FBI interviewed Forlit a few years later, in the U.S. Embassy in London in 2021, they discussed his \"connections with DCI,\" Forlit said in a sworn statement that was filed as part of his extradition case.\n\nKert Davies, director of special investigations at the Center for Climate Integrity and a target of the hacking, says DCI was instrumental in public relations work that helped ExxonMobil and others in the fossil-fuel industry fight efforts to cut heat-trapping emissions while politicizing the issue of climate change among voters.\n\nThe industry \"sought division and debate to slow the policy wheel from turning,\" Davies says.\n\ntoggle caption Jae C. Hong/AP/AP\n\nDCI executive said the firm is hired 'when the stakes are the highest'\n\nAnalysts at The Citizen Lab, the cyber watchdog group, said in a report several years ago that the attacks on climate activists were \"well-informed.\" Hackers targeted campaigners and their family members with what are known as \"phishing emails,\" which are used to gain access to sensitive information through impersonation or other deceptive means. Some of the messages seemed to refer to confidential documents related to ExxonMobil, The Citizen Lab said, while others impersonated people who were involved in lawsuits against the oil company.\n\nThat suggests hackers \"had a deep knowledge of informal organizational hierarchies\" among the climate activists, The Citizen Lab said. \"Some of this knowledge would likely have been hard to obtain from [publicly-available information] alone.\"\n\nThe Citizen Lab report didn't mention Forlit or DCI, and it didn't draw conclusions about who may have commissioned the hacking. NPR hasn't been able to find evidence that DCI obtained any non-public information about climate activists through its work with New Venture Fund.\n\nDCI has longstanding ties to the fossil fuel industry. In the early 2000s, ExxonMobil provided funding for a website DCI published called Tech Central Station, which the Union of Concerned Scientists called a \"hybrid of quasi-journalism and lobbying.\" And from 2005 until early 2016, ExxonMobil paid DCI around $3 million to lobby the federal government, according to lobbying disclosures. DCI has also worked for a nonprofit that supports the U.S. coal industry, and another that launched a campaign in 2017 to push back on climate lawsuits targeting the fossil fuel industry.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn a post on the social media site X in March, a DCI executive, Justin Peterson, denied orchestrating the hacking campaign against climate activists. DCI \"is retained by our clients when the stakes are the highest,\" the post says. \"We are aggressive and we play to win. But we follow the law.\""}

Zero typical RV connections, we boondock exclusively… a perpetual pre-SHTF form of post-SHTF practicing. 2003, we engineered our rig with the least possible things to go wrong. Our focus was ‘primitive’. We generally hit the sack around sundown. Never saw any benefits to association with that carnsnarggled late-night crowd. Equipment: For lights, we use Black & Decker 20VDC tool battery-operated square-base flashlights . Some of our batteries are factory-marked 2012, and they are still going strong. A full battery probably lasts at least four hours, but we never tested their duration. We might need a focused localized light for maybe a couple minutes, but then, once again, we embrace the night. We have five near the entry plus two each side of the bed. We have a couple of them in each truck plus an inverter and charger with spare batteries. During all that time, only one battery failed. I acquired new cells from our local-owned family-operated electronics shop, and re-built it in ten minutes (six of those minutes were spent warming the soldering iron…) Would I acquire them again?

Kerosene mantle lamps, the best known of which is the Aladdin lamp, were a common fixture in American homes in the first half of the 20th century before high-line electrification, and are commonly used by the Amish today. They have a cylindrical wick that heats a conical mantle. They are much more efficient than a conventional “hurricane” lamp, and produce a whiter, brighter light than a non-mantle lamp. They have no noticeable smell and are a great source of heat too. I have several, both at my home and at my BOL. A table model in the middle of your kitchen table for eating, and a floor model next to the couch for relaxing and reading will go a long way toward meeting your lighting needs. Their downside is fragility, because they have a delicate mantle in them. You are not going to want to carry these around. You will still want a conventional wicked lantern like a Dietz for portable lighting, especially for outside. For stationary use, however, the Aladdin lamp is much better.”\n\no o o\n\nReader 3AD Scout wrote us:\n\n“I’ve been thinking about the trade war with China and I can’t shake my gut feeling that this trade war is a prelude to something more sinister. I have done a lot of research about the U.S. defense production act and other mechanisms/laws that have been put in place over the years, mainly after each war we fought. Go back to pre-World War One and Two. The U.S. was very isolationist, at least the public and many of the politicians. The powers that be knew that war was inevitable and also knew the U.S. was not ready for war. Trying to get Congress to pass legislation to get the U.S. prepared for war was difficult, hence why we have the Defense Production Act. Know the President has authority and resources to quickly spin things up without Congressional approval. So the President has the authority but that doesn’t mean that he/we have the manufacturing means. We also know that the global trade and global supply chains are not conducive to a war-fighting machine. So how does the U.S. re-shape its economy today to prepare for war? Enter the trade war. The last steel mill built in the U.S. was in 1964, now we have one being built by Hyundai. We see a huge effort to have the newest microchips manufactured here in the U.S. A trade war with China will see some re-shoring of manufacturing but not the vast majority. I suspect we will see a lot of the manufacturing move from China to India. Just makes sense considering that India has a huge labor pool and cheap labor too. The populations of China and India are roughly the same. When shooting wars start we know that global shipping gets targeted, just as Germany targeted ships carrying American arms and munitions to Europe’s wars. Would China dare target ships/goods from India to the U.S.? India is a historic adversary of China and is also nuclear-armed. That becomes a huge problem for China to have to navigate. We basically make India a de facto ally. I also find it interesting that our current VP is married to a person of Indian heritage. So my thought is that this “trade war” is really a prelude war.”\n\nPlease Send Us Your Snippets!\n\nPlease send your snippet items for potential posting to JWR. or AVL.

These included: making or supplying articles for use in frauds; encouraging or assisting the commission of an offense believing it would be committed; and transferring criminal property.\n\nAccording to the Metropolitan Police, Coyne’s website, LabHost, was used by over 2000 fraudsters to create phishing sites designed to trick victims into handing over their personal and financial information and log-ins.\n\nIn operation from 2021 to 2024, LabHost charged would-be phishers a membership fee, which provided them with access to pre-built phishing templates or the ability to request bespoke pages spoofing trusted brands including banks, healthcare providers and postal services.\n\nRead more on phishing-as-a-service: Morphing Meerkat PhaaS Platform Spoofs 100+ Brands\n\nThomas Short, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), claimed that the platform enabled mass global fraud campaigns “resulting in losses totalling more than £100m.”\n\nThat’s 100 times more than was originally reported by the Met, which last year claimed the platform was responsible for 40,000 phishing sites, 70,000 UK victims, and the theft of 480,000 card numbers, 64,000 PIN numbers and over one million passwords.\n\nLabHost was finally taken down in April 2024 after a coordinated operation from the Met’s Cyber Crime Unit, the National Crime Agency (NCA), Microsoft, Europol and other partners.\n\nThat month, the Met arrested 24 suspects, many of whom were LabHost users, and searched over 70 addresses.\n\n“The outcome of this case demonstrates the unwavering commitment of the Met in pursuing individuals like Coyne who mastermind a network of fraudulent activity, which ultimately brings misery to thousands of innocent people,” said commander Stephen Clayman, head of the Met’s Central Specialist Crime team.\n\n“This also demonstrates the commitment across law enforcement to identify and hold those to account who facilitate criminal enabling functions and think they can remain undetected. We will find you and take action.”\n\nPhishing Fuels Fraud\n\nHowever, the reality is that the advantage still lies with the perpetrators of phishing and other digital fraud-related threats, who remain largely anonymous.\n\nFraud is now the most common crime type in the UK, with four-fifths being cyber-enabled.\n\nThe government’s fraud prevention strategy, which is still being finalized, is set to revolve around the use of emerging technologies, more process automation to free up investigators, improved data sharing and international cooperation."}

U.S. petrochemicals, particularly polyethylene and PVC, also rely heavily on exports.\n\nThe sector’s primary challenge is lower demand and pricing, rather than cost inflation, the analysts wrote, adding that energy cost relief offers some buffer, though inflation remains a risk for coatings firms.\n\nBofA is more constructive on agriculture stocks, where the cycle may be at or near a trough.\n\n\n\nIt sees relatively limited macro impact given companies’ global footprints, though U.S. farm incomes remain vulnerable to crop tariffs.\n\n\n\nThe firm struck a cautious tone on commodity chemicals, despite steep stock declines, and flagged a weakening outlook for clean hydrogen and coatings.\n\nBofA’s top picks include industrial gas giant Linde (NYSE:LIN), ag firms Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) and Mosaic, and chemical names Eastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) and Westlake, all of which has strong balance sheets and company-specific growth drivers.\n\nRelated articles\n\nBofA downgrades U.S. chemical sector amid slowdown\n\nInteractive Brokers beats Q1 estimates on strong revenue growth\n\nWells Fargo turns more cautious on aerospace sector, cuts Hexcel, Howmet rating"}

The technique works well if the cells only need to be observed for a few hours, but it breaks down for longer times, as photons from the light source eventually damage the cells. Ultrasound imaging allows for longer viewing times—24 hours or more—but its long wavelength, which can’t be shorter than a few hundred micrometers, leads to a resolution that is typically too low to be useful. Now Hirotsugu Ogi of the University of Osaka, Japan, and colleagues have demonstrated an artificial-intelligence (AI)-based method that can give low-resolution images of cells a high-resolution makeover [1]. Ogi expects that their method could improve the resolution of other types of microscopes.\n\nFor their demonstration the researchers collected more than 100,000 ultrasound and optical images of the same live stem cells. The images were then fed into an AI algorithm, which was trained to learn the relationship between the features of the two sets of images. The team then tested the algorithm with a new set of ultrasound images of cells and found that the output images matched the optical images of those cells. Ogi says that the key to the success was including both low- and high-frequency acoustic signals in the images. The low-frequency data capture mechanical resonances of the cell nucleus, which turned out to be needed to train the AI algorithm correctly.\n\n–Katherine Wright\n\nKatherine Wright is the Deputy Editor of Physics Magazine.\n\nReferences et al., “Deep-learning generation of high-resolution images of live cells in culture using tri-frequency acoustic images,” N.

Over 130,000+ websites use aThemes’ WordPress themes and plugins to build an online presence, launch online stores, and grow revenue.\n\nIntroduction to aThemes – Quick Overview\n\naThemes offers professionally designed WordPress themes to help you quickly get your business online.\n\nThey are the company behind two popular WordPress themes, Sydney and Botiga. Both of them are rated 4.9 out of 5 on WordPress.org with an impressive 850+ 5-star reviews.\n\nLet’s take a detailed look.\n\nSydney is a great all-purpose free WordPress theme, used by over 100,000 websites. It offers tons of professionally designed starter site templates to help you quickly launch your website.\n\nAll you have to do is import a starter site and start customizing your website the way you want.\n\nOne of the best things about the Sydney theme is that it comes with an easy-to-use template builder, which transforms the way you build a website.\n\nFor example, you can replace theme-built components like header, footer, etc., on specific pages or everywhere.\n\nYou can also use the global template to create parts for all pages. Alternatively, you can create multiple templates and assign them to specific pages.\n\nTake a look at some other cool features of Sydney:\n\nCreate a highly customized header by choosing from 8 different header presets.\n\nQuickly customize your blog layout with its easy-to-use layout presets and flexible controls.\n\nEasily select a preset color palette that matches your brand. Or you can create your own from scratch.\n\nAdd as many sidebars as you want and control the display with conditions.\n\nAnd more…\n\nFeel free to download the free version of Sydney from WordPress.org.\n\nBotiga is a lightweight WooCommerce theme that is designed for optimal performance while boosting conversions.\n\nIt lets you easily showcase your eCommerce products and customize every part of your online store in real time. You can customize your product pages, checkout pages, and more.\n\nEasily Customize Your Product Pages\n\nOut of the box, it comes with three gallery styles for your product page to showcase your products.\n\nIt allows you to edit every aspect of your product card style, tweak the card layouts, and position add-to-cart buttons the way you want.\n\nYou can even create a fly-out mini cart to show cart details at a glance without interrupting your customers’ browsing experience.\n\nBoost Conversions on Your Checkout Pages\n\nDo you want to optimize your checkout page to boost conversions?\n\nBotiga allows you to display the total amount of the products on the right side or at the bottom of your cart and checkout pages.\n\nThat way, your customers can quickly review their order and find all relevant information easily.\n\nFeel free to download the free version of Botiga from WordPress.org.\n\nOther aThemes Products\n\nAside from WordPress themes, aThemes also offers two different WordPress plugins. They are:\n\naThemes Merchant\n\naThemes Merchant is an all-in-one WooCommerce growth tool that lets you increase revenue, retain customers, and boost AOV.\n\nWith Merchant, you can offer product bundles, frequently bought together products, bulk discounts, free gifts, and more.\n\naThemes Addons for Elementor\n\naThemes Addons brings together all the essential Elementor widgets you’ll need to create perfect websites.\n\nIt offers 55+ widgets, which can help you transform your Elementor workflow.\n\nBackground Story – Why aThemes?\n\nIn our annual WPBeginner reader survey, one of the user suggestions that we always get is to build a FREE WordPress theme that makes it easy to create stunning websites.\n\nNow, as you know, my focus has entirely been on building our WordPress plugins and software products, which are now used by over 30 million websites (thanks to your support). But I simply couldn’t ignore this request from the WPBeginner community.\n\nWhile we offer ThriveThemes (a premium suite of theme builder and WordPress growth plugins) and SeedProd AI theme builder (a premium tool that creates a site in seconds), we didn’t have a good free WordPress theme option.\n\nSo I started talking to some of my friends, and then Charlie Livingston, the founder of aThemes, reached out about potentially looking to exit the business. After a few short conversations, we signed the deal because it aligned with both of our visions.\n\nCharlie wanted the business to go in the hands of someone reputable and who has a proven track record of building great products.\n\nI knew our readers wanted us to build a free theme, and we had already been recommending the Sydney theme in our various articles because it’s a very high-quality theme.\n\nWhat’s Coming Next?\n\nOur work is just starting.\n\nMy goal is to create the best WordPress themes on the market while keeping them affordable and accessible to everyone. We have an exciting roadmap ahead that focuses on bringing premium-quality designs at a price point that makes sense for small business owners.\n\nIf you have suggestions on features you’d like to see in future theme releases, then please let us know by sending us a message via the WPBeginner contact form.\n\nAs always, I want to thank you for your continued support of WPBeginner.\n\nEvery time I share an announcement like this, I realize that I’m only able to do what I love every day because of you, our amazing readers, and I’m extremely grateful for your support throughout the years.\n\nWPBeginner and Awesome Motive would not be here without YOU, and I just want to say how much I appreciate all of you.\n\nAnd I look forward to continuing serving you, and the larger WordPress / web ecosystem for years to come.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nSyed Balkhi\n\nFounder of WPBeginner"}

Arsenal’s 1-1 home draw with Brentford meant that just nine points from their final seven fixtures would be enough to secure a historic 20th league championship.\n\nWest Ham arrived intent on frustrating the Reds and hitting on the counter. It was a strategy that caused discomfort at times, but Arne Slot’s men showed composure, resilience, and just enough cutting edge to grind out a critical victory.\n\nBelow is how the team lined up, with match details following.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/anfieldindex/status/1911726122636620075?s=46&t=rxgukmqdoXc4muVFLSx2EQ\n\nThe Starting Eleven\n\nGK – Alisson Becker\n\nRB – Conor Bradley\n\nRCB – Ibrahima Konaté\n\nLCB – Virgil van Dijk (c)\n\nLB – Kostas Tsimikas\n\nCM – Alexis Mac Allister\n\nACM – Curtis Jones\n\nCM – Ryan Gravenberch\n\nRF – Mohamed Salah\n\nCF – Diogo Jota\n\nLF – Luis Díaz\n\nSubs:\n\nAndy Robertson – Kostas Tsimikas (60 mins)\n\nCody Gakpo – Diogo Jota (60 mins)\n\nDominik Szoboszlai – Curtis Jones (68 mins)\n\nJarell Quansah – Conor Bradley (68 mins)\n\nWataru Endō – Mohamed Salah (84 min)\n\nGoals (Assisted by)\n\nLiverpool 1 – 0 West Ham\n\nLuis Díaz (Mohamed Salah) – 18 mins\n\nLiverpool 1 – 1 West Ham\n\nOwn Goal (Andy Robertson) – 66 mins\n\nLiverpool 2 – 1 West Ham\n\nVirgil van Dijk (Andy Robertson) – 72 mins\n\n🟥 Player Ratings – Liverpool 2-1 West Ham: Reds Grind Out Win in Tight Title Race ✍️ @StevLFChttps://t.co/Ad6U8LGx30 — AnfieldIndex (@AnfieldIndex) April 13, 2025\n\nImportant Match Stats\n\nPossession\n\nLiverpool 55% – 45% West Ham\n\nXG\n\nLiverpool 1.78 – 2.48 West Ham\n\nTotal Shots\n\nLiverpool 15 – 11 West Ham\n\nCorner Kicks\n\nLiverpool 10 – 3 West Ham\n\nOffsides\n\nLiverpool 5 – 4 West Ham\n\nFouls\n\nLiverpool 15 – 8 West Ham\n\nYellow Cards\n\nLiverpool 0 – 2 West Ham\n\nGoalkeeper Saves\n\nLiverpool 4 – 4 West Ham\n\nThe First Half\n\nLiverpool started on the front foot, dominating possession and looking sharper than in their defeat at Craven Cottage. The midfield trio of Mac Allister, Gravenberch, and Jones dictated the tempo early on, while the returning Alisson provided a reassuring presence behind the backline.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 18th minute. Mohamed Salah drifted inside from the right and slalomed past his marker before sliding a pass into Luis Díaz’s path. The Colombian forward timed his run perfectly and coolly slotted home to put Liverpool ahead.\n\nThough West Ham responded with a few dangerous moments on the break, Liverpool controlled the half, with Van Dijk and Konaté commanding in defence and Bradley offering energetic support from the right.\n\nIt would be later in the half that West Ham would start to offer more and more potency, which required Alisson Becker to make a super pair of saves to send his side into a fragile half-time lead.\n\nThe Second Half\n\nThe second half started with more balance, as West Ham grew in confidence and began to test Liverpool’s composure. Their persistence paid off in the 66th minute when Andy Robertson, trying to clear a dangerous cross shortly after coming on, inadvertently turned the ball into his net to level the game.\n\nIt was a setback—but one that drew a quick and decisive response. Just six minutes later, Robertson atoned for his error with a pinpoint corner that was met by the towering figure of Virgil van Dijk, who thundered home a header to restore Liverpool’s lead.\n\nSlot’s remaining substitutions did not manage the closing stages well and a late melee within the Liverpool box nearly saw the game drawn. West Ham pushed for another equaliser but were kept at bay by a relieved Liverpool side.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis was a gritty and important win. Not every performance can be dominant or fluid at this stage of a title race, and this one was about resilience as much as quality. Salah’s brilliance in the first half and Van Dijk’s leadership in the second proved the difference, alongside a ferocious performance of Alisson Becker.\n\nWhile West Ham made things difficult, Liverpool found the answers required and took another vital step toward lifting the Premier League trophy. With six games left, only two more wins are needed to make it official.\n\nNext up is a trip to Leicester City, where another massive three points will be the objective.\n\nSteven Smith’s Score Prediction:\n\nLiverpool 3 – 1 West Ham"}

The attention to detail we’ve come to know and love features on a lot of products sold through Donguri Kyowakoku, the studio’s affiliated retail chain, and one great example of that is on the My Neighbour Totoro Catbus Pendulum Clock.\n\nThere are loads of details here to fall in love with, starting with the beautifully crafted character body, which replicates the wide grin, giant eyes and many feet of the Catbus, as it huddles around a clock dial.\n\n▼ Plus, there’s the destination display, which reads “じかん” (“jikan” [“time”]).\n\nThe clock dial stands out with its bright red, blue and yellow hues, but look closer and you’ll see an acorn and three Totoros hidden inside, spelling out the letters “GBL”.\n\nGBL is the studio’s “American casual style” brand under which this clock has been produced. Known for skateboards, Hawaiian shirts and other fashionable items marketed towards adults rather than children, the Catbus is geared towards an older market consisting of people who won’t be scared off by the character’s giant eyes.\n\nWhile the Catbus’ eyes aren’t entirely frightening in the movie, here they might be a little unsettling for children, because they move from left to right with every passing second.\n\n▼ Plus, the tail moves from left to right too.\n\nWith the constant movement, this clock might be better suited to your living quarters rather than your bedroom, but for lovers of the magical feline, it’s an interior feature that you won’t want to miss out on. After selling out following its debut in 2022, it’s back in stock at GBL and Donguri Kyowakoku stores and online, priced at 12,100 yen (US$83.14).\n\nSource, images: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

In the past few months alone, we’ve seen the fast food chain produce promotional toys for fans of Pokémon, Doraemon, and Evangelion. Now McDonald’s is getting set for its latest anime-themed Happy Meals, featuring the characters of Chiikawa.\n\nChiikawa’s popularity hasn’t dipped at all since winning the Japan Character Award in 2022, and so the Happy Meal toys are sure to be in high demand when they appear next month. In addition to titular main character Chiikawa, friends such as Hachiware, Usagi, and Momonga are also part of the lineup, with the whole crew dressed in cute but snappy McDonald’s employee uniforms. Each of the toys looks to have some sort of functionality or play gimmick, like the French fry figure doubling as a tape measure or the car being a wind-up toy that can scoot forward.\n\nMany fast food chains in Japan have taken to releasing promotional giveaway items in stages, hoping to alleviate the entire stock getting snatched up by resellers on the very first day. The announcement from the official McDonald’s Japan Twitter account confirms that will be the case with its Chiikawa Happy Meals, with the eight items split up into two rounds of four possible toys each. Only one date has been announced yet, though, May 16, which would seem to indicate the first round, and odds are the second round will be released sometime later that month.\n\nSource: Twitter/@McDonaldsJapan via Nijimen\n\nTop image: Twitter/@McDonaldsJapan\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

Carr told Live Science in an email that the situation was \"dispiriting and exasperating\" and noted that the ownership of juvenile and subadult specimens was especially worrisome.\n\n\"The early growth stages of T. rex are bedeviled by a poor fossil record, and so the loss of them carries the heaviest scientific cost,\" Carr said. \"At the current moment, our knowledge of one of the most basic aspects of T. rex biology is frustratingly compromised by market interests.\"\n\nCarr published his findings, titled \"Tyrannosaurus rex: An endangered species,\" on April 10 in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica .\n\nRelated: Did The Rock buy Stan, the most expensive Tyrannosaurus rex on record?\n\nTo better understand the private market's impact on the number of T. rex fossils available to researchers, Carr targeted what he described as \"scientifically informative\" specimens — skulls, skeletons and isolated bones that researchers would include in studies of T. rex development and variation.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nCarr counted the \"informative\" specimens in public and private ownership by scouring books, museum records, news articles, auction records, anecdotal reports and other sources. He found a total of 61 specimens in public trusts and 71 specimens, including 14 juveniles, in private ownership — likely an underestimate given \"the secretive nature\" of the private market and year-to-year discovery of new specimens, according to the study.\n\nCommercially sourced specimens sometimes end up in public museums , either on loan or after being purchased by the museum. But Carr found that only 11% of the commercially harvested T. rex fossils end up in public trusts, and that commercial companies are now discovering twice as many T. rex fossils as museums.\n\nCarr also noted that the private sale of dinosaurs isn't limited to T. rex. The luxury fossil market includes all kinds of dinosaurs — the most expensive ever sold was a stegosaurus, auctioned for $44.6 million in 2024. (It is currently on loan to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City). Carr hopes his study will inspire other researchers to examine how the commercial market is impacting other ancient species, like he has done for T. rex.\n\n\"My hope is that concerned colleagues will start counting up, and publishing on, the specimens of the species that they study that are lost to the commercial market,\" Carr said.\n\nResearchers react to T. rex trade\n\nThomas Holtz, Jr. , a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland, has been researching the changes in Tyrannosaurus during its growth, and said it was \"disheartening\" to find out that many critical specimens that would help to clarify those changes aren't accessible.\n\n\"Much like Carr, I am concerned not merely that there are good specimens which are not accessible to researchers, but especially that juvenile and sub-adult specimens happen to be overrepresented in the commercial samples,\" Holtz told Live Science.\n\nDavid Hone , a reader in zoology at Queen Mary University of London, told Live Science that while he'd love to see more specimens in public collections, he wasn't as concerned about the T. rex fossil trade as Carr."}

If your daily habits aren’t helping you, they’re hurting you. Here are some fairly common and widespread examples of the latter that will drain all your joy and inner peace if you let them:\n\n1. Focusing on how life “should” be every step of the way.\n\nTry to use frustration and inconvenience to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of the way you look at life. Instead of getting angry, find the lesson. In place of envy, feel admiration. In place of worry, take action. In place of doubt, have faith. Remember that your response is always more powerful than your present circumstance. A small part of your life is decided by completely uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of your life is decided by your responses. Where you ultimately end up is heavily dependent on how you play the hands you’ve been dealt.\n\n2. Wanting to control the uncontrollable.\n\nBe selective with your energy today. If you can fix a problem, fix it. If you can’t, then accept it and change your thoughts about it. Whatever you do, don’t attempt to invest more energy than you have, tripping over something behind you or something that only exists inside your head. Truth be told, some of the most powerful moments in life happen when you find the courage to let go of what can’t be changed. Because when you are no longer able to change a situation, you are challenged to change yourself — to grow beyond the unchangeable. And that changes everything.\n\n3. Holding tightly to the way things once were.\n\nYou’re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or even a week ago. You’re always learning and growing, and life is always evolving. Again, even though you can’t control everything that happens, you can control your attitude about what happens. And in doing so, you will gradually master change rather than allowing it to master you. So be humble today. Be teachable. The world is often bigger than your view of the world. There’s always room for a fresh idea or a next step. But first you must accept the fact that things may never go back to how they used to be, and that this ending is really a new beginning.\n\n4. Refusing to practice self-forgiveness.\n\nForgive yourself for the bad decisions you’ve made in the past, for the times you lacked understanding, for the choices that accidentally hurt others and yourself. Forgive yourself, for being young and reckless. These are all vital lessons. And what matters most right now is your willingness to grow from them. (Note: Angel and I discuss this further in the Adversity chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)\n\n5. Endlessly settling for the default settings.\n\nThere are thousands of people who live their entire lives on the default settings, never acknowledging the fact that they can customize everything. Don’t be one of them — don’t settle for the default settings on a daily basis. Don’t hide behind indecision or laziness either. And forget popularity! Just do your thing with passion, humility, and honesty. Do what you do, not for an applause, but because it’s what’s right. Pursue it a little bit each day, no matter what anyone else thinks. That’s how dreams are achieved.\n\n6. Resisting new ideas and lessons.\n\nTo make real progress in the long run you must let go of the assumption that you already have all the answers. So don’t stop learning! Don’t stop investing in yourself. Research. Read. Devour books. Engage with people, including those who think differently. Ask questions. Listen closely. And don’t just grow in knowledge. Be a person who gives back. Use what you’re learning to make a real and lasting difference. (Note: “The Good Morning Journal” is a great tool for noticing and keeping track of all your lessons learned.)\n\n7. Constantly seeking fleeting contentment.\n\nThere are two variations of contentment in life — fleeting and enduring. The fleeting type is derived from instants of material comfort, while the enduring type is attained through the gradual growth and progress on matters that are truly important to you. At a quick glimpse it might be difficult to decipher one from the other, but as time rolls on it becomes vividly obvious that the latter is far superior. So just remember, if it entertains you now but will hurt or bore you someday, it’s a distraction. Don’t settle. Don’t exchange what you want most for what you kinda want at the moment. Study your routines. Figure out where your time goes, and remove distractions. It’s time to focus more on what matters in the long run.\n\n8. Always worrying about everyone else’s story.\n\nDon’t be so satisfied with the success stories of others and how things have gone for them, that you forget to write your own. Unfold your own tale and bring it to life on a daily basis. You have everything you need to become what you are capable of becoming. Incredible change happens when you decide to make yourself a priority. And remember, you won’t always be a priority to others, and that’s why you have to be a priority to yourself. Learn to respect yourself, take care of yourself, and become a daily part of your own support system. This means consuming less and creating more. It means refusing to let others do your thinking, talking, and deciding for you. It means learning to embrace and use your ideas and instincts to write your passage, one day at a time.\n\n9. Fearing little (necessary) failures.\n\nSometimes we literally have to fail dozens of times to succeed. And no matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you are still way ahead of everyone who isn’t trying. So don’t get so hung up on a few failed attempts that you miss the opening for a hundred more opportunities. All of your ideas that don’t work are simply stepping stones to the one idea that does. And remember, failure is not falling down; failure is staying down when you have the choice to get back up. Always get back up! Oftentimes good things fall apart in the near term so better things can fall together in the end.\n\n10. Waiting for the “perfect” moment to take the next step.\n\nDon’t buy into the myth of the perfect moment. Moments aren’t perfect, they’re what you make of them. So many people wait around for the stars to align to do what they’re here to do. The perfect moment, the perfect opportunity, the perfect state of being, etc. Wake up! Don’t “wait” away the vast majority of your life! Remind yourself that too many people wait all day for 5pm, all week for Friday, all year for the holidays, all their lives for happiness. And you don’t be one of them. Ultimately, you will come to succeed not by finding a perfect moment, but by learning to see and use life’s imperfections as stepping stones.\n\nAn Exercise for Building Better Daily Habits\n\nIf you feel a like you’ve wasted too much time, joy, and peace on one or more of the points above, this quick actionable closing exercise is for YOU.\n\nChoose any area in your life that you want to improve, and then:\n\nWrite down the specific details about your current circumstances. (What’s bothering you? Where are you stuck? What do you want to change?) Write down your answer to this question: What are the daily habits that have contributed to your current circumstances? (Be honest with yourself. What are you doing regularly that actually contributes to the situation you’re in?) Write down a few specific details about the “better circumstances” you’d like to create for yourself. (What would make you happy? What does an improved situation look like for you?) Write down your answer to this question: What are the daily habits that will get you from where you are to where you want to be? (Think about it. What small, daily steps will help you gradually move forward from point A to point B?)\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nYes, it’s your turn to not fall back into your old patterns of living today simply because they’re more comfortable and easier to access. It’s your turn to remember that you’re leaving certain habits and situations behind for a reason: to improve your life — because you can’t move forward if you keep going back. And it’s undoubtedly your turn to reclaim your inner peace and joy, and make your time count going forward!\n\nBut before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay.

By using specific wallpapers in combination with built-in accessibility settings, you can achieve a unique and polished look that reflects your style. The video from iDeviceHelp provides a step-by-step walkthrough, explains the tools required, and highlights the customization possibilities available to you.\n\nThe Significance of Dock Customization\n\nThe dock is a central part of your iPhone’s interface, serving as the home for your most frequently used apps.

By changing its color, you can align your iPhone’s look with your preferences, whether you favor bold, vibrant shades or subtle, muted tones. This customization option allows you to make your device feel more personal and visually appealing.\n\nStep 1: Select the Right Wallpaper\n\nThe foundation of dock customization lies in the wallpaper you choose. The design and color of the wallpaper directly influence the dock’s appearance. To get started:\n\nDownload custom wallpapers specifically designed to alter the dock color. These wallpapers are available in a variety of shades, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, and white.\n\nSave the wallpapers to your iPhone’s camera roll for quick access.\n\nChoosing a wallpaper that complements your style is essential. The right wallpaper will not only enhance the dock’s color but also create a cohesive look for your device.\n\nStep 2: Set the Wallpaper\n\nOnce you’ve selected a wallpaper, follow these steps to apply it as your background:\n\nOpen your iPhone’s wallpaper settings by navigating to Settings > Wallpaper > Choose a New Wallpaper .\n\n. Select the downloaded wallpaper from your camera roll.\n\nAdjust the position of the wallpaper to ensure the dock area aligns with the desired color.\n\nFor a more refined appearance, enable the blur effect during this process. The blur effect softens the transition between the wallpaper and the dock, creating a seamless and visually pleasing result.\n\nStep 3: Activate the Reduce Transparency Feature\n\nThe “Reduce Transparency” feature is a critical step in making the dock color more prominent. This setting reduces the transparency of system elements, giving the dock a solid and defined appearance. To enable this feature:\n\nGo to Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size .\n\n. Toggle on the “Reduce Transparency” option.\n\nWhen combined with your chosen wallpaper, this feature enhances the dock’s color, making it stand out more effectively. It’s a simple adjustment that significantly impacts the overall look of your iPhone.\n\nOptional: Assign Reduce Transparency to the Action Button\n\nFor added convenience, you can assign the “Reduce Transparency” feature to the Action Button. This allows you to toggle the setting on or off quickly without navigating through multiple menus. To set this up:\n\nGo to Settings > Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut .\n\n. Select “Reduce Transparency” from the list of available options.\n\nThis shortcut provides greater control over your iPhone’s appearance, making it easy to switch between different dock styles as desired.\n\nStep 4: Experiment with Customization Options\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of this method is its flexibility. You can easily refresh your iPhone’s look by experimenting with different wallpapers and settings. To explore customization options:\n\nChoose a new wallpaper from the available options to change the dock color.\n\nAdjust the wallpaper’s position to align the dock area with the desired shade.\n\nEnable the blur effect and “Reduce Transparency” feature to achieve a polished appearance.\n\nThis process allows you to update your device’s look whenever you want, making sure it always feels fresh and personalized.\n\nWhy This Approach is Effective\n\nThis method works by combining custom wallpapers with built-in accessibility features to create a cohesive and visually appealing dock. The blur effect enhances the overall aesthetic by softening transitions, while the “Reduce Transparency” feature ensures the dock color is bold and prominent. Together, these tools provide a simple yet effective way to customize your iPhone without relying on third-party apps or complicated adjustments.\n\nBy following these steps, you can transform your iPhone’s dock into a reflection of your personal style. Whether you prefer vibrant, eye-catching colors or understated, minimalist tones, this approach offers endless possibilities for customization. Take a few moments to experiment with different combinations and enjoy a device that feels uniquely yours.\n\nUncover more insights about iPhone dock customization in previous articles we have written.\n\nSource & Image Credit: iDeviceHelp\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.
