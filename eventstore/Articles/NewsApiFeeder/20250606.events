Through the XOVR ETF, which primarily invests (85% +) in the US Entrepreneurial Large Cap ER30TR Index, ERShares continues ...its pursuit to provide retail investors access to private equity\ufffdwhich we believe offers exposure to high-growth, entrepreneurial companies typically reserved for institutions and high net worth investors, and does so at the same pricing available to those accredited investors.\nXOVR complies with SEC guidelines by keeping private equity exposure under 15%, with over 85% of the portfolio tracking the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR)\ufffdbuilt on ERShares\ufffd proprietary Entrepreneur model, applied to public markets for more than two decades. Given its weighting, the ER30TR Index drives the majority of XOVR\ufffds return, while the private holdings offer potential upside and added diversification.\nPrivate equity investments can experience significant price swings\ufffdboth upward and downward\ufffdover extended periods, even if valuations are not marked frequently. Additionally, private equities are inherently less liquid and less transparent than their public counterparts, resulting in higher risk profiles despite comparable market capitalizations.\nAs with all investments, public equities can be volatile, though they have historically offered meaningful return potential over time. Private companies may magnify both opportunity and risk, which is why ERShares encourages investors to consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\nTo help manage risk, ERShares applies structured parameters around the size and scope of its private holdings. The due diligence process for these positions mirrors the same rigorous methodology used in constructing the ER30TR Index\ufffdadapted for private markets.\nRelaunched on August 29, 2024, XOVR became the first ETF to blend public equities with private equity holdings \ufffd potentially delivering diversified, liquid access to both high-growth public companies and elite pre-IPO firms. This ETF Crossover structure helps bridge two previously disconnected markets in one transparent vehicle.\nOn May 30, 2025, ERShares initiated a $3M (approx. 1%) investment in Anduril, marking XOVR\ufffds third private equity holding - after SpaceX ($33M, approx. 10%) and Klarna ($2M, less than 1%) - and establishing Anduril as its second-largest private position. The move reflects ERShares\ufffd conviction in companies that sit at the intersection of innovation, national importance, and scalable disruption.\ufffdThe position was selected after extensive internal research and due diligence, consistent with ERShares\ufffd proprietary Venture Capital-style framework for evaluating private and public companies.\n\ufffdOur proprietary research model identifies category-defining companies before they go public,\ufffd said Dr. Joel Shulman, Founder and CIO of ERShares. \ufffdAnduril embodies the deep tech leadership and mission-driven innovation we seek for XOVR.\ufffd\nERShares also recently increased its SpaceX position at $185 per share - matching its previous entries - to reaffirm confidence in the company\ufffds valuation amid market speculation.\nBridging Public and Private Markets\n\ufffdWe\ufffdre not just following innovation - we\ufffdre positioning investors at its source,\ufffd said Eva Ados, Chief Investment Strategist at ERShares. \ufffdWhether private or public, our focus is on trying to identify the next Magnificent Seven (The \"Magnificent 7\" currently refers to a group of seven large-cap, high-growth U.S. technology companies: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA))\ufffdthose rare, transformational companies that have the potential to shape entire decades of innovation and growth.\ufffd\ufffdAnduril Industries: The Next Generation of Defense Technology\nFounded by Palmer Luckey - creator of Oculus and a key early collaborator with Palantir - Anduril Industries represents the next generation of defense technology. Anduril is rapidly becoming foundational to U.S. military modernization initiatives.\nTransparent Valuation Backed by Research\nERShares uses a structured valuation methodology to price private equity holdings - drawing from tender offers, internal transactions, IPO indicators, and comparables \ufffd to help ensure pricing is fair, consistent, and market-aware. This framework helps protect investors while maintaining daily liquidity and regulatory compliance.\nInvesting in the Future - Before the IPO\nWith positions in SpaceX, Klarna, and now Anduril, XOVR remains the only ETF offering diversified access to potentially high growth private companies alongside expanding public innovators. The fund allows investors to participate in the potential next wave of value creation - before it goes public.\n\ufffdWe built XOVR to give retail investors access to leading private companies at the critical pre-IPO stage,\ufffd added Dr. Shulman. \ufffdIt is time they participate in the value creation that was once reserved only for institutions and accredited investors.\ufffd\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results, please refer to the disclosures below for important risk information:\ufffdhttps://entrepreneurshares.com/disclosures/\nAll investing involves risk, including potential loss of principal.\nDistributed by Vigilant Distributors LLC.\nMedia Contact: info@ershares.com"}
