While Instagram does not grant permission for companies to embed these images, a 2007 Ninth Circuit ruling known as the “server test” established that when an image remains on a third party’s server and is not stored on the infringer’s computer, embedding it does not count as a new display. In other words, embedding the original display of the image in a new context does not constitute copyright infringement.\n\nDigital Camera World reports that McGucken’s petition asks the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of the server test and consider whether a website’s unauthorized display of an image violates copyright, no matter what technology is used to show the work.\n\nThe district courts and Ninth Circuit court both dismissed McGucken’s complaints. But the photographer is now turning to the Supreme Court to consider if displaying an image using embedding tools infringes copyright laws. The court will respond by May 1.\n\nThis is not the first time a photographer has attempted to challenge the server test. In 2023, Instagram beat a class of photographers in a lawsuit that claimed the Meta-owned platform contributes to copyright infringement by letting outside websites embed images.\n\nPhotographers Alexis Hunley and Matthew Brauer filed a class action lawsuit against Instagram after Buzzfeed and Time embedded their images without consent. Hunley and Brauer claimed that Instagram abused their copyright by allowing news outlets like Time and Buzzfeed to embed the photos that they shared to their profiles.\n\nHowever, a three-judge panel at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Instagram was not liable for copyright infringement because when a photo or video is embedded, no copy is made of the underlying content.\n\nImage credits: Header photo licensed via Depositphotos."}

Trump’s order therefore raises the question: should Americans accept incomplete, or inaccurate, stories of national \"greatness\" in place of the messy realities of history? The case of one of the famous moments in American history—Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox—dramatically illustrates the dangers of letting myth substitute for accurate history. For generations, Americans learned the same basic story about the end of the Civil War. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Va. In a sublime moment of selflessness, the two great leaders nobly transcended their differences and chose the path of peace and reconciliation. Grant paid homage to Confederate courage by setting lenient surrender terms, which let the defeated rebels go home unpunished. In a reciprocal show of respect, Lee handed over his ceremonial sword to Grant, only to have his counterpart return it. The two men effectively ended the war and set the stage for America’s rise as a world power.\n\nThis story, however, was never true. Instead, it originated in 19th-century Americans’ yearning for a swift reunion, which could sweep away the unresolved issues of the war. The story served as a resolution to help prove that America was unique and not destined to experience the interminable rivalries and miseries of the Old World. But politically, Appomattox settled nothing. Rather than a time of reconciliation, Lee’s surrender was a moment in which a wide range of Americans, including both generals, staked rival political claims. Read More: Civil War History Shows the Danger of Comparing Trump to Jesus Neither Grant nor Lee arrived at Appomattox expecting to heal, in one grand gesture, the fractured country. Both men were fierce warriors, deeply committed to their respective causes. Far from proposing lenient surrender terms to exonerate the Confederates, Grant did so in an effort to change their hearts and minds. He regarded the Union victory as one of right over wrong and wanted to secure Confederate repentance and compliance. The story that he handed back Lee’s sword was “the purest romance,” as Grant later wrote in his memoirs.\n\nGrant and his army believed that their victory vindicated the superiority of a free labor society over a slave labor society. African American Union regiments, which consisted mostly of men who had escaped slavery, felt their patriotic sacrifices had earned them the full rights of citizenship, including the right to vote. As William McCoslin of the 29th Regiment USCT put it in a May 1865 letter, “We the colored soldiers, have fairly won our rights by loyalty and bravery. ...shall we obtain them? If they are refused now, we shall demand them!” Confederates, by contrast, recoiled from both of these ideas and had little interest in repentance. Instead, Lee tried to claim the moral high ground, asserting that the Union victory was one of might over right. The goal was to deny the victors a mandate to govern the vanquished. His posture reflected the hope among most Confederates that their cause—one of establishing a slaveholding republic—might still somehow be vindicated. Confederate General William Nelson Pendleton decried the need to surrender to an army of “German, Irish, negro, and Yankee wretches,” men he and his fellow Confederates regarded as their social and racial inferiors.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given their lack of remorse, the Confederates also tried to avoid any consequences for their rebellion. At Appomattox, Lee requested that the Union army issue each of his soldiers a printed parole pass to vouch that if they went home and observed the laws in force where they resided, they would “remain undisturbed.” In an interview with the New York Herald a few weeks later, Lee warned that if the Yankee government adopted “arbitrary or vindictive or revengeful policies,” Southerners would consider the surrender terms breached and would renew the fight. In Lee’s eyes, one goal of this “gentlemen’s agreement” with Grant was to hold the line against Black civil rights. Lee and his allies sought the restoration—not the reimagining—of the South. He wanted to turn back the clock to before abolitionists had challenged slavery and Southern rule. In the aftermath of Appomattox, ex-Confederates moved quickly, using propaganda, fraud, and terrorism, to preempt Black freedom and impose a system akin to slavery.\n\nBoth Congress and the Union army, however, were unwilling to see the slave South recreated in all but name. The army maintained a tenuous occupation of the region. Congress also moved to grant freedpeople civil rights protections—provoking vehement objections from white Southerners that such measures violated the terms of the surrender, namely the promise that they would “remain undisturbed.” The dispute highlighted how the surrender meant two very different things to the victorious Union and defeated Confederates. When Grant became president in 1869 and tried to crack down on the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups, ex-Confederates demonized him as a radical extremist who had betrayed his promises to Lee. They also turned on any white Southerner who had the temerity to support Grant and Reconstruction. Confederate general James Longstreet became a pariah among white Southern conservatives because he had embraced the Republican Party and Black voting rights after the war. He had done so out of gratitude for Grant’s leniency at Appomattox.\n\nThis and other evidence exposed the reality behind the myth that the Appomattox “gentlemen’s agreement” restored national harmony. Not only was the story untrue, but it quickly became a weapon for ex-Confederates as they tried to shape the postwar settlement. Spreading their version of the myth allowed Confederates to cast themselves as the innocent victims of Reconstruction—even as they sowed chaos and violence in the South. When former Confederate general John Brown Gordon, who headed the Georgia KKK, testified before Congress in 1871 on the conditions in the Reconstruction South, he credited Lee and Grant with banishing the spirit of vengeance. The problem, he falsely asserted, was insurrectionary Southern Blacks, who revived it. This racist propaganda sought to justify white terrorism as a means of self-defense. Read More: How Black Civil War Patriots Should Be Remembered This Veterans Day\n\nThe myth about Appomattox thus became a key element of Lost Cause orthodoxy, a form of propaganda that glorified slavery and the Confederacy and demonized Reconstruction. It merged with efforts by the white South to put Lee on a pedestal, both figuratively and literally. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scores of Southern cities and towns erected Confederate memorials, like Richmond’s towering Lee statue, that aimed to block from public view any story, memory, or perspective that did not accord with the Lost Cause orthodoxy. The sanctification of Lee and other Confederate leaders, in turn, pushed the complexities of the surrender and of the Civil War era into the shadows, allowing the myth of Appomattox to flourish for more than a century. The weaponization of this moment exposes the dangers of allowing myths to continue to stand in for history. The Confederate interpretation of Appomattox did lasting damage to Americans’ quest for national progress and unity: it exonerated insurrectionists, lionized them as martyrs, and helped return them to power. The essence of the Lost Cause was that the Civil War was not lost and could yet be won by new forms of racial proscription; for white supremacists, the Jim Crow era of disfranchisement, segregation, and one-party Democratic rule in the South was that promise vindicated.\n\nTo peel back the layers of the Appomattox myth, and assess its damaging effects, is not to push a “baseless ideology” but instead to gain a clear-eyed, informed perspective on events that still reverberate in the present. A deeper, more nuanced account of Appomattox reveals that the war did not end neatly in April 1865 and that sectional animus was channeled into bitter partisan conflict. It helps Americans understand why Reconstruction failed and why racial justice has proved so elusive. Dispelling the myth reveals, too, counter-narratives to the dominant story, and the powerful lessons they might convey as Americans continue to grapple with the legacy of racism. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, an acclaimed Black abolitionist who toured the South in 1867, offered a telling counterpoint to Grant’s hopes for repentance and Lee’s for restoration. After listening to the “heart-saddening stories of grievous old wrongs” endured by formerly enslaved Southerners, she observed that the “shadows of the past” remained, but they bore “the promise of a brighter coming day. The work goes bravely on.\" For those in the postwar world determined to seize the promise of freedom, that was the true meaning of Appomattox.\n\nElizabeth R. Varon is Langbourne M.

The company hasn’t said when it will launch for all users.\n\nSome users, like Brodie Clark, reported seeing the Discover feed on desktops for logged-in accounts. This indicates that Google is beginning to test this feature before a wider rollout.\n\nWhat Is Google Discover?\n\nGoogle Discover is a feed that shows content based on what you might like. It appears in the Google app, Chrome’s new tab page, and google.com on phones.\n\nUnlike regular searches, you don’t need to type anything. Discover suggests content based on your interests and search history.\n\nAs Google defines it:\n\n“Discover is a part of Google Search that shows people content related to their interests, based on their Web and App Activity.”\n\nWhy This Matters: Discover’s Growing Impact on Publisher Traffic\n\nThis desktop launch is important as Discover has become a bigger traffic source for many sites.\n\nA January survey from NewzDash found that 52% of news publishers consider Discover a top priority. The survey also showed that 56% of publishers saw recent traffic increases from Discover.\n\nMartin Little from Reach plc (publisher of UK news sites like Daily Mirror) recently said that Google Discover has become their “single largest traffic referral source.”\n\nLittle told Press Gazette:\n\n“Discover is making up for [search traffic losses] and then some. Almost 50% of our titles are growing year-on-year now, partly because of the shifts in Google.”\n\nTracking Discover Traffic from Desktop\n\nPublishers should prepare to track this new traffic source. In Google Analytics 4, you can:\n\nSet up a page referrer filter for “pubsub2” traffic, which is primarily Discover traffic Add an additional device filter for “Desktop” to specifically monitor the desktop Discover rollout Monitor traffic patterns over time to identify spikes related to the desktop implementation\n\nWhile Google Search Console doesn’t currently have a way to filter by device type within the Discover reporting, this functionality may be added as the desktop release becomes official.\n\nOptimizing Content for Google Discover\n\nYou don’t need special markup or tags to appear in Discover. However, Google suggests these best practices:\n\nCreate quality content that matches user interests\n\nUse good, large images (at least 1200px wide)\n\nWrite honest titles that accurately describe your content\n\nDon’t use misleading previews to trick people into clicking\n\nFocus on timely, unique content that tells stories well\n\nLittle noted that Discover prefers “soft-lens” content – personal stories, lifestyle articles, and niche topics. Breaking news and hard news often don’t do as well.\n\n“You don’t get court content in there, no crime, our council content doesn’t get in there,” Little explained what Discover tends to avoid.\n\nDesktop Expansion: Potential Traffic Implications\n\nThe desktop rollout could significantly change traffic patterns for publishers already using mobile Discover.\n\nGoogle’s presentation slide at the Madrid event highlighted “expanding surfaces,” which suggests Google wants a more consistent experience across all devices.\n\nFor SEO pros, this is both an opportunity and a challenge. Desktop users browse differently from mobile users, which might affect how content performs in Discover.\n\nBuilding a Discover Strategy\n\nPublishers wanting to get more Discover traffic should consider these approaches:\n\nMonitor performance: Use Search Console’s Discover report to track how your content is doing.\n\nUse Search Console’s Discover report to track how your content is doing.

Use effective headlines: Publishers note that Discover often picks headlines with a “curiosity gap” – titles that tell enough of the story but hold back key details to encourage clicks.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nAs Google expands Discover to desktop, publishers should prepare for traffic changes. This move shows Google’s shift from just answering searches to actively suggesting content.\n\nWhile we don’t know the exact launch date, publishers who understand and optimize for Discover will have an advantage.\n\nFeatured Image: DJSully/Shutterstock"}

All three of those latter chips used AMD’s Zen 5 architecture.\n\nAMD’s Ryzen 8000HX lineup. AMD\n\nBoth AMD’s Ryzen 7000 HX and the refreshed Ryzen 8000 HX parts both use the older Zen 4 architecture, however, and there’s no NPU, either. In fact, both the older Ryzen 7000 parts and the latest Ryzen 8000 HX series both feature processors with up to 16 cores and 32 threads and can be used in laptops with 45 to 75 watts of thermal design power, or TDP. (The default is 55W.) Both families use AMD’s TSMC’s 5nm process. One of the more significant changes AMD made has been to phase out the six-core Ryzen 5 7645HX for an 8-core Ryzen 7 8745HX.\n\nThe 8000HX Series is a refresh of the 7000HX Series with a few key differences in clock speeds and firmware, an AMD representative said in an email. “However, the 8000HX Series is intended to be paired with newer, more powerful discrete GPUs, and offers users more options for those looking to get into systems with the latest graphics,” he added.\n\nAMD’s Ryzen 8000 HX series do include integrated graphics, though the Ryzen 610M inside the 8945HX and its two RDNA 2 graphics cores aren’t enough to serve as a gaming GPU, of course. Laptop makers will want to add a discrete GPU for that.\n\nAMD’s new Ryzen 8000 HX chips will use DDR5 SODIMM memory and have 28 lanes of PCI Express 5.0 available."}

But at the company’s 50th anniversary party, Microsoft showed off how a Windows-native Copilot Vision could walk you through complex apps like Adobe Photoshop, then visually show you what to do next.\n\nI thought the demo had enough potential to select it as the best Copilot demo Microsoft showed during the event.\n\nCopilot Vision isn’t always on. You’ll need to first click the small “binoculars” icon within Copilot to launch Vision, then specifically enable Copilot Vision for the application you want help with.\n\nI have a number of questions about Copilot Vision for Windows. How deeply does it know what to do? What can it see? Can it understand what it sees well enough to be useful? I’d say a key test would be its ability to walk me through a task on an unfamiliar piece of software—some on-screen handholding could be extremely helpful, if Vision got it right. But there will be those (me included!) who probably don’t want any help with more private matters like, say, personal finances.\n\nA Microsoft example of Copilot Vision for Windows. Microsoft\n\nYou have a chance to try Copilot Vision out for yourself, as Microsoft has started rolling it out for wider testing. Microsoft says you’ll need to be enrolled in one of its Windows Insider programs, but it doesn’t matter which one. However, it’s being rolled out via the Microsoft Store rather than through Windows Update. If you go to the Store app and download the latest Copilot update, you might get it. (Officially, you’ll need version 1.25034.133.0 or higher.)\n\n“The above-mentioned features are gradually rolling out so not all Insiders will get the update right away,” Microsoft said in a blog post. Copilot Vision will debut on US PCs first. As of press time, it has yet to land on the first Insider PC I checked, a Copilot+ laptop.\n\nWhen you update Copilot to get Vision, you’ll also get a new Copilot capability with it: desktop file search. Although you might be able to find a file via File Explorer, you should now also be able to query Copilot with questions like “Where is my resume?” and Copilot should find it and link to it. Microsoft also encourages you to try more sophisticated searches, such as finding the trip-planning document you worked on last week.

That loophole is now closed, thanks to the ongoing Trump tariffs — and it will likely get dramatically worse.\n\nA year ago, goods imported into the United States that were valued at less than $800 could be imported duty free, without being affected by tariffs. This was known as the de minimis exemption, and meant that individual consumers could largely escape any trade wars going on between nations, while still essentially being taxed for more expensive consumer goods and appliances.\n\nThat way of doing business ended April 2 on goods imported from China, according to an executive order from President Trump that closed the de minimis exemption and applied a tariff of 30 percent. Now, that’s changed yet again.\n\nAccording to an amendment to the order filed Tuesday night, the United States is now dramatically raising de minimis tariffs in line with Trump’s existing tariffs on China, which as of April 9 stood at 104 percent. Now, the de minimis tariff also stands at a whopping 90 percent, up from 30 percent a few days ago. (Trump said Wednesday, April 9, that he is raising tariffs on Chinese goods yet again, to 125 percent, while lowering tariffs on all other countries to 10 percent for 90 days.)\n\nIn addition, United States customs will also charge a tariff per “postal item,” or shipment, as well. Between May 2 and June 1, the “increase in per postal item containing goods” duty will be increased from $25 to $75. The order also includes a provision to boost this amount, after June 1, to $150.\n\nWhat this means for you: According to the amendment, the shop you buy from must report the value of the items, as well as the number of items, to U.S. Customs. Trump’s April 2 order was vague; it allows the U.S. government to apply a tariff of either 30 percent of the value of your order or else $25 per item. Now, Customs apparently can choose whether to tariff your shipment by 90 percent, or $75 per item. After June 1, the tariff rate (for now) is scheduled to remain the same, but U.S. Customs could increase the per-item tariff to a whopping $150 per item.\n\nSo how much will you be taxed to import cheap goods into the U.S. today, or after June 1? It’s not clear. Temu, for example, is headquartered in Boston, but is owned by a Chinese holding company; Shein is based in Singapore, but many of its operations are in China, too. AliExpress, owned by Chinese titan The Alibaba Group, is probably most clearly subject to Chinese tariffs. But storefronts like Amazon will also be subject to the tariffs, and anything shipped from China to the U.S. via Amazon will be tariffed, too.\n\nWhat is clear is that if you’ve been used to buying cheap stuff — whether it be fast fashion or electronics — from Chinese shops or companies, those days appear to be over. Buckle up."}

This feature was previously available in the optional KB5053656 update from March, and before that was available in the preview update mentioned below. The easiest way to install KB5055523 is via Windows Update.\n\nOriginal story from December 10, 2024: Microsoft seems to think Windows 11 users are clamoring for easier ways to insert emojis, as if we’re so constantly in need of quick access to emojis on a day-to-day basis that we need super shortcuts for it.\n\nWell, if that describes you, Microsoft wants you to know that they’re listening and they care. In the latest Windows 11 Insiders preview (Build 22635.4580), Microsoft has added an emoji panel to the taskbar, granting immediate access to emojis no matter what you’re doing.\n\nAlthough there’s already a keyboard shortcut for accessing the emoji panel — simply press Windows key + Period or Windows key + Semicolon — it’s clear that not everyone is aware of it. After all, who can really remember the hundreds of keypress combinations that exist?\n\nIf you don’t want the emoji panel in the taskbar, you can turn it off in the settings by navigating to Settings > Personalization > Taskbar, then under “System tray icons,” look for “Emojis and more.” Change the drop-down menu to Never to disable it.\n\nIf you aren’t a Windows 11 Insider, this feature will come to you soon enough. Keep an eye out for update KB5046733 in Windows Update, but we have no word on when exactly it will arrive as of yet."}

Update now!", "fullContent": "Do you use WhatsApp? If so, you need to be especially careful right now because there’s a security vulnerability in the Windows version—which many people still use every day—that can infect your PC with malware. WhatsApp has issued a security alert about the vulnerability, which is listed as CVE-2025-30401.\n\nBy exploiting this vulnerability, malicious actors can use attachments in MIME format (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)—a format the desktop version uses by default—to inject malware on PCs. The theft of sensitive data is also possible with this method.\n\nThe risk of an attack that takes advantage of this flaw is relatively high, but an affected user must first interact with the MIME attachment for it to be actively exploited. Nevertheless, you should always be careful when receiving WhatsApp messages from people you don’t know, especially when they contain unsolicited attachments.\n\nDangerous attachments are often disguised as harmless image files—and with one careless click, malware can be activated.\n\nIf you currently have WhatsApp for Windows installed on your PC, you should update to version 2.2450.6 (via the Microsoft Store) as soon as possible. In this version, the security vulnerability has been fixed and can no longer be actively exploited by attackers.\n\nThe normal WhatsApp app for Android and iOS devices is NOT affected by this issue, as the MIME format is only used for delivering content in the PC version of WhatsApp."}

Active use stopped due to an arsonist’s attempt to demolish the building in 2008. The building was subsequently restored in 2011 and is now the Lancaster History Museum.\n\nThe design for the courthouse has been attributed to Robert Mills, a prominent early American architect, and for this reason the structure was designated as a national historic landmark in 1973.\n\nMore interesting than the building itself are the events that allegedly took place on the site it occupies. It is said that the last witch trial to take place in the U.S., and possibly, the western world, occurred here. According to letters and articles published in the mid-1800s, a Chesterfield woman named Barbara Powers was accused of turning a young girl into a horse and riding her into town, at which point she burglarized local shops by shrinking herself and entering through the buildings’ keyholes. She subsequently rode the young girl to Chesterfield and Cheraw to steal goods in the same manner, before returning the girl to human form.\n\nThough some records of the allegations exist, records of the trial or verdict do not, so it is impossible to verify this story. Regardless, this is a very interesting bit of local legend."}

I review them, I build them, I occasionally even use them to type up computer news. And I was very impressed by 8BitDo’s first attempt at a mechanical keyboard. Even with a little retro goofy styling (the brand’s bread and butter), it was a great board at a great price. Today, you can get an even better one for just $59.99 via Woot. That’s a hefty $40 off.\n\nThe 8BitDo Retro Keyboard comes in several colorways, themed after the NES, Famicom, Atari, and even Xbox. This version is going for a more button-down look aping the legendary IBM Model M keyboard and other buckling-spring designs from the 80s. It’s not a buckling spring, though. It’s a standard, modern mechanical keyboard, complete with some impressive wireless options and hot-swap switch sockets that let you customize your typing experience.\n\nThe Kailh Box White switches that come in the box are loud and clicky. It also has a couple of programmable add-on buttons (also hot-swap). Sure, they don’t make sense with the Model M color choice, but they’re still fun. The PBT keycaps that come with the keyboard are pretty great, but if white and gray aren’t your thing, you can easily swap them out thanks to its standard TKL layout. For more details, check out my full review.\n\nWhile $100 was already a pretty good deal for a solid keyboard with both wireless and hot-swap capabilities, this $60 sale price is fantastic. Amazon subsidiary Woot is offering this deal, and unlike many of its sales, it’s a new (not refurbished) keyboard with a long deal time. There are 12 days left on the sale at the time of this writing, but as with all Woot deals, it might go out of stock before then.\n\nGet this 8BitDo wireless mechanical keyboard for 40% off"}

With just 60Hz of refresh and a 5ms response time, it ain’t the best for gaming.\n\nThis monitor comes with slim bezels and a minimalist design, so it’s an especially good pick if you intend to put two or three of them next to each other. Connectivity options are pretty basic here: a single full-sized HDMI 2.0 port and a single DisplayPort 1.2 connection. You also get two USB-A ports for peripherals. No built-in speakers on this one. If you don’t like the stand, you can mount it on a separate monitor arm with the standard 100x100mm VESA mount.\n\nAt this price, you can upgrade to a multi-4K-monitor setup and elevate your home office experience without wincing too hard at all.

Don’t push it too hard because it doesn’t have a dedicated graphics card, but the integrated Intel Arc graphics are good enough if you’re willing to compromise on settings.\n\nWhile the 14-inch screen may not seem very large, it is a touchscreen. That’s great for convenient finger navigation, which comes in handy for reading PDFs, browsing the web, etc. And it all looks crisp with its 1920×1200 resolution, but the 60Hz refresh rate leaves something to be desired—it’s merely adequate for light gaming.\n\nThe Acer Swift Go 14 comes with two Thunderbolt 4 ports, which isn’t too common on laptops in this price range. These are super-fast USB-C ports that can transfer files in a flash and handle video display for external monitors. You also get two USB-A 3.2 ports, a full-sized HDMI 2.1 port, a headset jack, and a microSD card slot.

We love GaN chargers here at PCWorld because they’re just better in every way, and they don’t cost much more than older wall plugs if you can spot them on sale like this one.\n\nLong story short, this 65W Nexode model is speedy enough to charge a MacBook Air halfway in about half an hour, which means it’s more than fast enough to rejuice your smartphone, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, tablet, earbuds, and more. Basically, unless you have a high-end laptop that needs more than 65W of charging, you’re good to go.\n\nThis thing can handle up to four devices at once, too. You get two high-speed USB-C ports (65W max each), a lower-speed USB-C (30W max), and a nominal USB-A port (22.5W max). Note that you’ll only get the 65W max throughput with single port use. When charging multiple devices simultaneously, the power gets split up accordingly.\n\nThe Ugreen Nexode charger is perfect for traveling, by the way, because it’s not only small but also has foldable prongs. It won’t get caught on stuff, nor will it damage other devices, nor will the prongs get bent, and it can easily slip into most bags. Nice.\n\nYou deserve a faster-charging wall plug that minimizes cable clutter and doesn’t take up much space itself. Go ahead and grab yourself the 65W Ugreen Nexode on Amazon for just $26 (was $43).\n\nSave 40% on this 4-device GaN charger wall plug"}

In 20 minutes, I’ll add evaporated milk and lower the heat, then wait again as it simmers. To make Zaynab Issa’s Karak Chai, you’re committing to patience and the payoff: a spicy, milky tea that warms you from head to toe.\n\nChai means tea, any tea, but the Starbucks-ification of tea makes us immediately associate it with the milky, cardamom-enhanced version. “I’ve ordered my fair share,” laughed Zaynab, whose gorgeous cookbook, Third Culture Cooking, is a playful blend of recipes that touch on her family’s Khoja identity — a diaspora of Indians who migrated to East Africa, among other places — but also the fact that she grew up in New Jersey and worked in Bon Appétit’s test kitchen.\n\nZaynab describes “third culture cooking” as a category that “helps define a bunch of children of immigrants” because her food isn’t Khoja + American, it’s all over the (delicious) place. There are Mall Cinnamon Rolls, Samosa-Spiced Smashed Burgers, and French Onion Ramen. The book’s design will draw you into her beautiful world, and the Karak Chai will brighten your own.\n\n“This chai is not casual,” Zaynab told me. And neither is she. The author and New York Times Cooking contributor is always impeccably dressed (and in fact, we spoke after she’d zipped out of a fashion show in New York, where she lives).\n\nThe secret to making a tea-forward chai, Zaynab writes in her book, is to use a British black tea, like Tetley or PG Tips. Those stronger teas can take a half hour of steeping and come out fighting. (Lipton could never.) When Zaynab was a kid, they’d visit family in Canada and stock up on Tetley, unboxing it into Ziploc bags and stuffing their luggage. But now it’s more readily available — I found it at Meijer in Michigan.\n\nWe talked about how, in a culture that doesn’t drink alcohol, the nuance and ritual of tea hits some of those same notes. “There’s intentionality” to drinking chai, she said, in the same way you might open an aged bottle of bourbon. Often, her mom will put on the Pyrex Flameware glass kettle while they’re still eating dinner, to get it started, and it’ll simmer while the dishes are washed and the table cleared. When everyone moves into the living room to chat, the chai will be ready. “The pot of tea stretches out the evening,” says Zaynab. “It keeps us together longer.”\n\nKarak Chai, two ways\n\nFrom Third Culture Cooking, by Zaynab Issa\n\nServes 6\n\n35 minutes\n\nSays Zaynab: The spices used can vary from household to household, but cardamom is essential. This amount of sugar feels like the minimum for a pleasant drinking experience, but feel free to adjust it… or simply serve the tea with a bowl of sugar alongside with spoons for people to sweeten to their liking. Fair warning, someone will absolutely use the dry sugar spoon to mix their chai and return it to the now-clumpy sugar bowl. That’s when I have to remind myself to breathe — it’s all part of the experience.\n\n4 Tetley brand tea bags or PG Tips, or 4 teaspoons black tea leaves\n\n13 cardamom pods, cracked\n\n3-inch cinnamon stick\n\n3 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus more to taste (or cane or light brown sugar)\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract, optional\n\n1 cup (240 ml) evaporated milk\n\nCombine 6 cups (1.4 L) water, tea bags, cardamom, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla in a stove-safe tea kettle or medium pot. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Stir in the evaporated milk and return to a boil, watching carefully to ensure the tea doesn’t boil over — once the milk is introduced, boiling over is common at a rolling boil. Once just boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, creamy, and caramel in color, about 25 minutes. The longer the tea simmers, the stronger and creamier it will be, although it will also reduce in volume. Taste for desired sweetness and add more sugar to your taste.\n\nStrain the chai through a fine-mesh sieve into mugs; discard the spices and tea bags. Serve with additional sugar on the side.\n\nVariation with cocoa:\n\nWhisk in 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder with the tea, spices, sugar, and vanilla.\n\nThank you, Zaynab!\n\nAlex Beggs is a writer and copywriter who lives with her partner in Michigan.

Having to run an extra RAM-sucking program in the background is never fun, but the UI and basic functionality of these apps often leave a lot to be desired. Thankfully, Corsair is now making that optional—at least some of the time—with a brand-new web interface for firmware updates.\n\nCorsair’s iCue program has long been its all-in-one solution for anything to do with mice, keyboards, controllers, headsets, cooling, lighting, and extra gadgets from acquisitions like Elgato. But as PCGamer reports, the new online firmware updater tool can make it obsolete, at least for the task of… well, updating firmware.\n\nTo use it, you simply go to the site on a standard web browser, you authorize it to access your hardware via the pop-up, and it can install the latest firmware. Super easy, barely an inconvenience.\n\nCorsair\n\nI happen to be using a Corsair keyboard—the K70 Pro TKL—as a review unit right now. The web tool was able to identify the correct model, discover that the firmware was outdated, and update it without a hitch.\n\nCorsair isn’t the first company to do this. In fact, the update-via-browser method is pretty popular for smaller vendors who can’t afford to develop a robust independent application. Notably, companies like Keychron use a web-based tool for both standard key assignments and other customizations and updating device firmware.\n\nThis tool from Corsair isn’t quite there yet. It can only do firmware updates, not, say, a full key layout customization or other adjustments. So if you want to use your PC gaming gear to the fullest—or at least want to assign those settings to device memory before shutting the software down—you still need an installed version of iCue. It’s also basically impossible to set up specific profiles to launch on a per-game or per-program basis without some kind of tool running in the background, which means the most dedicated PC gamers will still lean on iCue.\n\niCue isn’t terrible, but it’s a hassle, even for someone who’s used to this sort of thing. I’m glad Corsair is offering options to let people avoid it."}

Trump threatened TSMC, the world’s most prolific silicon chip manufacturer, with company-specific tariffs if they didn’t accede to his demands.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Trump threatened Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company with an additional 100 percent tax “if you don’t build your plant here” when speaking to the Republican National Congressional Committee. This would, presumably, be in addition to the current 32 percent tariff rate on imports from Taiwan itself. Approximately 60 percent of the world’s chip manufacturing occurs in Taiwan, focused on the most cutting-edge products, with TSMC producing the lion’s share. The US currently manufactures 12 percent.\n\nTSMC, among competing chip manufacturers, had already committed to building fabrication plants within the United States as part of the CHIPS Act, a $52 billion stimulus package enacted during former President Biden’s administration. Last month, TSMC announced a $100 billion investment in US-based manufacturing centered in massive facilities in Arizona. This appears to be the announcement for which Trump is taking credit, in whole or in part.\n\nTSMC’s current American capacity is completely sold through for the next two years. It seems extremely unlikely that TSMC—or any chip manufacturer—will be able to create enough output to supply even the domestic electronics demand of the United States within the next few years. The majority of new electronics will still need to be imported, in whole or in part, subjecting consumers to massively increased prices to offset the government’s import taxes on goods and materials.\n\nCompanies like Razer have paused shipments of laptops entirely, and both Nintendo and Framework have delayed the pre-order process for the new Switch 2 gaming console and lower-priced Framework 12 laptop, respectively. Vaio is advertising “tariff-free” prices for its Japan-manufactured stock that presumably arrived in the US before tariffs began being levied against fresh supplies.\n\nWhile countries like South Korea and Japan are reportedly trying to negotiate with Trump, China’s position as the world’s leading manufacturer of finished goods puts it in a more advantageous position for trade negotiations, and it has instituted its own tariffs in response to Trump’s declarations. In short: China needs US imports far less than the US needs Chinese exports. Expect similar disruptions to continue indefinitely."}

This 2-in-1 with a touchscreen is intended to offer repairability and upgrades to cheaper laptops. Now there’s a confirmed pre-order date, April 9.\n\nUpdate, Wednesday, April 9th: Framework has announced that it is delaying Framework 12 pre-orders for the United States, in response to president Trump’s tariffs, which are now as high as 104 percent on goods imported from China and 32 percent in Framework’s primary supply partners in Taiwan. “We’re holding the next step, repricing products for sale in the US, until we have final confirmation that there is no alternative. We’ll keep you updated as we make changes, as well as on when we’ll be able to open Framework Laptop 12 in the US.” Framework has also had to stop offering the least-expensive versions of the original 13-inch laptop design in the US, as import taxes would force it to be sold at a loss. Framework will open pre-orders to other countries it supplies later today. Update, Wednesday April 9th…again: The Trump admininstration has updated its tariff position, imposing an even steeper 125 percent tariff on Chinese import while lowering taxes to other countries, including Taiwan, down to 10 percent. Framework has re-implemented its existing prices for many existing laptops, with a 10 percent rise on some models, some storage, and pre-orders for the latest designs based around new AMD hardware. The Framework 12 has gone up for pre-order in Canada with a July delivery estimate, starding at $720 Canadian for a barebones model without OS, RAM, storage, or charger. But but the new design is still not available for pre-order in the United States. The original story from last week continues below.\n\nThe Framework 12 takes aim at budget designs that are ” janky, locked-down, disposable, underpowered, and frankly, boring machines,” according to CEO Nirav Patel. And indeed, it’s a colorful TPU/ABS plastic design offered in blue, pink, green, and a relatively buttoned-down silver or black, and that’s before you trick it out with the company’s signature add-on modules for various USB ports, HDMI ports, card readers, et cetera. It’s also the company’s first convertible design, with a 12-inch touchscreen that’s compatible with stylus input.\n\nThe Laptop 12 is intended to be a budget machine, or at least a budget alternative, so it’s notably “chunkier” than the existing Laptop 13 design. But it still has the same kind of hardware flexibility, with every internal and external component accessible to the user with a screwdriver, and four modular USB-C ports that can be swapped out on the fly. The Intel 13th-gen-based motherboard (i3 or i5) can handle up to 48GB of RAM and 2TB of M.2 storage, with a choice of Windows or Linux at purchase.\n\nWe’re still waiting on perhaps the most crucial element of the Framework 12, the price. With the company specifically targeting low-price “craptops,” the price of the design — particularly the cheapest configuration — will be a huge factor in whether it succeeds or not. After all, someone who’s budgeted for a $500 laptop has a lot harder time stretching up to the $1,000 mark, no matter how much more flexible and upgradeable the latter is. With import tariffs in the U.S. sending electronics prices ever higher, there’s still a lot of uncertainty floating around.\n\nWe’ll find out in a week, I suppose. There’s also no precise shipping date, though “mid-2025” was given at the announcement event. I hope Framework can hit approximately a $750 price tag with the Framework 12, otherwise it’ll be a tough sell for the budget market."}

Here’s what I found out…\n\nWet USB cables: The lowdown\n\nWhile most USB cables are water resistant, it’s important to note that this is the kind of water resistance you can expect from a knockoff 1980s analog wristwatch, meaning you can splash them a little bit without there being much of a problem, but you generally don’t want to submerge them in water — they’re simply not made for that.\n\nThe most vulnerable part of a USB cable is the connector, since it’s open to the environment and not bound by plastic or rubber. Regardless of where your cable gets wet, you should shut down the device you’re using quickly and then unplug it if it’s plugged in.\n\nYou also shouldn’t use the cable right away but wait an hour or more until it dries out first. This ensures that you’re not transferring the corrosive water (or coffee as it may be) to your USB port or allowing the liquid to damage the cable itself. You can also help dry out your cable with a few carefully applied techniques.\n\nHow to dry your cables\n\nIf your cable gets wet, you can use a cloth to dry it off, running a closed hand down its length. If the connector gets water inside it, give it a little shake to get any droplets out first. Then use the end of a tissue or a microfiber cloth to carefully poke inside and soak up any remaining droplets that remain there.\n\nI used the above techniques on my USB cable connector and found it worked perfectly once I plugged it in again.\n\nWant a quick solution? Try this…\n\nA hairdryer can speed up the process of drying out a connector if it has water inside it, but there are a few steps you’ll want to take to protect your cable from being melted by the hairdryer’s powerful heat.\n\nFirst, you should always switch the hairdryer to the lowest heat setting.\n\nYou’re also going to want to keep your cable at a safe distance from the hairdryer’s nozzle, to ensure you get a constant flow of hot air that won’t start to burn the cable or connector — a distance of 14 inches should do the trick.\n\nA wet USB cable can be dried and used again. Pexels: Liza Summer\n\nDrying with a hairdryer should get your cable dry enough to reuse in just 15 minutes rather than several hours, but just be sure to check that it’s completely dry before plugging it in.\n\nSo, in summary, while most cables do have some level of water resistance and will survive being splashed or momentarily dunked in water (or other beverage), you should still apply caution before using one again and dry it out completely to keep your devices safe from harm."}

Or should you save the money and buy the 11th-generation ‌iPad‌? This guide helps you to understand the differences between the two models and decide which is best for you.\n\n\n\nThe 11th-generation ‌iPad‌ is positioned as an entry-level model with essential features for basic use, while the ‌iPad Air‌ is for users who need more from their tablet, such as students, creatives, or anyone who wants a future-proof device with newer, more advanced features. All of the differences between the entry-level ‌iPad‌ and the ‌iPad Air‌ are listed below:\n\n‌iPad‌ (11th generation) ‌iPad Air‌ (seventh generation) 11-inch display 11- or 13-inch display 500 nits max SDR brightness 11-inch: 500 nits max SDR brightness\n\n13-inch: 600 nits max SDR brightness sRGB Wide color (P3) Fully laminated display Anti‑reflective coating Apple Intelligence support Stage Manager support A16 chip (introduced with iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, made with TSMC's 4nm N4P process) M3 chip (introduced with iMac in 2023, made with TSMC's N3B process) 16 billion transistors 25 billion transistors 5-core CPU with 2 performance cores and 3 efficiency cores 8-core CPU with 4 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores 4-core GPU 9-core GPU Hardware-accelerated ray tracing Hardware-accelerated 8K HEVC, 4K H.264, ProRes and ProRes RAW Video decode engine Video encode engine ProRes encode and decode engine AV1 decode 16-core Neural Engine (17 TOPs) 16-core Neural Engine (18 TOPs) 6GB memory 8GB memory 51.2GB/s memory bandwidth 100GB/s memory bandwidth Wi-Fi 6 connectivity Wi-Fi 6E connectivity Landscape 12MP Center Stage camera with ƒ/2.4 aperture Landscape 12MP Center Stage camera with ƒ/2.0 aperture Weighs 477 grams (1.05 pounds) 11-inch: 460 grams (1.01 pounds)\n\n13-inch: 616 grams (1.36 pounds) 7 mm (0.28 inches) depth 6.1 mm (0.24 inches) depth Smart Connector (side) ‌Smart Connector‌ (back) Supports Magic Keyboard Folio Supports Magic Keyboard for ‌iPad Air‌ Supports Apple Pencil (USB‑C) and ‌Apple Pencil‌ (first generation) Supports ‌Apple Pencil‌ (USB‑C) and ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro ‌Apple Pencil‌ hover 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB storage Available in Blue, Pink, Silver, and Yellow Available in Blue, Purple, Starlight, and Space Gray Starts at $349 11-inch: Starts at $599\n\n13-inch: Starts at $799\n\nThe entry-level ‌iPad‌ is best for people who mainly use their ‌iPad‌ for light, everyday tasks. If your typical day includes browsing Safari, watching YouTube or Netflix, reading articles, messaging friends, and maybe doing some basic schoolwork or light gaming, the 11th-gen ‌iPad‌ has more than enough power and suitable features.\n\nThe A16 chip is still very capable, and the device still has ‌Apple Pencil‌ support for casual note-taking or drawing. However, the display is not laminated, which means there's a slight air gap between the glass and the screen content—something most users won't notice unless they're drawing or writing precisely. The entry-level ‌iPad‌ also lacks the anti-reflective coating, so it can be more reflective in bright lighting, as well as wide color support.\n\nIt's a great choice for students or casual users who don't need advanced multitasking features or professional apps. The starting price of $349 makes it especially appealing for families, kids, or those upgrading from an older ‌iPad‌. For many users, the extra $250 to buy the ‌iPad Air‌ is not justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the ‌iPad Air‌ is for users who want noticeably more performance and versatility. Its M3 chip is noticeably faster and supports things the A16 doesn't, such as hardware-accelerated ray tracing and ProRes video encoding/decoding. That makes it far more suitable for video editing, high-end gaming, working with large documents, running creative apps like Affinity Photo or Logic Pro, or even writing code. It also supports ‌Apple Intelligence‌, so if you want the latest AI features such as writing tools or Genmoji, as well as anything Apple brings to ‌Apple Intelligence‌ in the future, the Air is the better choice.\n\nThe display is fully laminated, which eliminates the gap between your ‌Apple Pencil‌ and the screen, making writing and drawing feel more natural—especially important if you're using ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro, which also brings extra features like barrel roll and haptic feedback. The 13-inch model offers significantly more screen real estate for multitasking, side-by-side apps, or content creation. It also supports ‌Stage Manager‌, allowing true multi-window multitasking with resizable windows and external display support.\n\nIf you're planning to use the ‌iPad‌ for productivity tasks or want something that feels more like a laptop alternative, the ‌iPad Air‌ is likely the better choice. Its starting price is $599 (or $799 for the 13-inch), so it is a more substantial investment—but one that makes sense for users who will take advantage of its more advanced capabilities."}

Luka Doncic returns to Dallas for the first time following his blockbuster trade to the Lakers in February, in what should be a highly charged atmosphere at American Airlines Center.\n\nAnother key game Wednesday is the Sacramento Kings hosting the Denver Nuggets (ESPN, 10:30 p.m. ET), who'll be taking the court for the first time since Tuesday's firing of Michael Malone as coach. Denver's stunning move -- the second late-season firing of an NBA coach -- leaves one of the strongest teams in the Western Conference, led by MVP candidate Nikola Jokic, with an uncertain future.\n\nAmid that, top playoff contenders are aiming to lock up their postseason spots, while teams at the bottom of the standings (notably the Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards) will await their fate for the No. 1 pick.\n\nAhead of the final days of the regular season, our NBA insiders break down whether each team met or missed preseason expectations in our last edition of the season's Power Rankings.\n\nNote: Team rankings are based on where members of our panel (ESPN's Tim Bontemps, Jamal Collier, Michael Wright, Tim MacMahon, Dave McMenamin, Ohm Youngmisuk and Chris Herring) think teams belong this season.\n\nPrevious rankings: Preseason | Oct. 30 | Nov. 5 | Nov. 13 | Nov. 20 | Nov. 27 | Dec. 4 | Dec. 11 | Dec. 18 | Dec. 25 | Jan. 1 | Jan. 8 | Jan. 15 | Jan. 22 | Jan. 29 | Feb. 5 | Feb. 12 | Feb. 26 | March 5 | March 12 | March 19 | March 26 | April 2\n\nA majority of the Western Conference playoff seeding will come down to the last day of the regular season Sunday.

Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n2024-25 record: 65-14\n\nPrevious ranking: 1\n\nNext games: @ PHX (April 9), @ UTAH (April 11), @ NO (April 13)\n\nThe Thunder have earned the West's No. 1 seed for the second consecutive postseason and could make it three in a row in 2026 with a very similar roster after the summer. Oklahoma City has 15 players under contract for next season, including point guard Nikola Topic, a lottery pick who has spent his rookie year recovering from a knee injury. The Thunder could have as many as three first-round picks in this year's draft, but the odds are that the protected picks owed by the 76ers and Heat won't convey this year. -- Tim MacMahon\n\n2. Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n2024-25 record: 63-16\n\nPrevious ranking: 2\n\nNext games: @ IND (April 10), @ NYK (April 11), vs. IND (April 13)\n\nIt was a banner year for the Cavs, securing the second-most wins in franchise history (and their first 60-win season that didn't involve LeBron James) and clinching the No. 1 seed in the East. Under first-year coach Kenny Atkinson -- who'll receive strong consideration for Coach of the Year -- Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland and Evan Mobley each had All-Star seasons. Now they'll need a deep postseason run -- to the conference finals at least -- to validate their success thus far. -- Dave McMenamin\n\n3. Boston Celtics\n\n2024-25 record: 59-20\n\nPrevious ranking: 3\n\nNext games: @ ORL (April 9), vs. CHA (April 11), vs. CHA (April 13)\n\nBoston is right where it hoped to be entering the season: sitting among the top spots in the East standings with a healthy roster and as the favorites to defend its championship title. It's far from assured the Celtics will make it through the next two months and win the title, but things couldn't have gone much better in Boston this season. Jayson Tatum is scoring 26.9 points per game and Finals-MVP co-star Jaylen Brown is right behind him averaging 22.5. -- Tim Bontemps\n\n4. Houston Rockets\n\n2024-25 record: 52-27\n\nPrevious ranking: 4\n\nNext games: @ LAC (April 9), @ LAL (April 11), vs. DEN (April 13)\n\nThe Rockets made good on their stated goal of advancing to the postseason for the first time since the 2019-20 season and Ime Udoka deserves Coach of the Year consideration for his role in shifting the culture in Houston. In addition to bringing in veterans such as Dillon Brooks and Fred VanVleet, Udoka was adamant in his vision to build a tough, physical team that emphasized defense and hustle. That helped Houston improve on its 41 wins from last season and surpass the 50-win mark this time. Internally, the Rockets are pleased with the development of young players such as Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun, and Amen Thompson. How Houston performs in the playoffs will determine the route the club will take this offseason. VanVleet has a team option next season ($44.8 million) but a restricted new deal would add flexibility for a franchise teeming with assets and pondering whether to add a big-name star. -- Michael Wright\n\n5. New York Knicks\n\nEditor's Picks Nikola Jokic's shrinking prime -- and the disconnect brewing inside Denver trying to salvage it Ramona Shelburne\n\nUpdated NBA mock draft: Two rounds, 59 picks and landing spots for tourney stars Jonathan Givony and Jeremy Woo\n\nLeBron James, Luka Doncic and the one player who could swing the playoffs for the Lakers Dave McMenamin 2 Related\n\n2024-25 record: 50-29\n\nPrevious ranking: 11\n\nNext games: @ DET (April 10), vs. CLE (April 11), @ BKN (April 13)\n\nBy winning at least 50 games for the second consecutive season and finishing near their preseason over/under win total of 53.5, New York has essentially met its preseason expectations to be one of the East's best teams. But it'd also be fair to feel as if this new-look group hasn't done enough against elite competition. The club's 0-9 mark against Cleveland, Boston and Oklahoma City -- the teams with the NBA's three best records -- raises questions about whether the Knicks can be competitive beyond the first round of the playoffs. -- Chris Herring\n\n6. Los Angeles Lakers\n\n2024-25 record: 48-31\n\nPrevious ranking: 6\n\nNext games: @ DAL (April 9), vs. HOU (April 11), @ POR (April 13)\n\nThe 2024-25 Lakers season will be forever known for L.A.'s vice president of basketball operations and general manager, Rob Pelinka, pulling off one of the most shocking trades in league history after acquiring Luka Doncic from the Mavericks. Everything else that goes their way will be a bonus. And there has been a lot in the bonus column: JJ Redick proving himself as a first-year head coach, Austin Reaves' continued development and LeBron James still winning the battle against Father Time as a 40-year-old. -- McMenamin\n\n7. Denver Nuggets\n\n2024-25 record: 47-32\n\nPrevious ranking: 5\n\nNext games: @ SAC (April 9), vs. MEM (April 11), @ HOU (April 13)\n\nNuggets ownership made a seismic change on Tuesday by parting ways with both coach Michael Malone and general manager Calvin Booth. Instead of waiting until the end of the season, ownership made the moves with the hopes that the team could still do something this postseason amid a career year from Nikola Jokic. Sources said a \"cold war\" had been going on between Malone and Booth, especially over roster personnel with Booth preferring that Malone play younger role players more. The team not only had to deal with that rift but with key injuries to Aaron Gordon and Jamal Murray. With Denver going 11-13 since All-Star weekend, interim head coach David Adelman, a well-regarded coach who has drawn interviews for head coaching vacancies around the league, takes over. As the offensive mind on the Nuggets' sideline, Adelman will have to figure out how to help Jokic but, more importantly, shore up a bottom-10 defense. -- Ohm Youngmisuk\n\n8. Indiana Pacers\n\n2024-25 record: 48-31\n\nPrevious ranking: 8\n\nNext games: vs. WAS (April 8), vs. CLE (April 10), vs. ORL (April 11), @ CLE (April 13)\n\nIndiana is closing in on locking up the No. 4 seed in the East, a strong and successful campaign following an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals last season, especially considering the Pacers were under .500 at the start of January. Tyrese Haliburton has looked like a star in the second half of the season and Indiana will likely have homecourt in the first round of the playoffs, giving them a more favorable path toward another deep run in the postseason. -- Jamal Collier\n\n9. LA Clippers\n\n2024-25 record: 47-32\n\nPrevious ranking: 12\n\nNext games: vs. HOU (April 9), @ SAC (April 11), @ GS (April 13)\n\nThe Clippers came into the season with the lowest expectations of the Kawhi Leonard era. They opened the Intuit Dome with Leonard's status as a mystery as he rehabbed his right knee for the first couple of months. And with Paul George leaving for Philadelphia in free agency and Russell Westbrook traded to Utah for Kris Dunn and eventually joining the Nuggets, the Clippers retooled the roster with young, hard-nosed, defensive-minded players. But they also hired Jeff Van Gundy as an assistant coach, which proved to be one of the best additions in the NBA. Still, team owner Steve Ballmer boasted that they would be a playoff contender, and Leonard told ESPN he can win with this roster. The Clippers backed that up with a top-five defense and a veteran core -- James Harden, Ivica Zubac and Norman Powell -- that had big seasons. Of course, the biggest question still has to be answered in the playoffs -- can Leonard stay healthy when it matters most? -- Youngmisuk\n\n10. Golden State Warriors\n\n2024-25 record: 47-32\n\nPrevious ranking: 7\n\nNext games: vs. SA (April 9), @ POR (April 11), vs. LAC (April 13)\n\nThe Warriors opened with a 12-3 start that raised expectations significantly despite the summer departure of Klay Thompson. But Golden State then went 13-21, which prompted the bold trade for Jimmy Butler III. That rejuvenated Stephen Curry and Draymond Green and raised the levels of role players such as Brandin Podziemski and Moses Moody. Now the Warriors prepare for a run like in 2022, when they last won the title on the strength of their championship experience and favorable matchups in the postseason. Curry and Green believe they have a legitimate chance at winning a fifth championship as Butler aims for his first, even if that doesn't take place this postseason. But if \"Playoff Jimmy\" shows up, Golden State will be a team no contender will want to face, especially in the early rounds. -- Youngmisuk\n\n11. Minnesota Timberwolves\n\n2024-25 record: 46-33\n\nPrevious ranking: 10\n\nNext games: @ MEM (April 10), vs. BKN (April 11), vs. UTAH (April 13)\n\nThe Wolves aspired to remain a championship contender despite trading franchise player Karl-Anthony Towns weeks before the start of the season. Up until a recent second-half season spark, the Wolves looked anything but playoff-ready. Minnesota was on a five-game winning streak before its devastating loss to the Bucks on Tuesday but are 14-4 since the start of March. It hasn't been the smoothest season, and the Wolves are still fighting to stay out of the Western Conference play-in tournament but they're gaining momentum at the right time to give themselves the best chance in the postseason. -- Collier\n\n12. Memphis Grizzlies\n\n2024-25 record: 47-32\n\nPrevious ranking: 9\n\nNext games: vs. MIN (April 10), @ DEN (April 11), vs. DAL (April 13)\n\nThe playoffs would have provided the perfect proving ground for the new, innovative offense Memphis executed for most of the regular season. The expectation was that the Grizzlies would be less predictable in an offense that virtually eliminated ball screens and dribble handoffs. But the surprise firing of coach Taylor Jenkins last week pushed the Grizzlies in a new direction in their attempt to optimize guard Ja Morant under interim coach Tuomas Iisalo. A string of 10 losses in 17 outings from Feb. 23 to March 27 appeared to seal Jenkins' fate. Now general manager Zach Kleiman seeks \"clarity and direction\" from the team as it closes out the season. In addition to likely conducting a coaching search, Memphis could be eyeing a hefty extension for Jaren Jackson Jr. that could turn out to be a supermax. Still, Memphis is in an advantageous financial position this offseason to upgrade the overall roster. -- Wright\n\n13. Milwaukee Bucks\n\n2024-25 record: 45-34\n\nPrevious ranking: 14\n\nNext games: vs. NO (April 10), @ DET (April 11), vs. DET (April 13)\n\nThe Bucks entered the season with championship expectations, but they haven't been able to contend with the top teams or win consistently enough to look the part all season. They started 2-8, rebounded to win the NBA Cup in December, but recently have faded to the bottom half of the East playoff standings. Overall, Milwaukee went 0-9 against the top three seeds in the East and will need a strong final week, especially in their last two games against the Pistons, which will go a long way in deciding which team enters the playoffs as the No. 6 seed. -- Collier\n\n14.

The Pistons have already beaten their over/under win total by 17.5 games, with three to play in the regular season. Just two teams this century have surpassed their total by more than 20 games: the 2013-14 Suns (27.5) and the 2009-10 Bucks (20.5). Not to mention first-time All-Star Cade Cunningham has taken a huge leap forward in his fourth season that makes him a strong contender for Most Improved Player. -- Kevin Pelton\n\n15. Orlando Magic\n\n2024-25 record: 39-40\n\nPrevious ranking: 18\n\nNext games: vs. BOS (April 9), @ IND (April 11), @ ATL (April 13)\n\nTuesday's win over the Hawks means Orlando can clinch the top seed in the play-in before finishing the season Sunday in Atlanta. It's tough to say how much of the Magic's slide from the fifth seed in the 2024 postseason to the play-in this season can be explained by injuries. Orlando has played a combined 54 games without leading scorers Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner, but the Magic are still below .500 when both play. This could be explained by the absence of point guard Jalen Suggs, who's out for the season after undergoing knee surgery. One bright spot for Orlando: Reserve guard Caleb Houstan has been on a hot streak, shooting 53% on 3s since the All-Star break. -- Pelton\n\n16. Sacramento Kings\n\n2024-25 record: 39-40\n\nPrevious ranking: 17\n\nNext games: vs. Den (April 9), vs. LAC (April 11), vs. PHX (April 13)\n\nThe Suns' loss on Tuesday locked up a play-in spot for the Kings but Sacramento is still playing for the right to host the 9-10 game, which would match where the team finished last year. Expectations ran higher after Sacramento added free agent DeMar DeRozan, and coach Mike Brown took the fall for his team's uneven start in December. Things haven't been much different under interim coach Doug Christie, which led the Kings to deal star De'Aaron Fox for Zach LaVine before the deadline. A play-in loss could mean even more changes this summer. -- Pelton\n\n17. Dallas Mavericks\n\n2024-25 record: 38-41\n\nPrevious ranking: 16\n\nNext games: vs. LAL (April 9), vs. TOR (April 11), @ MEM (April 13)\n\nThe Mavs are fighting for the right to host the West's 9/10 play-in game, which isn't a position they planned on occupying after acquiring Anthony Davis and Max Christie in the Luka Doncic trade. But injuries have wreaked havoc on the Dallas roster, including a torn ACL that ended star guard Kyrie Irving's season and will likely sideline him for a significant portion of the 2025-26 season. There is a lot of intrigue around the league about Irving's contractual situation this summer. He has a $44 million player option, and several league sources anticipated before his injury that the Mavs would lock up Irving for three years at near maximum money. -- MacMahon\n\n18. Atlanta Hawks\n\n2024-25 record: 37-42\n\nPrevious ranking: 15\n\nNext games: @ BKN (April 10), @ PHI (April 11), vs. ORL (April 13)\n\nThe Hawks had ridden a few high moments throughout this season's campaign, including knocking off the East's top three teams -- the Cavs, Celtics and Knicks -- en route to reaching the NBA Cup semifinals. But all in all, they've landed back where they've been for four consecutive years now: in the play-in, fighting for a spot in the playoffs. Their 37 wins, a one-game improvement from last season, are just above their 35.5 over/under projection. -- Chris Herring\n\n19.

Accepting that reality is why Miami chose to trade Butler before the deadline to Golden State. The biggest question is what the Heat will do to take a step forward next season rather than remain in the same position again. -- Bontemps\n\n20. Chicago Bulls\n\n2024-25 record: 36-43\n\nPrevious ranking: 19\n\nNext games: vs. MIA (April 9), vs. WAS (April 11), @ PHI (April 13)\n\nDespite claiming to be in a transition phase, the Bulls are heading to the East play-in tournament for the third consecutive season. Chicago is not a threat to make a deep playoff run, but a late-season surge from Josh Giddey and Coby White has given the Bulls a semblance of the future. But without a star and no clear path on how to acquire one, the ceiling on the Bulls still seems low for the future. -- Collier\n\n21. Phoenix Suns\n\n2024-25 record: 35-44\n\nPrevious ranking: 20\n\nNext games: vs. OKC (April 9), vs. SA (April 11), @ SAC (April 13)\n\nPhoenix came into the season with an over/under betting line of 48.5 wins and will need to win the final three games just to win 38. It has been a disastrous season for the Suns, who have followed up an NBA Finals run in 2021 by firing two coaches (Monty Williams and Frank Vogel) and are falling flat with a third in Mike Budenholzer. A seven-game losing streak has done all but dash their chances of claiming a spot in the play-in tournament, but the bigger question remains: What will the organization and Kevin Durant do this summer? -- McMenamin\n\n22. Portland Trail Blazers\n\n2024-25 record: 35-44\n\nPrevious ranking: 22\n\nNext games: @ UTAH (April 9), vs. GS (April 11), vs. LAL (April 13)\n\nDespite winning Sunday, the Blazers were mathematically eliminated from play-in contention. That Portland had something to play for through April was unexpected coming into the season, and GM Joe Cronin was rewarded Monday for the team's performance and the development of young foundation players Deni Avdija and Toumani Camara with a multiyear contract extension. The next decision for the Blazers is on coach Chauncey Billups, who has a team option for 2025-26. Sean Highkin of Rose Garden Report indicated Monday that Portland has yet to exercise the option. -- Pelton\n\n23. San Antonio Spurs\n\n2024-25 record: 32-47\n\nPrevious ranking: 24\n\nNext games: @ GS (April 9), @ PHX (April 11), vs. TOR (April 13)\n\nSan Antonio wanted to emphasize the development of winning habits during Victor Wembanyama's rookie season so that it could make a legitimate run at the postseason during the French phenom's second-year campaign. A series of events prevented those lofty expectations from coming to fruition. Hall of Fame coach Gregg Popovich suffered a stroke five games into the season that has indefinitely sidelined him, leaving assistant Mitch Johnson in charge. The front office shrewdly maneuvered to acquire speedy guard De'Aaron Fox near the trade deadline, but he played just five games with Wembanyama before the latter was shelved for the season due to a blood clot in his right shoulder. The club also shut down Fox so that he could undergo surgery to repair a tendon on his left hand. San Antonio has a lottery pick and an additional first-rounder in the upcoming draft but also faces uncertainty regarding Popovich's potential return. -- Wright\n\n24. Toronto Raptors\n\n2024-25 record: 29-50\n\nPrevious ranking: 25\n\nNext games: vs. CHA (April 9), @ DAL (April 11), @ SA (April 13)\n\nInjuries curtailed Toronto's chances of being a potential play-in team, but by landing in the top half of the lottery, the Raptors are positioned to immediately leap back into the playoff picture next season. They'll also be able to count on Brandon Ingram, who was acquired from New Orleans in February but has not played since Dec. 7 due to an ankle injury. How high this group's long-term ceiling is, however, will come down to where this year's draft pick lands. -- Bontemps\n\n25. Brooklyn Nets\n\n2024-25 record: 26-53\n\nPrevious ranking: 26\n\nNext games: vs. ATL (April 10), @ MIN (April 11), vs. NYK (April 13)\n\nBrooklyn surpassed its over/under projection of 19.5 in early February, a big sign that the Nets exceeded expectations. Back in possession of their own 2025 draft pick, the Nets were widely expected to be in a rebuilding mode. Still, first-year coach Jordi Fernandez kept the group highly competitive despite the team trading players such as Dennis Schroder and Dorian Finney-Smith, and even as leading scorer Cam Thomas played in just 25 games before exiting for the remainder of the season with a left strained hamstring. Now their eyes are set on the lottery as they wait to see where they will pick and how they will add to their young roster. -- Chris Herring\n\n26. Philadelphia 76ers\n\n2024-25 record: 23-56\n\nPrevious ranking: 27\n\nNext games: @ WAS (April 9), vs. ATL (April 11), vs. CHI (April 13)\n\nTo say this season has been a disaster in Philadelphia is an understatement. A team that had championship aspirations after acquiring Paul George in the offseason has been out of the playoff picture for months. It has struggled so much that the unthinkable has happened: The 76ers could keep their top-six protected pick from conveying to the Thunder, depending on how the pingpong balls fall next month in the lottery. -- Bontemps\n\n27. New Orleans Pelicans\n\n2024-25 record: 21-58\n\nPrevious ranking: 23\n\nNext games: @ MIL (April 10), vs. MIA (April 11), vs. OKC (April 13)\n\nOffseason addition Dejounte Murray fractured his left hand in a season-opening win against Chicago, tipping off what would be a vicious wave of injuries for a team that lost 16 of its first 20 games. The vaunted trio of Murray, Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram never stepped foot on the court together, with Ingram traded to Toronto in February. In all, the Pelicans lost Murray, Ingram, Williamson, Trey Murphy III, Herbert Jones and Jose Alvarado at some point to either season-ending or prolonged injuries. The club also shut down CJ McCollum for the season. So, consider this a lost season for New Orleans -- and there's still a chance Murray and Murphy will miss the start of next season -- as it recovers from injuries. New Orleans could be making its first top-five selection in the upcoming draft since taking Williamson in 2019 with the No. 1 pick. Overall roster health and continuing to build around Williamson appear to be the Pels' top priorities in the offseason. -- Wright\n\n28. Charlotte Hornets\n\n2024-25 record: 19-60\n\nPrevious ranking: 28\n\nNext games: @ TOR (April 9), @ BOS (April 11), @ BOS (April 13)\n\nThere certainly weren't playoff expectations for this season, but with Charlotte being a full 10 games below its preseason over/under of 29.5, it's fair to call this injury-riddled season another forgettable one for the Hornets. They could be faced with some difficult questions in the offseason. Chief among them: Is 23-year-old LaMelo Ball, who had a career-high usage rate on career-low shooting percentages, still the player the franchise wants to build around? This season marked the third time in his five-year career that he played in fewer than 50 games. -- Herring\n\n29. Washington Wizards\n\n2024-25 record: 17-62\n\nPrevious ranking: 29\n\nNext games: vs. PHI (April 9), @ CHI (April 11), @ MIA (April 13)\n\nThe Wizards entered the season with the excitement surrounding the No. 2 pick in Alex Sarr and fellow first-round picks Bub Carrington and Kyshawn George. But there was never any question that this was another year in the building process. And with this draft touted as a deep one, Washington's primary goal was to continue to develop young building blocks like Bilal Coulibaly, keep adding assets when possible and get the highest pick possible in the lottery. They also added vets like Khris Middleton and Marcus Smart to help mentor their youngsters as well. Losing 60-plus games for a second straight year is painful. But if Washington wins the lottery or has a top-three pick, it'll ease the pain. -- Youngmisuk\n\n30. Utah Jazz\n\n2024-25 record: 16-63\n\nPrevious ranking: 30\n\nNext games: vs. POR (April 9), vs. OKC (April 11), @ MIN (April 13)\n\nAfter pushing the limits of the player participation policy all season, the Jazz will be sweating out the results of the draft lottery. Utah, which is projected to be one of the three teams with the maximum 14% odds for the No. 1 pick, desperately needs to land a player who can be a franchise centerpiece. The Jazz didn't unload any of their veterans before this season's trade deadline, but they will have those discussions again this summer as the franchise operates with a long-term view in mind. -- MacMahon"}

Scale bars, 2.0 mm (a, b), 0.5 mm (c). Credit: Yang Dinghua\n\nA research team from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has identified a fossil acanthocephalan, Juracanthocephalus, from the 160-million-year-old Daohugou Biota in Inner Mongolia, China. This finding was published in Nature.\n\nAcanthocephalans, commonly known as thorny-headed or spiny-headed worms, are a group of endoparasitic worms found in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. These medically significant parasites infect a wide range of hosts, including humans, pigs, dogs, cats, and fish.\n\nAcanthocephalans are characterized by their worm-like body shape and a retractable proboscis armed with rows of recurved (i.e., backward-facing) hooks for anchoring to the digestive tracts of their hosts. Historically classified as a distinct animal phylum, their highly specialized body plan has led to ongoing debates regarding their phylogenetic position.\n\nMorphological studies have proposed various hypotheses linking acanthocephalans to Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Priapulida (penis worms), or Rotifera (wheel animals). However, molecular phylogenetic analyses strongly suggest that acanthocephalans are a highly specialized subgroup within Rotifera. Despite this, the morphological disparity between endoparasitic acanthocephalans and free-living rotifers remains striking.\n\nThe backscatter scanning electron (BSE) image (a), overlay image of several elements concentrations (b) and elemental maps of carbon from energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (c) of Juracanthocephalus. Scale bar, 2.0 mm. Credit: NIGPAS\n\nFurthermore, the fossil record of acanthocephalans is exceptionally sparse due to their soft bodies—which were less likely to fossilize than harder ones—and concealed habitats.\n\nUntil now, the only known fossil evidence consisted of four putative acanthocephalan eggs discovered in the coprolites of a Late Cretaceous crocodyliform. Due to the lack of body fossils, the origin and early evolution of acanthocephalans thus remain poorly understood.\n\nUsing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), the research team conducted a detailed anatomical analysis of Juracanthocephalus and updated the morphological matrix of worm-like animals to support a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis.\n\nThe results indicate that Juracanthocephalus represents a transitional form between free-living, jawed rotifers and jawless, endoparasitic acanthocephalans, bridging an evolutionary gap. This finding provides the first direct fossil evidence to help resolve the long-standing mystery of acanthocephalan origins.\n\nSimplified cladogram of Gnathifera showing Juracanthocephalus in red color. Credit: NIGPAS\n\nJuracanthocephalus has a fusiform body divided into a proboscis, neck, and trunk. The proboscis is equipped with strongly sclerotized, slightly curved hooks, while the ventral surface of the trunk features 38 lines of transverse, setaceous combs—a trait comparable to modern acanthocephalans.\n\nA possible alimentary tract is preserved in the proboscis, though no clear gut is visible in the trunk. The terminal end of the fossil displays a structure resembling the bursa of male acanthocephalans.\n\nNotably, Juracanthocephalus has a jaw apparatus composed of clustered, tooth-like units arranged in converging paired rows, with the jaws increasing in size posteriorly. This structure closely resembles that found in Gnathifera, a group that includes Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and Syndermata (which encompasses Rotifera and Acanthocephala).\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter—daily or weekly.\n\nTo determine the phylogenetic position of Juracanthocephalus, the research team compiled an updated morphological matrix incorporating both extant and extinct worm-like animals.\n\nThe analysis identifies Juracanthocephalus as a stem-group acanthocephalan, sister to all extant acanthocephalans. This finding aligns with molecular phylogenetic analyses, which place acanthocephalans within Rotifera (including Monogononta, Bdelloidea, and Seisonidea).\n\nPhylogenetic tree from 50% majority rule bootstrap consensus tree of parsimony analysis. When Juracanthocephalus is included in the matrix, the results recover Seisonidea as the sister group to Juracanthocephalus + all extant acanthocephalans (a); when Juracanthocephalus is excluded from the morphological matrix, the results support the Seisonidea as the sister group of all other Rotifera (b). Credit: NIGPAS\n\nHowever, the precise placement of acanthocephalans within Rotifera remains contentious, with six competing hypotheses arising from molecular and morphological studies. When Juracanthocephalus is excluded from the morphological matrix, the results support Seisonidea as the sister group to all other Rotifera, consistent with previous morphological analyses but conflicting with molecular data.\n\nConversely, incorporating Juracanthocephalus into the matrix positions Seisonidea as the sister group to Juracanthocephalus and all extant acanthocephalans, reconciling morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses.\n\nThe discovery of Juracanthocephalus provides a crucial reference for understanding the evolutionary innovations and body plan of acanthocephalans. Its hooked proboscis and large body size suggest that it was an endoparasite during the Jurassic period. Furthermore, this fossil implies that acanthocephalans may have originated in terrestrial environments and diverged from Rotifera no later than the Middle Jurassic.\n\nThis study underscores the importance of transitional fossils in elucidating radical morphological changes in animal body plans.

It has been named “The Mar-A-Lago Accord”, a concept inspired by the Plaza Accord of 1985, which aimed to devalue the US dollar to address trade imbalances. That plan failed.\n\nThe objective, according to the financial media, would be to weaken the US dollar, boost US export competitiveness, and rebalance global trade. Another proposal involves restructuring US debt by swapping existing obligations for longer-term bonds, such as 100-year Treasury bonds, to ease fiscal pressures. However, this would be a dangerous and potentially counterproductive idea.\n\nThe Mar-A-Lago Accord concept starts from two wrong premises, which are to believe that US exports are not large enough due to a strong currency and that debt is too high because of a robust US dollar. Both are simply incorrect.\n\nUS exports are relatively low compared to other nations, at 11% of GDP, compared to 42% for Germany, 29% for the UK, or 21% for Japan, for example. However, the main reasons for the US’s relatively small exports have nothing to do with the currency. The United States is an enormous market, and domestic businesses do not need to export to strengthen their earnings and sales. It is also rich in natural resources, which makes it relatively self-sufficient, reducing the need for imports and, by extension, limiting the incentive to export. The United States is the largest oil and gas producer in the world, and the estimated value of its natural resources is approximately $45 trillion. Furthermore, with 331 million people in 2023, consumer spending accounts for approximately 70% of the U.S. GDP.\n\nThe United States is one of the largest markets in the world, but more importantly, it is the richest. Median individual consumer spending is much higher than in countries like China or India, and the top third of the income distribution accounts for about 56% of spending. At $5 trillion in 2024, it is the largest retail market in the world. Furthermore, the United States economy is mostly a services economy. Services, including professional and business services, are more difficult to export, and the size and wealth of the domestic market make it unnecessary to sell abroad in most cases.\n\nManufacturing in the United States is not small, at 10% of GDP, due to a strong domestic currency but due to the burdens imposed by regulation on industries. Furthermore, artificially lowering costs with a weaker currency is a losing formula, as there is always someone else willing to destroy their currency faster.\n\nUS manufacturing cannot compete abroad by destroying the purchasing power of the currency. It means immediate poverty for Americans. It must compete on value-added products, as the technology and other sectors have proven.\n\nSwapping existing short-term debt for long-term bonds is also a terrible idea because it would create the incentive for the government to increase borrowing and not address its structural spending problem. Restructuring debt by forcing an artificial depreciation of the US dollar would also scare bond investors, who would rightly fear that other administrations would resort to the same trick in the future. Why would you buy a 100-year bond from a nation that may devalue its currency regularly every time those debt challenges come back? This proposal is not a tool to keep the US dollar as the world reserve currency but a guarantee of losing its global status.\n\nNone of the United States’ export and debt challenges would improve with a devaluation of the US dollar, and a crucial one would deteriorate: inflation.\n\nThe United States already suffers elevated inflation due to the wrong fiscal and monetary policies. The cumulative inflation of 24% suffered by Americans in the past four years came precisely from the interventionist measures on the quantity and price of money, bloating government spending and debt, which led to a decades-high record money supply growth and, with it, the current inflationary pressures. With a devaluation, prices would immediately rise in US dollars, and the purchasing power of salaries would decline.\n\nDevaluation does not improve productivity or industrial added value, so any decline in costs would translate to the impoverishment of American workers and savers.\n\nDevaluing is a de facto default and the manifestation of the insolvency of a nation.\n\nYou cannot expect to devalue the currency while simultaneously controlling inflation and debt. Devaluation makes the government abandon the necessary adjustment to its spending habits, and the debt sustainability problem resurfaces in a short period of time. Real wages suffer, real consumption weakens, the entire economy is made artificially poorer in US dollars as inflation rises, and only crony sectors and the government benefit because they can perpetuate their inefficiencies and imbalances in an increasingly worthless currency.\n\nDevaluing is not a solution to indebtedness. It incentivizes more borrowing in a government that is already addicted to spending. Furthermore, it worsens the crowding-out effect as government debt displaces private sector credit, which becomes more expensive as the currency weakens and inflation rises.\n\nIf devaluing the currency was a real measure of competitiveness, Argentina and Venezuela would be the most competitive nations on the planet.\n\nDevaluing zombifies a few uncompetitive crony sectors and a fiscally irresponsible government at the expense of making everyone else poorer.\n\nA strong US dollar reduces inflationary pressures and keeps interest rates low. Both effects are positive for savers, workers, and families as the private economy strengthens and real wages improve. A strong US dollar is also positive for the government and companies. Capital and foreign direct investment flow to the US, and corporations and government borrowing costs are kept low by rising demand. Corporations can also make international acquisitions at a cheaper cost, both in lower rates and currency adjustments.\n\nA sound monetary policy and a strong currency are also essential to keep the world reserve currency status. If a small proportion of the US economic sectors suffer from a strong dollar, it is a price worth paying in exchange for being the world’s richest nation, with the most-used currency, a reserve of value, and a worthy investment for the rest of the world.\n\nThe greatest mistake that can be made by the Trump administration is to follow beggar-thy-neighbour devaluation policies to disguise a structural government imbalance.\n\nDevaluation is not a tool for exports. It is a tool for cronyism and always ends with the demise of the currency as a valuable reserve.\n\nThe United States’ problems are complex, and there is no easy fix. It needs to address its excessive regulation and taxation that burden manufacturers, but it also needs to curb government spending and the endless monetary easing that erodes the purchasing power of salaries and makes families and small businesses suffer.\n\nIf the current administration works to defend American jobs, workers’ wages, and families, a strong US dollar is proof that it is achieving its goals.\n\nA strong economy does not need a weak currency."}

The AI-powered research assistant offers a relatively intuitive and focused setup to make custom guides on any topic you can name. It's now poised to become even more accessible with a mobile app soon.\n\nThe app should be exciting for anyone who works with large volumes of information or just has an idiosyncratic learning style. NotebookLM basically takes any text, including Google Docs, PDFs, and even YouTube videos that have a transcript, unifies it, and recontextualizes the result as a summary, study guide, or other presentation.\n\nAs good as NotebookLM's summarization and ability to synthesize notes are, its most memorable aspect is the Audio Overviews it can create. Audio Overviews basically turns all that information you uploaded into a podcast hosted by two AI characters. The synthetic conversation between the two AI hosts can actually sound like people who have read what you uploaded and want to discuss it.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a gimmick, but it's really just a reformatting of information like any other. If you’ve ever felt like you'd absorb details from books and other text better in a BBC panel discussion, it's a great option.\n\nIt's also the most obvious reason to anticipate the NotebookLM mobile app. It’s perfect for multitaskers, commuters, and anyone whose eyes are too tired to stare at another screen. I’ve used it to refresh myself on interview transcripts before writing articles and just as a fun way to explain a confusing topic. When the app hits smartphones, the ability to do this on the go may be huge for anyone who wants to absorb complex information but doesn’t always have the time or focus to read it.\n\nPocket NotebookLM\n\nOf course, Audio Overview is just one part of what makes NotebookLM worth your attention. Unlike many AI assistants, which often operate in a vacuum or require you to explain everything from scratch, NotebookLM has context from the content you share specifically. Its abilities are many, from basic summaries and the ability to answer questions to creating timelines, brainstorming new ideas built on the information, and instant cross-references.\n\nThat's useful on a computer. As a mobile app, there's a lot more opportunity to exploit NotebookLM's tools. Sure, you'll have needed to upload the information, but if it's there, you can instantly pull up that quote you can't quite remember or fact about the person you're about to meet.\n\nOf course, it’s not perfect. NotebookLM is only as smart as the information you give it. If your sources are a mess, it won’t magically fill in the blanks. It also can't replace real research. Sometimes, it misses nuance or answers too confidently when the source it pulls from is hedging. But the fact that it’s transparent about the answers helps compensate. And, at least it will always offer something to listen to on your next long commute."}

For web servers, databases, CPU-based machine learning, and other workloads, the new Google C4D instances deliver incredible uplift compared to the prior-gen C3D instances. Here are some of the first public, independent benchmarks of Google's new C4D family.\n\nThanks to Google for providing Phoronix with early preview access to the new C4D instance type. For being able to carry out this launch-day testing, Google provided gratis/free access to the C4D instance types for performance benchmarking as well as the prior-gen C3D instances for comparison. Thanks to Google for providing this free access to be able to carry out today's benchmarks of 5th Gen AMD EPYC in the public cloud.\n\nGoogle is catering the new EPYC Turin powered instances for web servers, app serving, game servers, databases, caching servers, video streaming, data analytics, CPU-based AI/ML workloads, and more. As we've shown in many Phoronix articles since last year, the AMD EPYC 9005 series offers incredible performance potential. With EPYC Turin using Zen 5 CPU cores there is AVX-512 now implemented with a full 512-bit data path, DDR5-6000/6400 memory support, and a variety of other architectural improvements for delivering great uplift compared to the prior generation EPYC 9004 series. If you've been keeping up with your Phoronix reading and the many 5th Gen EPYC CPU benchmarks on Phoronix since last October, the new EPYC 9005 series really doesn't need any further introduction: these are extremely capable server processors.\n\nThe new Google Cloud C4D instances scale up from 2 to 384 vCPUs using both physical cores and sibling SMT threads. The C4D instances are also available with Confidential VM support leveraging AMD SEV-SNP for those interested.\n\nAt least for the Google C4D instances I tested thus far, they were all powered by the AMD EPYC 9B45 CPU model as a custom SKU offering -- similar to C3D using the AMD EPYC 9B14 processor.\n\nFor getting an idea of the C4D performance, I benchmarked the c4d-standard-32 and c4d-standard-64 instances. In an article next week will also be some flagship benchmarks of the top-end c4d-standard-384 instance. For evaluating the C4D performance I compared them to the c3d-standard-30 and c3d-standard-60 instances: unfortunately there wasn't the same vCPU count matching between C3D and C4D, but even when accounting for the vCPU difference, these Turin-powered C4D instances deliver striking leads.\n\nAll of the C3D and C4D instances were tested using Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with the Linux 6.8 kernel and GCC 13.3 compiler and other OS/package defaults. Thanks again to Google for providing the free access for carrying out these C3D and C4D instances. Due to the public cloud costs otherwise and the pressure on the web ad/publishing industry, just these instances were tested for a generational look without any cross-cloud tests or similar. Those curious how Intel Xeon CPUs compete with AMD EPYC 9005 and the like can see our numerous bare metal CPU benchmarks in Phoronix reviews.\n\nI wasn't provided with any C4D instance pricing information in advance of today's launch so this article is looking strictly at the generational performance from C3D to C4D instances on Google Cloud."}

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nAI is still bad at a lot of things. I encounter hallucinations and inaccurate answers almost every time I use it, so I double-check everything, which takes time. I never believe anything I read on the internet at first glance, anyway. Still, on balance, AI is now saving me so much time and improving my workflow so much that I don’t mind.\n\nThe latest AI models are getting good enough that it’s more than worth it to find ways the software can make your life easier. Fielding your most pressing tax questions is a great example of a job AI can try.\n\nThe tax bots are helpful — and pretty restrained\n\nFor the 2023 tax year, both TurboTax and H&R Block launched AI-powered chatbots to help customers file their taxes. The tools did not impress Washington Post tech columnist Geoffrey Fowler, who called the chatbots “unhelpful” and, more to the point, “awful.” The companies rolled out the tools before they were finished, and they served up plenty of “bad advice,” Fowler said in a review last spring. I believe him, but I also had a different experience testing the tools this time around.\n\nAfter last year’s reported goof-ups, TurboTax and H&R Block updated their tax bots. They appear to be less bad at first glance. Compared to what I know about the original iterations, the second-generation chatbots seem more low-key and less error-prone. When I asked them really hard questions, they referred me back to help documents or to a human agent.\n\nYou might think of the chatbots as a coach. They’re not going to do your taxes, and they’re not supposed to give you inaccurate information. But they are designed to make the process feel less stressful, according to Heather Watts, senior vice president of H&R Block’s DIY tax business.\n\n“What we’ve heard from feedback from users who’ve used it,” Watts told me, “is it’s just giving them that confidence that what they’re doing is accurate, and they feel good about, ultimately, the outcome of their tax refund.”\n\nRelated One quick trick to make AI actually useful\n\nBoth TurboTax and H&R Block power their chatbots with proprietary large language models (LLM), trained on the tax code and their internal help documents. This should, in theory, keep the chatbots from drifting too far from dependable information and already-vetted answers to questions.\n\nWhen I asked H&R Block’s AI Tax Assist software specific questions about itemized deductions or the child tax credit, I got clear, bullet-pointed responses that often didn’t directly answer the question but rather provided generalized information. TurboTax’s AI assistant answered some questions but was quick to refer me to help articles or a live human when the questions got more complicated — which is why I describe them as low-key. They’re generally pretty restrained and conservative in their willingness to give actual advice. They’re not trying too hard to impress you, so they don’t fail too hard either.\n\n“They’re still not great in very complex situations, and I think that will take some time,” said Subodha Kumar, a professor at the Fox School of Business at Temple University. “But they have become very good with simpler cases.”\n\nThey’re not trying too hard to impress you, so they don’t fail too hard either.\n\nWhich is not to say these AI chatbots can never be wrong. If these bots give you bad advice — and they gave Fowler from the Washington Post plenty of it last year — your tax return could get flagged by the government and require an amendment. It could cause some unnecessary stress, at best, and at worst, cost you some money.\n\nBoth TurboTax and H&R Block guarantee accuracy in your finalized tax return. Both companies also tucked access to their chatbots away in the software’s help menu, a couple clicks away from the form where you input your financial info. That leads me to believe that people who find them know what they’re getting themselves into. And people do seem to be discovering and using these tools. TurboTax told me that while only 15 percent of its customers’ questions were answered by AI in 2024, that number has grown to 65 percent this year.\n\nThere are clear disclaimers about the need to proceed with caution on both platforms. A warning label does not make any product safe, but at least it signals something to the user. In this case, you should review all answers the AI provides.\n\nAI is the past and future of accounting\n\nThe tax world is not new to AI. For years, accounting firms and tech companies alike have been incorporating AI tools to automate and streamline the tax-filing process.\n\nTurboTax and H&R Block have already been using AI in the background to give personalized deduction recommendations and to read uploaded documents, including W2s, in order to fill out forms more quickly. Both companies also told me they’re using AI to help check the accuracy of tax returns in real time.\n\nThese kinds of workflows aren’t unique to the tax prep giants. In fact, AI is making everything faster through automation across the accounting industry.\n\n“We use a lot of automations to help save us time,” said Anthony Drozd, the operations manager at Sargent CPAs, a New York-based accounting firm. “If I had to make an educated guess, I would say we’ve saved about 20 percent of our time with automations that wouldn’t have been possible without AI help.”\n\nRelated AI wants to Google for you\n\nThe next wave of AI technology, known as agentic AI, could allow the technology to not only recall information and create content but actually carry out tasks. In other words, AI isn’t currently doing your taxes. But companies like TurboTax and H&R Block are slowly training their models to do more by watching you do your taxes, so that it can automate the process more in the future, and save time and money.\n\nWe don’t know if that agentic AI future will come to pass. In the meantime, some experts think that these AI chatbots can do more harm than good. Even if TurboTax and H&R Block have improved their models, AI chatbots are an unwelcome intermediary between someone looking for accurate information and that information in its original, vetted form, according to Emily M. Bender, a linguistics professor at the University of Washington and the co-author of The AI Con.\n\n“You end up with something that looks like a cost-cutting measure or looks like a convenient shortcut, and at the same time, it devalues the work of the people who actually do that stuff,” Bender said.\n\nIndeed, some in the tax industry are leaning away from the chatbot approach and appealing to the demand for a personal touch. Ernst & Young, for instance, advertises its lack of a chatbot as a reason to pay for its services over the competitors. Taxes are stressful, so why worry about the reliability of the advice you got from an AI chatbot, which is effectively just a sophisticated autocomplete software program.\n\nThe thing my accountant had missed was no big deal. It ended up not affecting my return this year, but my accountant later told me he was glad I flagged it. And I was glad to have a human there to help me feel a little less scared about tax season."}

The stumbling block has been in the postseason, where Harbaugh hasn't led Baltimore to a Super Bowl since winning it in the 2012 season.\n\nHarbaugh is proud of what the Ravens have been able to accomplish, but he has been left unfulfilled lately.\n\n\"I feel like I have a lot more to prove,\" Harbaugh said. \"Our team has a lot more to prove, and I feel like I have a lot of good ideas, and our group has a lot of good ideas. We're still growing, big time. I just feel like there's no stopping us, and I can't wait to try this stuff out next year. As long as I feel that way, I think I'm going to keep coaching.\"\n\nHarbaugh has come a long way since 2008, when the Ravens hired him despite no previous head coaching experience. At the time, he was the ninth-youngest coach in the NFL.\n\nNow at 62, he is currently the third-oldest. The only coaches who are older are the Las Vegas Raiders' Pete Carroll (73) and the Kansas City Chiefs' Andy Reid (67).\n\nExcited about what the Ravens can achieve with a talent-filled roster, Harbaugh indicated thoughts of retirement is not front of mind. He then shared the best advice about calling it quits.\n\n\"Hey, you coach, until you just can't take it anymore.\" Harbaugh recalled the words of his father, Jack, who coached over a span of five decades. \"When you get to that point, you coach for two more years and then you move on.\"\n\nHarbaugh's extension puts him in a position to be among the all-time greats in terms of longevity. He is under contract through the 2028 season, which would mark his 21st in the league. According to ESPN Research, only six coaches in NFL history have spent 20 or more seasons with one team: Curly Lambeau (29 years with the Green Bay Packers), Tom Landry (29 with the Dallas Cowboys), Don Shula (26 with the Miami Dolphins), Bill Belichick (24 with the New England Patriots), Chuck Noll (23 with the Pittsburgh Steelers) and Steve Owen (23 with the New York Giants).\n\nHarbaugh is also establishing a new Baltimore sports mark this year. He will surpass Earl Weaver, who managed the Orioles for 17 seasons (1968-82 and 1985-86), for the city's longest run by a pro coach or manager.\n\n\"He's been so steady,\" Ravens president Sashi Brown said. \"He's helped us really establish 'the Ravens' way.'\"\n\nHarbaugh turned the Ravens into a perennial Super Bowl contender. He became the first coach in NFL history to advance to three conference championship games in his first five seasons."}

Forward generated $308 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2024.\n\nLiquidity is expected to improve by $10 million to $392 million sequentially in the first quarter. The company ended the year at a 5.5 times net leverage ratio. It isn’t required to meet the 5.5 times threshold until the fourth quarter of 2026 per its new debt covenant.\n\nForward’s revenue mix has changed after the January 2024 acquisition of freight forwarder Omni Logistics. Some investors tried to block the transaction given the high debt burden that would need to be assumed. Even Forward attempted to break the deal after pressure from shareholders mounted.\n\nThe company is currently conducting a strategic review assessing all options, which include a potential sale.\n\nShares of FWRD closed Tuesday at $10.50, down 67% on the year and 91% lower than when the Omni deal was announced in August 2023. The stock was off 3.2% in early trading on Wednesday compared to the S&P 500, which was up 0.8%.\n\nMore FreightWaves articles by Todd Maiden:\n\nThe post Forward Air flags 10% to 15% revenue impact from new tariffs appeared first on FreightWaves."}

Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nLet’s be frank: Linkind’s smart bulbs won’t blow you away with their unprecedented feature set, amazing color quality, or even their support for Matter. What will impress is their biggest selling point: Their price tag, which at the time of this review was an amazing value at a less than $20 for a pack of four. While you’ll occasionally see other brands on sale at around that point or even a few cents less, that’s about as cheap as it gets for a full-color, tunable-white Wi-Fi bulb right now.\n\nThe bulb hardware itself offers zero surprises, presented as a standard A19 bulb with a large white heat sink beneath an Edison-style globe. The bulb features RGBTW LEDs—red, green, blue, and tunable white—with a white color temperatures ranging from an exceptionally warm 1800 Kelvin to a very cool 6500K. The bulb draws a maximum of 9 watts while putting out 800 lumens, equivalent to a 60-watt incandescent bulb.\n\nLinkind’s light quality looks fine, the bulb dims smoothly, and the cost per bulb is amazingly low.\n\nNeed other form factors? The bulbs are available in additional shapes and sizes, including BR30 floodlights and slightly taller A21 Edison bulbs, as well as light strips. Tunable and dimmable white-only bulbs are also an option if you don’t need color and want to save even more cash.\n\nLinkind’s A19 smart bulbs deliver higher quality light than you might expect for the bargain-basement price. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nInstallation and setup\n\nConfiguration is done through an app called AiDot (the name of Linkind’s parent company), and smart lighting users will find this to be a fairly familiar tool, albeit one with a slightly quirky interface. Bulbs are added by scanning a QR code printed both on the manual and the bulb itself, with the former being much more convenient if you’ve already socketed the bulb. Note that this QR code is labeled as a Matter code, but it works for both Matter connections and in AiDot’s own ecosystem.\n\nI had only one slight hiccup during initial configuration, as the app could not locate the bulb; but this turned out to be because I did not have the appropriate Bluetooth permissions turned on in iOS. A close reading of the error message received during the setup process will alert you to this. Oddly, it’s something I’ve never encountered previously.\n\nYou’ll find all the color-tuning settings you’d expect in the AiDot app. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nWith Bluetooth permissions properly enabled, I was able to quickly onboard the bulb to the AiDot app, bridge it to my 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network (5GHz networks are not supported), and begin managing it normally, though you’ll need to deal with a minor barrage of email messages to set up your account. The AiDot app has the usual features, though the layout again can be a little unintuitive.\n\nYou’ll find white light settings confusingly under the “Color” menu item, for example. A full color wheel lets you choose your ideal shade, or you can move over to the “Presets” menu to choose from dozens of dynamic color-shifting modes. As with most color-shifting systems, some of these are more interesting than others, so you’ll need to experiment to find the ones that look the best in your environment. As well, a “DIY” mode lets you choose your own colors and effects if you want to get deep into tinkering.\n\nThe Linkind bulb includes a final mode—“Music”—which uses your phone’s microphone to shift color and brightness in tune with ambient sound. Again, this is highly tunable based on how bright or kinetic you want the color changes to be.\n\nA bevy of dynamic color modes are preloaded, though some are more intuitive than others. Matter support makes it easy to incorporate these bulbs into any smart home ecosystem. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nFull support for automations is built into the app, and not just schedules (including effects that gradually dim or brighten). For example, you can set the light to change color if rain is in the forecast or be triggered based on your location via a geofencing feature. The AiDot app also has a final feature that tracks energy usage, including running time and power consumption in kWh by day and by week. Bar graphs let you monitor power use at a glance.\n\nWith all these features in the AiDot app, it might seem superfluous to connect the bulb to another ecosystem, but the bulb’s Matter support meant I had no trouble onboarding the bulb to iOS Home via Matter through a quick QR code scan with my phone, though as with many Matter devices, you’ll lose access to some of the features available in the AiDot app if you choose to bypass it.\n\nFurther reading: This review is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best smart lighting\n\nShould you buy Linkind Matter Smart RGBTW A19 Smart Bulbs?\n\nLinkind’s light quality looks fine, the bulb is quick to respond, it dims smoothly, and of course it costs very little per bulb. As brand names go, Linkind is as anonymous as the next—I’m not even sure how to pronounce it—but it’s hard to argue with the results."}

Rand Paul (R–Ky.) has been speaking out against President Donald Trump's tariffs. He supported a bill to repeal the emergency powers that allowed him to levy tariffs on Canada and recently co-sponsored a joint resolution with Sen. Ron Wyden (D–Ore.) to immediately terminate the national emergency that Trump declared in order to impose the worldwide tariffs. Paul joins the show today to explain his opposition to tariffs, defend free trade, warn about the dangers of expansive emergency powers, and discuss his own bill to end unilateral tariffs for good: the No Taxation Without Representation Act of 2025.\n\nThis interview was recorded on April 8, 2025.\n\nSources Referenced:\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00 Coming up…\n\n00:22 Introduction\n\n01:04 Can the president start a trade war alone?\n\n04:25 Congress vs. emergency powers on tariffs\n\n06:11 Paul reacts to Trump's market and trade comments\n\n09:09 Is the middle class really hollowed out?\n\n13:59 Tariffs, class warfare, and the MAGA Left\n\n16:33 Debunking the Rust Belt narrative and the future of jobs\n\n20:46 Paul on the Taxation Without Representation Act\n\nThis is an AI-generated transcript. Check against the original before quoting.\n\nZach Weissmueller: Can the president really just start a trade war by himself? Just asking questions. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is here today because he objects to the idea that the president can unilaterally levy taxes—which is what tariffs are—without any input from Congress. He's got a bill that makes that clear, and he joins us today to talk about it. Senator Paul, thank you for coming on.\n\nSen. Rand Paul: Glad to be with you.\n\nZach Weissmueller: There's been market turmoil since the tariffs were announced. We've seen two of the top 10 largest daily point losses in the Dow's history in just the past week. You and your fellow Kentuckian Mitch McConnell have been breaking with the GOP on this. Why do you think this policy hurts your constituents?\n\nSen. Rand Paul: Well, you know, it's interesting. I have yet to have anybody that's in business in Kentucky call me and say, \"Oh, pleased to have tariffs.\" I have the farmers who call me and they say, \"We export about 20 percent of what we sell, but we're still suffering from the tariffs in the previous Trump administration in 2018, 2019.\" The bourbon industry contacts me and says, \"Well, retaliatory tariffs by Europe, Canada, and other countries will hurt our exports of bourbon.\"\n\nI have shippers, international shippers, and domestic shippers who also do international. They say it'll hurt them. Homebuilders say, \"Well, if lumber and steel go up, the price of houses will go up.\" And already we have high interest rates, and we already have inflation in homes. So I really don't get anybody coming to me and saying, \"Please have tariffs.\" I'll say they're worried about the tariffs.\n\nBut I think more generally, the problem is there's an economic fallacy that's being promoted. The fallacy is that somebody's getting ripped off—that when you trade, somebody gets ripped off. And the problem with this is it's completely false. It's not even just a little false. It's completely and entirely false.\n\nThe U.S. doesn't trade with China. You trade with Walmart. You go to Walmart and you buy something. But in that trade, it has to be mutually beneficial. You have to perceive it as a benefit to you. You will give your 50 bucks for some kind of electronics there, or a hundred dollars for electronics, only if you value the electronics more than your 50 dollars, and vice versa. Trade is always mutually beneficial.\n\nSo how can we have millions of trades with Walmart or Target or all these companies, and they're all mutually beneficial, and then we say, \"Well, we add them all up and we've been ripped off. China is ripping us off.\" It's just not true.\n\nAnother way to look at this is for the last 70 years, trade has been growing exponentially—international trade—but you know what else has been growing exponentially? GDP. GDP per capita is growing exponentially over 70 years. Trade is actually proportional.\n\nWe have to actually have the fundamental debate: Is trade good or bad? And without question, the statistics overwhelmingly say trade is good. We're getting richer. One hundred thousand people escape poverty every day because of capitalism and its extension, trade.\n\nLiz Wolfe: You recently co-authored with Senator Tim Kaine a joint resolution that just passed the Senate and would, in fact, terminate the emergency powers that President Trump is using to impose tariffs on Canada. For this, he unfortunately blasted you and a handful of other Republicans as disloyal. Do you feel like Congress has real hope of checking his power right now?\n\nSen. Rand Paul: You know, I don't like the idea of living under emergency rule. Emergency rule basically would be overruling the Constitution and saying that the separation of powers no longer exists. When our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they were very, very wary of a king, and they didn't want to create an executive branch or a president that was anything like a king. So they gave our president very little power on important powers like taxation. Some people call taxation the power to destroy. Our Founding Fathers gave that power to Congress, and even more specifically, they said taxes have to originate in the House of Representatives before they come to the Senate.\n\nSo I think the president taking emergency powers to institute taxes is unconstitutional and shouldn't be allowed. I voted against the emergency powers and will continue to do so. In our history, we've had tariffs from almost the very beginning. We've had some form of tariffs, but the tariffs were passed by Congress. They weren't instituted by the president, and no self-respecting constitutionalist in the early parts of our country's history would have ever approved of letting the president do it without congressional authority.\n\nLiz Wolfe: We have a few highlights of President Trump talking to reporters about the market plunge from Air Force One on Sunday. I'd like to roll that clip and get your reaction real fast.\n\nPresident Trump: We have to solve our trade deficit with China. We have a trillion-dollar trade deficit with China, hundreds of billions of dollars a year we lose with China because of the tariffs. We have $7 trillion already committed to be invested in the United States, building auto plants, building chip companies, and all sorts of companies are coming into our country at levels that we've never seen before. What's going to happen with the market? I can't tell you, but I can tell you: Our country has gotten a lot stronger. I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\n\nLiz Wolfe: Is what's happening in the stock market right now simply a tough pill that we have to swallow, a medicine as President Trump claims?\n\nSen. Rand Paul: I think the goal of encouraging foreigners and others to invest in our country is good. And I think that the way you should encourage them is by having freedom—freedom of expression, freedom in your home to keep the government or invaders out of your home, freedom in your business to have low regulations and low taxes—and those should be encouragement enough to bring people to our country.\n\nBut the idea that somehow we've been ripped off by having a trade deficit with China is just not true. For example, the trade deficit with China goes down when we have a recession. When we have terrible economics, the deficit goes down. When we have boom or growth, our deficit goes up. Trade deficits go up during booms and down during depressions.\n\nWhat does that tell you? Trade deficits are not a good indicator. Trade is proportional to economic well-being. So it's just not true, but it's easy for people to believe. They're like, \"We want to blame somebody. We wish our life was better. We think something's wrong about our life and we think the Chinese did it,\" or it used to be the Japanese who they said did it.\n\nIn the 1980s, I remember distinctly, everybody said the Japanese are taking over this and that, and we have to do something about the Japanese owning things in our country. It turns out Japanese investment has been good in our county in Kentucky. Toyota employs 14,000 Kentuckians. They assemble the Camry there. They make between $70,000 and $120,000 a year working on the line. These are very good jobs. I'm very happy that Toyota is in our state.\n\nJim Beam is now owned by Suntory, which is a Japanese company. I'm happy they're in our state as well. We have German brake manufacturers. International trade is good. It is good for our country. We just need to get over that. But this is why the basics of trade have to be debated, and we have to understand that the U.S. doesn't trade with China. Individuals buy stuff from the internet or from a grocery store, but the individuals are all getting a good deal, not a bad deal, and I don't want to restrict their purchases or make their purchases more expensive with a tax.\n\nLiz Wolfe: Okay, so I feel you on this point that people are looking for a convenient scapegoat, but is there any truth to this idea that's currently raging in our political discourse that goes something like this? The middle class has been hurting for far too long, and that's because the Rust Belt and America's manufacturing capacity have really been hollowed out. Those jobs have been outsourced overseas, and now there's a real glut of people without dignified work in lots of regions of the country, and that this is a push to ensure that they are able to emerge into the workforce once again and be richer than ever before. Is there truth to this narrative that the middle class has been hollowed out?\n\nSen. Rand Paul: No, it's absolutely untrue. If you look at the statistics on household income over the last 70 years, if you call lower class $50,000 and under, middle class $50,000 to $100,000, and upper class above $100,000, what you find is that the lower class has shrunk. Under $50,000, there are fewer people; slightly. Between $50,000 and $100,000, the middle class, there's slightly fewer people also. What does that mean? They didn't become poor. Where did they go? The upper class, above $100,000, has tripled over the last 70 years.\n\nSo the middle class has not been hollowed out by becoming poor. The middle class is slightly smaller, but by becoming richer. What people don't understand is they see things in immediate sort of terms. During the Biden administration with inflation, significant inflation, the purchasing power of your check went down. And so you were transiently, in the last four years, the middle class was poor. Not because of trade, but because of inflation, because of debt, printing up new money to pay for the debt, the inflation, the loss of purchasing power, the diminishing value of the dollar, and the increase in general prices. That made people transiently poor. But on a 70-year curve, we've all gotten richer.\n\nHumanProgress.org talks a lot about this. Steven Pinker talked about this in Enlightenment Now. What you find is actually that 100,000 people are escaping poverty every day around the world. In 1820, 98 percent of people lived in abject poverty—less than $2 a day. When I was married in 1990, it was down to a third of the world living in abject poverty. Today, it's less than 10 percent.\n\nWhy are the poor coming up out of poverty? Trade. What is trade? It's an extension of capitalism. Essentially, trade is volunteerism, but it's also the extension of the division of labor. Adam Smith wrote about this, and he said that prosperity is only limited by the extent of the division of labor. So the division of labor occurred when somebody in every household made their own shoes, and then one person in the village made shoes for the whole community. Then it turned out some guy two counties over—or woman—was even better. And that person began making shoes for the whole region. Then the state, and then we traded across state lines and national lines.\n\nWith every extension of the division of labor, the specialization of labor changed. Some manufacturing was lost because of regulations, and some of it was lost because of governmental enhancements of unions. When governments began protecting unions in the 1930s—not just the right to bargain collectively, which is a basic economic and capitalist right, but when they protected unions from competition and gave them special privileges—they enhanced labor rates above the world labor rate, and that cost us some.\n\nWe also didn't innovate. When we started doing steel, the electric arc furnace was an innovation. We didn't innovate with that, and we still have the blast furnace. We haven't been as efficient or cost effective with making steel, and the rest of the world got past us.\n\nAs countries advance, as they get richer, many jobs in manufacturing actually do go to other parts of the world. As you become richer, you buy more stuff because you're rich. If you ask a rich person what their trade deficit is with Amazon, a rich person has a much bigger trade deficit with Amazon than a poor person. We're a rich country. We buy more stuff. We're always going to have a bigger trade deficit than everybody as long as we are rich.\n\nIf you want to get rid of the trade deficit, we could become poor. If we went into a massive recession and we quit buying stuff, we didn't have any money to buy anything, we'll get rid of the trade deficit—and we'll be poor.\n\nIt's so important that people realize that the trade deficit grows smaller when we spend less, when we have a recession. The trade deficit actually grows larger when we're buying more, when we're in an economic boom.\n\nZach Weissmueller: Yeah, I mean, you're talking about this as growing the pie for everyone. But what I'm hearing from the supporters of these tariffs within Trump's coalition is more of a zero-sum argument where, yeah, this might temporarily hurt Wall Street, but it's going to help es.ulpgc.dacd.businessunit.Main Street and bring back working-class jobs. And those things are in tension.\n\nThat's exactly what we heard from a guest we had last week, Batya Ungar-Sargon, who describes herself as a MAGA leftist. Have you been surprised to see this more of a class warfare type of lens spread throughout the Republican Party? And how do you respond to that way of looking at things?\n\nSen. Rand Paul: Well, populism and nationalism are not pro-capitalist, pro-free markets, or pro-freedom. It's really a disjointed philosophy that is built upon incorrect premises. So you're right. They see everything as zero sum: If someone wins, someone has to lose.\n\nActually, the marketplace is win-win. It's one of these curious things about trade. If I buy something from you, in my mind I have to think I want it. If I have $100 and I want to buy the microphone that's in front of you for $100, I give you $100 but I want the microphone more than my $100. I feel like I won. But interestingly, from your perception, you think you won because you wanted my $100 more than you wanted the microphone.\n\nWhen we make a trade—any trade, any purchase—both sides of the equation, it has to be what they call mutually beneficial. It's a win-win. The more trading, the more economic activity, it's winning all around.\n\nBut there's this misconception that's promoted that we've been losing for decades. We haven't been losing for decades; we've been winning for decades. The more international trade, the more trade—domestic trade, any kind of transaction in the marketplace—the more we are all winning. The statistics prove this out. But there have been too many people out there saying, \"Oh, the middle class is hollowed out, we're all poor.\"\n\nThe only way we've become poor in recent times is through inflation and loss of purchasing power when prices rise faster than your wages do. That is a real thing. But as far as trade goes, trade has actually been doing the opposite. Trade is proportional to wealth.\n\nLiz Wolfe: Zach and I were pushing back on this recently when sparring with some of our guests on whether or not free trade matters and is valuable for our country. One of the things we kept citing over and over again is: Look, if the Rust Belt were as hollowed out as people claim, why would we not see unemployment be way, way higher than it is?\n\nWe have certain sectors in this country where there actually are shortages, and these are working-class jobs that require not a four-year college degree or an advanced degree, but rather going to trade school. Like, we have a predicted shortage of plumbers coming our way in just a few years—by 2027, I believe.\n\nWhat do you make of this argument? I'm very sympathetic to the idea that it is important for the middle class to have dignified work here, but the idea that the Trump administration appears to have, where these factories will just spring up overnight and suddenly provide gainful employment and we'll hop into higher sort of Rust Belt factory towns the way we used to—it just strikes me as totally unmoored from reality, especially in an age of automation. What do you make of this claim?\n\nSen. Rand Paul: You know, it's based on falsehoods. There's a shortage of workers. When I go to a tech school in Louisville—I went to an HVAC class in a tech school recently, there were about 50 or 60 people in the class. Their tuition had all been paid. If they graduate, their tuition will be completely paid for by HVAC—air conditioner repair and salespeople. Everyone had a job. Everyone's tuition was paid. There's not enough people doing HVAC.\n\nAnd you say, \"Well, I don't want to do HVAC. I'll never make any money.\" If you own an HVAC company, you'll make more than every doctor in town. Air conditioners are a great business to be in. So I would tell someone who says, \"Well, this person's bright, they're intelligent, but they don't like reading books,\" go into HVAC. Go into electricity. Go into plumbing.\n\nElectrical contractors make more than every doctor in town. These are wonderful jobs you're going to have. And even if you're just an electrician, you might make $60,000 to $90,000 a year as an electrician. If you own it and you have four electricians working for you, you'll make a million dollars a year.\n\nSo there's a ton of jobs out there. It's the best time to ever be alive in our life. And we just have to get over the negativity of what we perceive. There's a fancy name for this: they call it the availability heuristic. The more things are available—we learn from things because they're bad—and we tend to sense and remember bad things. If the stock market's been going up for 50 years, we remember the three times it went down. By golly, we're going to be prepared for the downturn, when in reality, the compound interest of the market going up has been something we should have taken advantage of.\n\nSo it's incumbent upon us that we discuss this from first principles: Is trade good or bad? How does trade occur? And how can each individual trade be a good thing, but all trade gathered together be a negative thing? It's because you're grouping it through artificial sorts of lenses. You're circling around it with an artificial periphery.\n\nNobody cares about the trade deficit between South Carolina and North Carolina. Nobody cares about the trade deficit between me and the grocery store. It's an artificial designation. Everybody knows it's meaningless. So is the trade difference between us and China. It's completely meaningless. Because you know what would happen if it were destroying us? We wouldn't have any more money. How do we have more money to buy their stuff for generations?\n\nWe've had a trade deficit with China every quarter since 1976. If it's been bad, how come our economy keeps growing? How come the GDP keeps growing? How come our middle class is joining the upper class since that period of time? It's almost the exact same period our upper class has tripled—since we began running a trade deficit. If we weren't rich anymore, the trade deficit would go down. If we weren't rich anymore, we couldn't buy their stuff. So people have to get to first principles in this basic discussion: Is trade good or bad? I think, without question, trade is good.\n\nI think we're getting close to our end though. How close are we, guys?\n\nZach Weissmueller: Yeah, I've got one last question about your Taxation Without Representation Act, which I'm going to bring up here. Unlike other bills being proposed, it specifically reins in the ability of the president to levy tariffs without congressional approval. It reaches back into the history and applies to various tariff laws and trade agreements over the past century. Why do you think this is a misuse of emergency power in need of correction?\n\nSen. Rand Paul: Well, I think it's primarily a misuse of taxation power. Tariffs are a tax, and taxes have to be passed first in the House and then sent to the Senate. In addition to being an abuse of the taxation power, it's an abuse of emergency power.\n\nEmergencies, to me, are someone invading—you know, the Japanese have invaded, it's World War II, and they've come ashore in California. That's an emergency. Saying that we've had a trade deficit with Vietnam is not an emergency.\n\nSo I voted last week with those who believe we shouldn't have an emergency with Canada. Ostensibly, they say it's because of fentanyl. I've also seen statistics now that say that more fentanyl goes to Canada from the U.S. than comes from Canada into the U.S. So it's hardly a fentanyl emergency on our northern border.\n\nNow, it is the opposite in the south. We have a problem with fentanyl coming in from Mexico. But in Canada, they say more is going to Canada from the U.S. than coming in. Also, Canada agreed to do more policing of it. So there's no reason in the world we should put tariffs on them.\n\nBut we're also putting tariffs on about a hundred different countries. We're going to have an emergency with Vietnam? An emergency with Cambodia? An emergency with the Philippines? An emergency with Israel?\n\nIt's interesting—and you want to know how potent an issue this is? Netanyahu came here from Israel. And usually he wants more money or arms to be involved with the latest war. He came this time to say, \"Lay off us on the tariffs.\"\n\nSo the tariffs are the most pressing issue to Israel right now, and they're in the middle of a war in Gaza. But the most important issue to their well-being and their ability to survive over there is American tariffs. That should give you pause when you think about whether tariffs are a good or bad idea.\n\nLiz Wolfe: We understand you have to go and get back out there and vote, Senator Paul. Thank you so much for talking to Reason."}

Quansah’s campaign began with a rough outing against Ipswich Town, where he was substituted at half-time in Liverpool’s Premier League opener. From there, appearances became sporadic.\n\nIn Arne Slot’s new-look Liverpool, trust had to be rebuilt. Mistakes in the Carabao Cup against Brighton, including a misplaced pass that led to Simon Adingra’s goal and a deflected own goal, only added to the scepticism. Though the Reds won 3-2, it was another dent in the young defender’s confidence.\n\nSlot’s Trust Slowly Rebuilt\n\nWhat followed was a quiet resurgence. Slot, to his credit, didn’t write the youngster off. Tactical flexibility, including covering at right-back, and consistent effort in training slowly turned the tide. Liverpool have since made their stance clear – Quansah “has been labelled as not being for sale this summer despite interest.”\n\nInter Milan’s Defensive Puzzle\n\nThat hasn’t deterred Inter Milan. Spazio Inter reveal that Simone Inzaghi is “casting an eye on Quansah” as he seeks defensive reinforcements. Though Yann Bisseck currently fills a vital role in Inzaghi’s backline, his positional errors have raised doubts. The Italian club is reportedly seeking “an upgrade.”\n\nInter’s system – a back three requiring defenders to cover large spaces and distribute confidently – makes Quansah an ideal profile. Standing 190cm tall, he brings “quality on the ball and ability to cover spaces effectively,” according to Spazio Inter.\n\nDisputed Valuation Raises Eyebrows\n\nPerhaps the most surprising detail is valuation. Spazio Inter believe that Quansah is only worth €20m (£17m) – a figure that seems out of step with market reality, especially considering Liverpool sold Sepp van den Berg for a potential £25m to Brentford just last summer.\n\nWith interest in Quansah on the rise, Liverpool’s stance may be tested – though any negotiation would likely start well above the quoted valuation.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nExpectant Liverpool fans will watch this situation with a mix of intrigue and pride. On one hand, Quansah’s journey from raw talent to international interest is a testament to both his resilience and the club’s development structure. But on the other, there’s frustration that his progress could now be undervalued by clubs like Inter Milan.\n\n“€20m? It’s insulting,” one could imagine a Kopite fuming. “He’s done the hard yards, bounced back after mistakes, and now he’s showing signs of maturity – and they want him on the cheap?”\n\nArne Slot’s trust in Quansah – using him even in awkward positions like emergency right-back – speaks volumes. For Liverpool fans, this isn’t just a player coming good; it’s one of their own maturing on the big stage.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, letting Quansah leave – especially for under £30m – would be a significant risk. With Joel Matip leaving and Van Dijk ageing, keeping youthful defensive depth isn’t just a luxury – it’s a necessity.\n\nSo while Inter Milan’s interest flatters, Liverpool supporters will hope their club laughs off any such derisory offer. This is a defender with long-term Anfield potential. And that’s priceless."}

Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk – two players whose influence cannot be overstated – are reportedly on the verge of signing new contracts that will extend their stays into the twilight of their glittering careers.\n\nAccording to Fabrizio Romano, via GiveMeSport, Liverpool are working hard behind the scenes to get both deals over the line. “Liverpool maintain their confidence that both Salah and Van Dijk will stay and sign new deals. The club absolutely want to get it done ASAP, as Trent is getting closer and closer to Real Madrid,” Romano explained.\n\nWhile Trent Alexander-Arnold edges towards the Bernabéu, these renewals are being positioned not just as statements of intent but as necessary anchors for Arne Slot’s new era.\n\nTiming is everything for Liverpool\n\nThe urgency within Liverpool’s hierarchy is understandable. Securing the long-term futures of Salah and Van Dijk now – before Trent’s likely departure becomes official – would provide a much-needed lift for supporters and the squad alike. It is about setting a tone. About proving the club remains ambitious and stable, even amid inevitable change.\n\nFor much of the season, the contract stand-offs involving both players have cast long shadows over Liverpool’s progress. There’s been tension, speculation, and the creeping sense that a golden era was slowly fading. Now, the clarity fans have craved appears to be on the horizon.\n\nPlayers pushing for resolution\n\nIt isn’t just the club that wants this resolved. According to Romano, both Salah and Van Dijk are keen to move forward too. “Salah and Van Dijk themselves will be more relieved than anyone when their new deals with the Reds are finally announced in the coming weeks.”\n\nNeither has ever publicly agitated for a move – their silence has often spoken of loyalty – but uncertainty has clouded their influence this season. With these new deals, they can step into 2025 and beyond knowing they are part of Liverpool’s vision.\n\nFoundation for the next chapter\n\nIf and when these contracts are finalised, the focus can shift to what’s next: reshaping a team that can challenge on all fronts again. Losing Trent Alexander-Arnold will hurt. There’s no softening that blow. But securing Salah and Van Dijk ensures that two pillars remain – a spine still strong enough to hold up a title charge.\n\nThis summer, for Liverpool, isn’t just about who comes in. It’s about who stays. These deals, when announced, will be about identity as much as ambition.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool supporters, this is exactly the kind of news we’ve been waiting for. The past few months have felt like walking a tightrope – one foot in a title race, the other dangling over an uncertain future. But news that Salah and Van Dijk are both set to stay? That’s stabilising. That’s reassuring.\n\nLosing Trent will sting, no question. He’s a generational talent and a local lad who embodied what it meant to wear the red shirt. But this club has always been about collective strength. And in Salah and Van Dijk, we’re keeping two players who still set the standard in their positions – leaders, game-changers, icons.\n\nYou don’t rebuild by ripping everything out. You do it by keeping your strongest bricks in place. These contract extensions are that. They buy Slot time, they inspire the dressing room, and they tell future signings that this is still a club going places.\n\nFans know how important legacy is at Anfield. With Van Dijk marshalling the defence and Salah terrorising backlines for at least a few more years, Liverpool can still write new chapters in their modern history. And with a fresh project taking shape, they’ll be more vital than ever."}

As one of the most influential players in the Premier League, his renewal could not only signal continuity but also set the tone for the club’s ambitions under manager Arne Slot. Salah, along with Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold, represents the spine of Liverpool’s success in recent years, making their contract situations of paramount importance to fans and pundits alike.\n\nSalah’s Growing Influence at Liverpool\n\nWith 32 goals and 22 assists across all competitions this season, Mohamed Salah’s contribution to Liverpool’s attacking potency cannot be overstated. His role in Arne Slot’s system has been pivotal, with the Egyptian forward showing little sign of slowing down at the age of 32. According to The Times, Salah has long expressed his desire to remain at Anfield, despite the prolonged nature of contract negotiations. “Mohamed Salah is closing in on an agreement with Liverpool to extend his contract and remain at Anfield,” the report confirmed. This is a huge boost for both the player and the club, as Liverpool look to build upon their current success.\n\nSalah’s connection to the club is now deeply embedded in Liverpool’s culture. His remarkable tally of 54 goal involvements this season has firmly cemented his legacy as one of the club’s all-time greats. Although there have been moments of frustration on his part regarding the renewal process, sources close to the player have indicated that an agreement is now imminent. With Salah and Liverpool working towards a new deal, both sides appear poised to continue their successful partnership.\n\nVan Dijk’s Renewal and the Importance of Stability\n\nLiverpool’s captain, Virgil van Dijk, has also been a focal point in these contract discussions. The 33-year-old Dutch defender, who has been a cornerstone of Liverpool’s defence, has reportedly made progress in his own contract renewal negotiations. As The Times noted, after Liverpool’s dramatic 3-2 loss to Fulham, Van Dijk spoke about “progress” being made in his discussions. This reinforces the growing sense of optimism at the club that two of their most important players, Salah and Van Dijk, will remain beyond the summer.\n\nThe future of Trent Alexander-Arnold, however, remains more uncertain. With Real Madrid reportedly keen on signing the England right-back, Liverpool will be hoping to secure his services for the long term as well. However, if Madrid does make a move, it’s believed that the Spanish giants must inform Liverpool before finalising any agreement. With the contracts of key players like Salah and Van Dijk set to be sorted soon, the focus will then shift to Alexander-Arnold’s potential departure, which could have major implications for Liverpool’s defensive setup.\n\nSalah’s Role in Slot’s Liverpool Revolution\n\nUnder Arne Slot, Liverpool have enjoyed a resurgence this season, currently sitting at the top of the Premier League with an 11-point lead. As The Times suggests, Salah remains integral to the club’s plans for the future. Slot, having publicly stated that he wants Salah to stay, is eager to build his team around the forward’s unmatched ability to score and create. Salah’s commitment to Liverpool would give the club the stability it needs to continue challenging for major honours in the coming years.\n\nLiverpool’s progress in the league, combined with the growing expectation that both Salah and Van Dijk will stay, could form the foundation of a new era at Anfield. With both players at the peak of their powers, their ongoing presence would enable Liverpool to remain competitive on all fronts.\n\nImpact of Salah’s Decision on Liverpool’s Future\n\nMohamed Salah’s contract renewal represents more than just the continuation of his playing career at Liverpool; it is a reflection of the club’s ambitions moving forward. As one of the best players in the world, Salah’s presence guarantees that Liverpool will remain a major force in the Premier League and Europe. His commitment to the club aligns with the broader vision under Arne Slot, ensuring that Liverpool can build on their current successes and continue to challenge for trophies.\n\nWith Salah’s renewal appearing imminent, fans can now look forward to another chapter in his illustrious career at Anfield. As Liverpool plan for the future, securing Salah’s services for the long term will be a statement of intent as the club looks to build a dynasty under Slot’s management.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs Liverpool supporters, the news of Mohamed Salah’s impending contract renewal comes as a relief. After all, he has been a central figure in Liverpool’s recent successes and, at 32, continues to defy age with his blistering pace and clinical finishing. The thought of him departing for Saudi Arabia or elsewhere has been unsettling, especially given his importance to the team this season.\n\nAs fans, we understand the significance of securing his services for the foreseeable future. With Arne Slot now at the helm, there’s an unmistakable sense of optimism around the club. The stability brought by extending Salah’s contract will not only be a huge boost for Slot’s ambitions but will also signal to the rest of the footballing world that Liverpool are serious about their future. The renewed focus on building a team around Salah, with Van Dijk and others, will undoubtedly shape the next phase of Liverpool’s post-Klopp era.\n\nLiverpool’s pursuit of domestic and European glory hinges on players like Salah, who remains one of the world’s best. His ongoing commitment to the club ensures that Liverpool can continue to challenge for the game’s top prizes in the years to come. The future looks bright, and Salah will undoubtedly play a crucial role in it."}

A rising star, a hefty contract demand, and the looming threat of Europe’s biggest clubs circling. This time, it’s Ibrahima Konaté at the centre of the storm. According to The Times journalist Hamzah Khalique-Loonat, the French defender’s agent has stunned FSG by requesting a mammoth 150% pay hike, pushing Konaté’s weekly wage demands to £200,000.\n\nThat’s a jump from his current £80,000—a staggering leap, and one that would vault the 25-year-old to the third-highest earner at the club, behind only Mohamed Salah (£350,000) and Virgil van Dijk (£220,000). The message is clear: Konaté and his camp believe his role in Liverpool’s spine deserves financial parity with the club’s elite.\n\nFrom Leipzig to Anfield: A Crucial Defender’s Rise\n\nSigned in May 2021 after Liverpool triggered his £36 million release clause from RB Leipzig, Konaté has been a revelation. Now in his fourth season at Anfield, the French international has amassed 126 appearances and emerged as the undisputed defensive partner to Van Dijk. That partnership has helped stabilise the back line in both domestic and European competition.\n\nYet his contract, signed as a five-year deal, is ticking down fast—set to expire in summer 2026. With just over 12 months before the Reds would be forced into a pivotal decision, no extension is in place. And Liverpool, having already navigated complex renewals for Salah, Van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold this year, are wary of another prolonged saga.\n\n“We understand the Reds have made it clear to Konaté that they are very much keen to tie him down for the long-term and reward him with a pay-hike on his current £80,000 a week arrangement.”\n\nDespite that willingness, the parties remain some distance apart.\n\nEurope’s Elite Circling as PSG and Madrid Monitor\n\nIt’s little surprise that Real Madrid and PSG are sniffing around. For both clubs, Konaté represents a ready-made defensive asset entering his peak. And for PSG, the homegrown angle adds another layer of appeal. Speaking to Canal Plus last year, Konaté didn’t hide his admiration:\n\n“If I said no, I’d be lying, but if you’re asking, is it one of my objectives? Not at all.”\n\nStill, in a February interview, he struck a professional tone:\n\n“To hear big clubs like that are showing interest in me is very flattering! Now I’m focusing on this season, giving it my all, and I’ll let my agents take care of the rest.”\n\nWith such admiration being publicly expressed, and contract talks at an impasse, Liverpool may be forced to consider offers. “Konaté could be put up for sale by Liverpool with two giants keen,” reads the key line from The Times.\n\nFSG’s Dilemma: Cash In or Back the Defender?\n\nFSG now find themselves in a familiar bind. Reward a player who’s become essential—but whose availability has been inconsistent—or risk letting yet another key talent leave amid financial constraints and squad renewal plans under new boss Arne Slot.\n\nShould no compromise be found, The Times suggests, “FSG could be left with little choice but to put the defender up for sale and listen to offers for his services this summer.”\n\nAnd if that happens, the expected price tag exceeds £50 million—a reflection of both his quality and market value.\n\nInterestingly, Ben Jacobs noted last month that the Reds first attempted to extend Konaté’s contract in 2023, but that proposal has become a “staring point for talks.”\n\nWhile Liverpool may not want to sell, the current impasse and interest from clubs with deeper pockets could make this summer decisive. And in a squad evolving post-Klopp, such turning points are no longer rare—they’re becoming a feature of the new regime.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThere’s admiration for Ibrahima Konaté’s performances, no doubt. He’s been immense on his day—powerful in the air, commanding in duels, and progressive with the ball. But here’s the rub: fans aren’t just worried about the wage hike; we’re worried about the precedent. If £80,000 jumps to £200,000 without a significant trophy haul or consistent fitness, what does that say to the rest of the dressing room?\n\nThere’s also a growing anxiety about how FSG approach these key renewals. First Henderson, then the flirtations with losing Salah, Van Dijk and Trent… now Konaté. Continuity is meant to be a cornerstone of Liverpool’s identity. But instead of building on a core, we’re starting to resemble a club constantly playing financial catch-up with its own stars.\n\nIf Konaté walks and we’re left scrambling for a replacement—possibly cheaper, younger and less experienced—it feels like a step back at a time when Arne Slot needs assured performers. This summer could define how we re-establish dominance—or how we lose more ground. Let’s hope compromise wins."}

The 20th league title—the long-awaited one that would finally equal Manchester United’s record—is well within reach. For most clubs, this would be a moment of celebration. For Liverpool, however, there’s an unexpected tension in the air.\n\nThe Reds have stumbled out of three cup competitions in quick succession. A painful EFL Cup final defeat to Newcastle United followed exits from both the FA Cup and the Champions League. And while those losses came against quality opposition, the reaction among parts of the fanbase has been surprisingly swift and harsh. Fingers have been pointed—at Arne Slot for rotation and tactical tweaks, at the ownership group FSG for perceived passivity in the transfer market, and at players for running out of steam at a critical point.\n\nThe latest blow, a 3-2 defeat away to Fulham, was a performance that highlighted the physical and mental fatigue coursing through the squad. Though the loss was only Liverpool’s second in the league, it reignited debate around squad depth and consistency. But context is important. Despite that result, Liverpool remains firmly in control of the title race. Arsenal, 11 points adrift, are unlikely to make up ground—especially as they rotate this weekend ahead of a Champions League quarter-final second leg against Real Madrid, having already won the first leg 3-0.\n\nFatigue, Frustration and a Chance to Reset\n\nBack in Merseyside, there’s no room for complacency. West Ham visit Anfield this weekend, and while the fixture offers a chance to bounce back, it also presents another test of mentality. Arne Slot will need to carefully manage tired legs, knowing the finishing line is near—but not yet crossed.\n\nThe reality is that this team is overachieving in a season of transition. Arne Slot arrived with the challenge of succeeding Jurgen Klopp—no small feat. Integrating a new footballing philosophy while battling on four fronts was always going to produce friction. What has been achieved—particularly in the league—deserves recognition, even amid the recent disappointment.\n\n1 defeat in 27 games\n\nMost points in the last 10 league games\n\nBeen top four all season\n\nBeen top of the league for 20+ matches\n\nArsenal not once been within one game touching distance of us One defeat and Sky paint a picture of chaos and crisis https://t.co/NqvPLhMvBk — LFC Stats (@LFCData) April 8, 2025\n\nCup Losses Could Spark Transfer Market Urgency\n\nThe struggles of the past few weeks may prove beneficial in the long term, as there was a danger that a dominant league campaign might encourage the club’s hierarchy to stand still. The cracks that have been exposed during this intense run-in will serve as a timely reminder: this squad still needs regeneration. Sporting CEO Michael Edwards, Director of Football Richard Hughes, and Arne Slot are all well aware of that. Plans are already in motion for a summer of transformation.\n\nLiverpool will need five or six high-level signings—players who can inject depth, athleticism, and reliability into a squad that has leaned heavily on a core group. Injuries, form dips, and fatigue have exposed the limits of the current setup. A league title should not cloud the need for renewal—it should sharpen it.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lfcdata/status/1909718068001140921?s=46&t=rxgukmqdoXc4muVFLSx2EQ\n\nA Title as a Launchpad, Not a Conclusion\n\nIn truth, a few bumps on the way to glory may be the best outcome. They keep the standards high and prevent dangerous complacency. And should Liverpool lift their 20th title in May, it will serve as a platform—not a conclusion.\n\nThe next phase under Arne Slot must be about building a squad that doesn’t just win the league—but is built to win everything. Again and again."}

While the former Liverpool and England captain has recently distanced himself from a swift return to coaching, the interest from the south coast appears genuine.\n\nGerrard’s last managerial post was with Al Ettifaq in the Saudi Pro League, a spell that ended in January 2025 after a challenging 18-month tenure. At the time of his departure, Al Ettifaq were 12th in an 18-team league, just five points clear of relegation. The conclusion of his time in Saudi Arabia was a mutual decision, reflecting the inconsistent results and perhaps a shared sense of exhaustion.\n\nTaking a Breather – But for How Long?\n\nGerrard himself admitted a desire to step away from football’s daily grind. “I will go in at some point but when it’s round the clocks, I’ve been doing it 18, 19 months, I want to be free, I want to play a round of golf, go down the boozer and have a couple of beers, do normal things that you can’t do when you’re coaching,” he told reporters.\n\n“I’m happy with waking up and being free, doing the family stuff, just being free away from stress.”\n\nHowever, as the Southampton vacancy opens up, Gerrard may be tempted to reconsider his short-term sabbatical. His reputation, particularly from his time at Rangers where he led the Scottish giants to an unbeaten title-winning season, still holds currency. Whether it’s enough to sway Southampton’s hierarchy remains to be seen.\n\nSouthampton’s Search and the Lallana Factor\n\nGerrard isn’t the only name in contention. Steve Cooper, recently dismissed by Leicester City, is viewed by many as the leading candidate. Sean Dyche also features prominently, bringing with him the experience and defensive solidity he demonstrated at Burnley and Everton.\n\nStill, Gerrard’s candidacy is an intriguing one — and there’s already a link to Anfield within the current Saints setup. Adam Lallana, the former Liverpool midfielder, has been appointed assistant to interim boss Simon Rusk. Lallana, who made over 230 appearances for Southampton before moving to Merseyside and later Brighton, represents a natural connection between Gerrard and the south coast club.\n\nHis presence could be instrumental should Southampton pursue Gerrard further. Familiarity, respect and a shared understanding of club culture could aid a transition should the job be offered.\n\nWhat Gerrard Brings to the Table\n\nAt 44, Gerrard is still early in his managerial career. After success at Rangers and mixed fortunes at Aston Villa and Al Ettifaq, he remains a coach of potential more than proof. But his charisma, tactical ambition, and winning mentality still resonate.\n\nIf Southampton are looking to blend Championship pragmatism with long-term identity, Gerrard — despite his hiatus — could offer an ideal middle ground. He knows the pressure of expectation, but also the patience required to build something sustainable.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nSeeing Gerrard linked with a return to English football always brings a mixture of pride and hesitation. Pride, because he remains one of the club’s greatest figures — someone who carries Liverpool’s values with him wherever he goes. Hesitation, because the managerial journey hasn’t been a smooth one since his success at Rangers.\n\nThe Al Ettifaq spell was a risk, and perhaps not the wisest move in hindsight. But Gerrard’s self-awareness in stepping away, reflecting, and admitting he needs time out is a strength, not a weakness. It shows maturity and a willingness to learn.\n\nSouthampton could be a clever fit. A Championship side with ambition, history, and a good mix of youth and experience — exactly the kind of environment where a coach can implement long-term ideas. The presence of Adam Lallana only strengthens the case.\n\nIf Gerrard does take the role, it won’t just be about rebuilding Southampton — it’ll be about rebuilding himself too. Liverpool fans will watch closely, hopeful that their former captain finds his rhythm again, not for sentimental reasons, but because his journey as a manager still deserves to be written."}

The 19-year-old winger has emerged as a shining light in a turbulent season for Olympique Lyon, scoring ten goals and providing five assists, including six strikes in the Europa League. In a campaign where headlines around the club have been dominated by financial instability and internal upheaval, Fofana has done his talking on the pitch.\n\nAnd now, the chatter around his future has intensified. With both Liverpool and Arsenal reported to be tracking the Belgian-born forward, his name has appeared regularly in transfer discussions. Yet, the teenager remains admirably grounded.\n\n“Honestly, I hear about it (Liverpool and Arsenal) but it doesn’t affect me, so I just focus on myself, and I know when I do great that the rest will come,” Fofana told Football Insider.\n\nLyon’s Financial Trouble Could Force Sale\n\nFofana’s progress has come at a time of great uncertainty for Lyon. Owner John Textor’s mismanagement has left the club in a precarious financial position, with fears of relegation to Ligue 2 should key obligations go unmet. Selling players like Fofana may not be a choice, but a necessity.\n\nDespite being under contract until 2028, Fofana’s estimated value ranges from €30 million to €50 million, shaped by a €39.3 million valuation from the CIES Football Observatory. In the current market, such a price tag is not outlandish for a player with Fofana’s output and upside.\n\nHis former agent, Bobo Fofana, had previously stirred speculation by claiming that Liverpool would be the “choice of his client’s heart.”\n\nPremier League Dream Brewing\n\nFofana himself admits admiration for English football. “I watch a lot of the Premier League, I know there is a lot of big clubs, so for the moment, I just want to make that return on the pitch,” he said.\n\nBut he knows where his focus lies. “In my head I said to myself – ‘this season I have to show myself to the world’. I know I am capable of that,” he continued. “I know my talents, I know what I can do, so it was just a matter of time. I know people will always talk – I stay calm, I have a great mentality so I know it will come.”\n\nAt 19, that kind of maturity is notable. It reflects the kind of character Liverpool’s recruitment team have long sought to integrate — young players not just with ability, but with temperament.\n\nLiverpool’s Strategic Fit for Fofana\n\nShould a deal materialise, Liverpool offers a compelling environment. Arne Slot’s arrival marks a continuation of a development-first philosophy, and Fofana fits the template of a versatile forward capable of growing within an elite system. His preferred role is on the left, but he can operate across the front three — a trait that aligns with the club’s fluid attacking style.\n\nThat said, Fofana would represent both a gamble and a long-term investment. The physicality and tempo of the Premier League are considerable adjustments. But under Slot, with the infrastructure in place at Kirkby, Liverpool are well-equipped to support such a transition.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool, Malick Fofana feels like a classic early-stage move. Young, confident, and unshackled by ego — there’s something familiar about his profile. Think back to Sadio Mané’s first few years, or even Luis Díaz’s arrival — not world beaters immediately, but players who grew into giants through the system.\n\nWhat stands out is his mentality. That quote — “I stay calm, I have a great mentality so I know it will come” — is everything you want to hear from a teenager linked with Anfield. No drama, no hype-chasing. Just quiet confidence.\n\nWith Luis Díaz’s future unclear and questions around the front line under Slot, adding a player like Fofana makes sense. He won’t be expected to carry the team right away, but he’ll have the space and support to adapt. And if Lyon need to sell, this could be a smart window to strike.\n\nWe’ve seen Liverpool nurture raw talent into top-level contributors before. Fofana, with the right guidance, could be the next on that list."}

The Insurrection Act grants U.S. presidents the power to deploy the military into states for civilian law enforcement.\n\nTo share the rumor, users copied and pasted the text from the first (archived) in a series of articles written by a Medium.com blogger only identified by the handle of Aletheisthenes.\n\nThe rumor partly pertained to a Trump executive order issued on Jan. 20 declaring a national emergency at the southern U.S. border. Part of that order requested Trump to receive a joint report from the secretaries of defense and homeland security \"within 90 days\" — or by April 20 — advising \" whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.\" The order did not explicitly mention the words \"martial law.\"\n\nWhile Aletheisthenes, the author of the series of articles, featured at length a wealth of data about Trump's past actions, as well as information about the Insurrection Act of 1807 and martial law, this rumor existed more as a prediction than a provable claim.\n\nThe Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not yet respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\nA rumor that circulated online in April 2025 claimed U.S. President Donald Trump planned to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 on or just after April 20, an action that would purportedly lead to a declaration of rule enforced by military authorities — better known as martial law.\n\nOne reader emailed Snopes, \"I am seeing many posts on Facebook that on April 20, Trump will declare martial law.\" Another person referenced an executive order issued on Jan. 20, the first day of Trump's second term, and asked, \"I have seen a variety of posts suggesting that an early executive order signed by the president has set the stage for the imposition of martial law, and that this will be triggered by a report on the state of the border that will be released on April 20. Any truth here?\"\n\nThat Jan. 20 executive order declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border. One part of the order said that the secretaries of defense and homeland security would issue a joint report \"within 90 days,\" meaning by April 20. It further stated that the report would include guidance about \"whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.\" The order did not explicitly mention the words \"martial law.\"\n\nAs of this writing on April 9, this rumor existed more as a prediction than a provable claim. Searches of the websites for the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and the White House yielded no announcements, statements or demonstrable evidence that might help to shed light on the unproven matter.\n\nThose entities did not yet respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\nBreaking down the martial law rumor\n\nUsers on Bluesky (archived), Facebook (archived), Reddit (archived) and other social platforms shared the rumor as a lengthy block of copied-and-pasted text. That text originated from a March 21 article (archived) reported on the publishing platform Medium.com. The author did not self-identify in any other way other than by the handle Aletheisthenes.\n\n(Angela Woodward/Facebook)\n\nAletheisthenes' article — the first in a series (archived) of stories titled, \"The Coup Playbook: How They Quietly Kill the Constitution and Democracy in the Coming Weeks and Months\" — began with, \"On April 20, 2025, the United States may initiate its final steps into authoritarian rule.\"\n\nIn the article, Aletheisthenes predicted several supposed chronological steps following the invocation of the act and martial law, including \"expanded martial law\" following violent false flag operations at otherwise peaceful protests, arrests of journalists and politicians, military takeovers of major U.S. cities, press censorship, closed borders and postponed elections. The author ended the article, \"If we don't act before April 20, then by April 23, it will already be too late.\"\n\nSubsequent articles in the series featured Aletheisthenes discussing many other matters related to the predictions, including for example advising (archived) readers to prepare for the worst by buying survival supplies, water and food, and to \"beat the rush,\" \"go fast\" and \"go now.\" In another article, the author asked (archived) readers to use artificial-intelligence (AI) platforms to \"check my math.\"\n\nInterviewing Aletheisthenes\n\nBy email, the author who made the predictions answered several questions regarding the primary claim examined for this story — one positing Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act and then declare martial law. The author also was presented with a legal article that seemed to contradict the blog posts.\n\nThat article (archived) by Joseph Nunn, counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, states the Insurrection Act does not authorize martial law.\n\n\"The term 'martial law' has no established definition, but it is generally understood as a power that allows the military to take over the role of civilian government in an emergency,\" Nunn wrote on the matter in 2022. \"By contrast, the Insurrection Act generally permits the military to assist civilian authorities (whether state or federal), not take their place. Under current law, the president has no authority to declare martial law.\"\n\nWhen presented with Nunn's article, Aletheisthenes said, in part, that \"Trump has a history of testing what he can and can't do.\" The blogger also added, \"Trump is on record on wanting to declare martial law several times during his [first] administration,\" and that his \"guardrails\" from his first administration \"are gone.\"\n\nA search for information about Trump previously considering declaring martial law located a Dec. 19, 2020, article from The New York Times. The reporting said Trump discussed the idea of declaring martial law to \"rerun\" the election he had just lost, during an Oval Office meeting occurring on Dec. 18. Trump tweeted (archived) in response, \"Martial law = Fake News. Just more knowingly bad reporting!\" Trump also previously threatened in June 2020 to send federal forces to quell protests and violence following the death of George Floyd, a matter involving invoking the Insurrection Act.\n\nAletheisthenes also answered a question about changing the word \"will\" to \"may\" in the headline of the first article. The headline originally read, \"On April 20th, 2025, the United States will Cross the Point of No Return.\" The blogger answered, in part, \"I decided to tone it down,\" citing a person who called the blogger \"a malicious propagandist giving paranoid nutjobs nightmare fuel.\"\n\nWhen asked about whether Aletheisthenes purchased survival supplies — the advice the blogger gave to readers in Part Four (archived) of the series of articles — Aletheisthenes answered, \"Yes. I've never been a prepper before. But I did something different: I'm in a better financial position than many, and I actually ordered 6 months of survival rations and a pretty serious water filter. I figure we'll be feeding the neighbors.\n\n\"My intentions are good, at least in my own mind. Actually, I don't think I've ever done anything more important in my life, trying to get the word out and save our Constitution ... although it may already be too late. But at least if things go bad I know I tried. And maybe in some way I've gotten more people talking about it. And maybe by talking about it... it'll stop it from happening. And I just look like a crazy man. Which ... I can live with.\"\n\nA representative for Nunn, counsel with the Brennan Center for Justice, did not yet reply to an emailed request for further comment.\n\nInsurrection Act of 1807\n\nThe Library of Congress hosts the original text of the Insurrection Act of 1807 on Page 443 (archived) of legislation pertaining to the Ninth Congress. As of 2025, the act exists in its amended form in Title 10 of the U.S. Code. (The Trump-issued executive order from Jan. 20 specifically featured the words \"Insurrection Act of 1807,\" rather than generally referencing the matter as the \"Insurrection Act.\")\n\nThe original text from 1807 read as follows:\n\nChap. XXXIX. — An Act authorizing the employment of the land and naval forces of the United States, in cases of insurrections. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in all cases of insurrection, or obstruction to the laws, either of the United States, or of any individual state or territory, where it is lawful for the President of the United States to call forth the militia for the purpose of suppressing such insurrection, or of causing the laws to be duly executed, it shall be lawful for him to employ, for the same purposes, such part of the land or naval force of the United States, as shall be judged necessary, having first observed all the prerequisites of the law in that respect. Approved, March 3, 1807\n\nPresident Thomas Jefferson, in office from 1801 through 1809, introduced the act in response to fears that his former vice president, Aaron Burr, might incite a rebellion or insurrection after Jefferson replaced him for Jefferson's second term in the White House.\n\nNunn reported for the Brennan Center that \"the Insurrection Act was last invoked in 1992, when the governor of California requested military aid from President George H.W. Bush in response to civil unrest in Los Angeles that followed the acquittal of four white police officers charged with beating Black motorist Rodney King.\" The Brennan Center published a list of the many other times U.S. presidents invoked the Insurrection Act."}

[1] Ł. Kuśmierz\n\net al. [1] Ł. Kuśmierz ×\n\nHierarchical structures are found in a variety of complex systems whose individual units are interconnected at different levels. The collective behaviors emerging from these layered systems are often difficult to disentangle and interpret. Focusing on the quintessential complex system—the brain—Łukasz Kuśmierz and collaborators from the Allen Institute in Seattle have now developed a model to explain the role of hierarchy in controlling the chaotic activity of neurons [1].\n\nA simple hierarchical structure can be realized with a network in which nodes (neurons) with similar connectivity patterns are defined as belonging to the same “cluster.” At any time t + 1, the activity of each neuron is determined by the previous activities at time t of the neurons to which it is connected, according to some fixed rule. At the microscopic level, the dynamics are dominated by chaotic activity of the entire neuron population. At the macroscopic level, the dynamics are dominated by the behavior of clusters, each represented as the average of its constituent neurons. The researchers showed that competition between the microscopic and macroscopic dynamics leads to attenuation of chaos. This provides a robust mechanism to control and balance the network’s chaotic activity.\n\nIt has been postulated that the brain operates in a dynamical regime called the edge of chaos, where neuronal activity patterns are neither entirely ordered nor entirely random. It is thought that such a regime optimizes learning and information processing. According to Kuśmierz and co-workers, the competition that arises from introducing a hierarchical structure in a random network is sufficient to maintain the system near the edge of chaos, suggesting that this phenomenon could play an important role in biological neuronal systems.\n\n–Agnese Curatolo\n\nAgnese Curatolo is an Associate Editor at Physical Review Letters."}

Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nShoppers in the market for a portable monitor have no shortage of monitors to choose from, but many come from less well-known brands. Dell’s Pro 14 Plus is a well-respected option that provides a professional look and great USB-C connectivity. However, the monitor’s high pricing, limited features, and so-so image quality take it out of contention for most people.\n\nRead on to learn more, then see our roundup of the best portable monitors for comparison.\n\nDell Pro 14 Plus (P1425) specs and features\n\nA glance at the Dell Pro 14 Plus Portable Monitor’s specification sheet doesn’t reveal any surprises. The monitor’s 14-inch LCD panel has 1920×1200 resolution and a 60Hz refresh rate. It also provides two USB-C ports with DisplayPort, which provide the monitor’s connectivity.\n\nDisplay size: 14-inch 16:10 aspect ratio\n\nNative resolution: 1920×1200\n\nPanel type: 8-bit IPS LCD\n\nRefresh rate: 60Hz\n\nAdaptive sync: None\n\nHDR: None\n\nPorts: 2x USB-C ports with DisplayPort 1.2 and USB Power Delivery with power pass-through\n\nAudio: None\n\nWarranty: 3-year Advanced Exchange Service\n\nPrice: $369.99 MSRP\n\nGiven the specifications, you might be surprised to see the monitor carries an MSRP nearly $370. I suspect that will be discounted, as Dell often debuts products at a high MSRP, then adds a steep discount later. Still, the price sets expectations that the monitor struggles to meet.\n\nDell Pro 14 Plus design\n\nThe Dell Pro 14 Plus design immediately stands out from the portable monitors you see when you search for them on Amazon. Instead of using a case to prop up the monitor, it includes a kickstand that is permanently attached to the back when you sit it flat on your desk.\n\nThis style of kickstand keeps the display very stable on a desk. It’s almost impossible to knock over without flinging the entire monitor on the floor. Also, despite how it may look, the kickstand works well in both portrait and landscape orientation, and the monitor includes an auto-rotate function.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nHowever, the lack of a cover with built-in kickstand means you’ll have to keep track of the case separately when traveling. Dell provides a case with the portable monitor, at least, and it’s rather good. It even has a Velcro pocket for storing wires or small peripherals, which is rare.\n\nSpeaking of quality, the monitor’s look and feel is just passable. It’s nice at a glance thanks to its metallic luster, but touching it reveals that plastic is the material of choice. An aluminum panel across the rear of the monitor would help it feel more luxurious.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nDell Pro 14 Plus connectivity and features\n\nUSB-C is the port of choice for the Dell Pro 14 Plus portable monitor. It has two USB-C ports with one on each side of the kickstand. This arrangement is good because it means a USB-C port will always be nearby no matter if the portable monitor sits to the right or to the left of your laptop or desktop.\n\nThe USB-C ports also support DisplayPort, of course, for video input and they can handle up to 65W of USB power delivery. The monitor itself doesn’t require anywhere near that much power, but it can pass power through to other devices connected to the monitor.\n\nSo, for example, you can plug a USB-C power brick into the Dell Pro 14 Plus and then plug your laptop into the portable monitor. Most portable monitors don’t offer this feature, which means they will need power from a connected device or, in some cases, a separate power source from the USB-C input used to deliver video input to the portable monitor.\n\nFour buttons on the kickstand provide the monitor’s only built-in controls. One is the power button, another locks and unlocks the auto-rotation feature, and the other two control brightness.\n\nThe monitor otherwise lacks built-in controls for contrast, which is unusual. That’s only accessible through Dell’s Display and Peripheral Manager (DPPM) software. It’s a decent utility but weighs in at over 700MB and is only compatible with Windows PCs. The utility also lacks more advanced features, like color gamut or temperature customization. Given the portable monitor’s price, and the “Pro” badging, that’s a significant oversight.\n\nThe Dell Pro 14 Plus can pass power through to other devices connected to the monitor.\n\nDell Pro 14 Plus SDR image quality\n\nImage quality is often secondary for a portable monitor, but recent OLED monitors like the Viewsonic VP16-OLED have proven that portability and image quality don’t need to be mutually exclusive. The Dell Pro 14 Plus seems to have missed that memo, though it does offer one perk.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nBrightness. The perk is brightness.\n\nPortable monitors tend to be dim. A brighter display usually translates to increased power draw, which portable monitors try to avoid. The Dell Pro 14 Plus is an exception and delivers an excellent maximum brightness of 481 nits which, as the graph shows, is much higher than average.\n\nThat’s important. Portable monitors are often used on-the-go and in conference rooms or coffee shops where controlling ambient light isn’t an option. The Dell Pro 14 Plus will remain viewable in conditions that make other portable monitors look uncomfortably dim.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nThe Dell Pro 14 Plus does well in contrast, too, though it depends on how the monitor is compared.\n\nIt provides a solid, though not above-average, performance when compared to other IPS-LCD portable monitors like the Lenovo M14t and Viewsonic TD1656-2K. However, it’s obviously much less capable than OLED alternatives, like the Viewsonic VP16-OLED and Innocn 15A1F.\n\nIn the real world, the Dell Pro 14 Plus offers a decent sense of depth. It lacks the dimensionality an OLED display can provide, but it’s noticeably better than an ultra-budget portable monitor, and even many IPS-LCD desktop monitors.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nThe Dell Pro 14 Plus delivered only 99 percent of the sRGB color gamut, 74 percent of DCI-P3, and 74 percent of AdobeRGB. As the graph shows, that is at the low end of what I’ve seen from similar monitors. OLED alternatives are in a completely different league, as they can offer well over 90 percent coverage of all tested color gamuts.\n\nIn practice, that means the Dell Pro 14 Plus lacks the vibrant color some portable monitors can provide. It also means the monitor is a poor choice for content creation, as many colors simply won’t be visible on this monitor.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nColor accuracy proves stronger than color gamut on the Dell Pro 14 Plus, though still mid-pack. The monitor’s color error is low enough that it won’t be an issue for most people, but critical viewers might notice a few flaws. The test results showed the highest error in cyan and grayscale hues; personally, I felt greens were shifted a bit towards blue.\n\nThe Dell Pro 14 Plus provides a color temperature result of 6500K, which is exactly what I prefer. That means the image doesn’t appear too cool or warm. Gamma was a bit off at a gamma curve of 2.1, while a gamma curve of 2.2 is preferred. That means content can look a tad brighter than intended, though I struggled to notice it.\n\nSharpness is good thanks to the monitor’s 14-inch display panel and 1920×1200 resolution. Images and videos look crisp and small text looks nice. With that said, it’s not difficult to find portable monitors with a higher resolution, so the Dell’s sharpness doesn’t stand out.\n\nDell Pro 14 Plus HDR image quality\n\nThe Dell Pro 14 Plus doesn’t support HDR. That could seem odd, as many inexpensive portable monitors support it. Support doesn’t guarantee quality, though, and portable monitors typically lack the brightness and color performance needed to make HDR stand apart from SDR.\n\nShoppers looking for good HDR will need to buy a desktop monitor—and a rather expensive one, at that.\n\nDell Pro 14 Plus motion performance\n\nI don’t think anyone will be surprised to learn the Dell Pro 14 Plus isn’t great for games. It has a 60Hz refresh rate and quotes a gray-to-gray pixel response time of 7 milliseconds, which is relatively high (IPS LCD gaming monitors have response times as low as 1 millisecond). Motion blur is noticeable behind fast moving objects and scrolling text can be difficult to read.\n\nWarranty\n\nPortable monitor warranties are almost universally bad, but the Dell Pro 14 Plus is an exception. It has a three-year warranty with Dell’s Advanced Exchange Service (AES), which promises to ship a replacement monitor within one business day if Dell determines that your monitor needs to be replaced. There are companies, such as ViewSonic and HP, that provide three-year warranties on some portable monitors, but I’m not aware of any that offer coverage similar to Dell’s AES at no extra charge.\n\nShould you buy the Dell Pro 14 Plus?\n\nThe Dell Pro 14 Plus Portable Monitor is a tough sell at its retail MSRP of nearly $370. That’s towards the high end for a portable monitor, and the Pro 14 does have a few features (like USB-C Power Delivery pass-through and a premium carrying case) that feel worth the money.\n\nHowever, the monitor’s IPS-LCD display struggles to deliver image quality competitive with OLED alternatives, and the monitor lacks features I would expect from a so-called Pro display, such as color calibration and customization. That makes the Dell Pro 14 Plus hard to recommend."}

Many times, enthusiasts pick the cheapest option to save money. However, this decision can lead to problems down the road like poor build quality and limited airflow.\n\nTo help avoid these issues, we’ll walk you through the aspects you should consider when buying a PC case. We’ll also highlight top cases at various price points.\n\n1. Size and form factor are a must\n\nFirst of all, make sure you get a case that can fit all of the components. The form factor determines whether your mainboard will fit into the case. The most common options are ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX. There’s also XL-ATX and E-ATX, which are slightly larger than ATX but are rarely used in gaming PCs.\n\nLarge cases often also support small form factors, but the reverse is, of course, difficult. If you try to fit a big custom RTX 5080 into a mini-ITX case, for example, you will quickly realize that it won’t fit. So you also need to make sure that the case has enough space for all the components like the graphics cards, AIOs, fans, and power supplies.\n\nLet’s take a look at the usual case sizes. There are big towers, midi towers, mini towers, and ITX. Big towers offer the most space; all standard motherboard sizes fit in here, and often XL-ATX and/or E-ATX are also supported. With these cases, you have plenty of space for components and cable management.\n\nMidi towers are somewhat smaller; ATX boards still fit in there, but not always E-ATX. Mini-towers are more compact; only Micro-ATX and smaller will fit, and ITX systems will logically only fit ITX.\n\n2. Do all the components fit?\n\nTo check which components will fit in your PC case, you can take a look at PC Part Picker–you’ll find all the relevant information listed there. If you’re looking for a midi tower, for example, you can see all the sorting options directly.\n\nBy selecting a specific case, you can check the “Motherboard form factor” section to see what it accommodates. Everything up to E-ATX fits, but you also need to consider three additional components: Power supply unit, CPU cooler, and graphics cards.\n\nIn this case, we have an ATX power supply unit, i.e., the standard size. Please note: ATX power supply units have different depths. For compact builds, there are SFX and SFX-L power supplies. You should also check the maximum size of your CPU fan and graphics card. For the CPU fan, it’s about the height, i.e., how far the fan protrudes from the mainboard. As for the GPU, it’s the length measured from the slot bracket.\n\nYou can also see how much space your case still has and how the case is constructed. This information is usually available from PC Part Picker, but if not, you will have to look on the manufacturer’s website. Fortunately, if you toss all your desired components into the website, it’ll warn you if there are any compatibility concerns.\n\n3. Airflow, fan, AIO\n\nGetting a decent airflow isn’t rocket science, but finding the right housing for it isn’t easy and there are a few traps you shouldn’t fall into. Our recommendation? Keep it simple. Manufacturers like to come up with the fanciest “cooling solutions,” but these quickly backfire.\n\nThe principle is relatively simple. You need to get as much cold air into the housing as possible and then get warm air out again. The easiest way to do this is with a mesh front, which are perforated grilles. If you’re using an air cooler for your CPU, a mesh front is highly recommended. As a rule, two to three fans fit in there; you have a decent air throughput, and the cold air is directed straight at the GPU and the CPU cooler. Add a fan at the back that blows air out, and you have an overpressure system that is completely sufficient for most configs.\n\nSome cases also have fans pre-installed, which you can also check at Geizhals. Here you can also see which fans are compatible at which point in the case. For example, the front of a case may fit either one 140 fan, two 140 fans, or three 120 fans. If a fan is not labeled “optional,” then it’s already pre-installed.\n\nThere are other ways to create a good airflow. With an AIO, i.e., an all-in-one solution, everything looks entirely different again. We first have to see which radiators fit into the housing. At Geizhals, you can also see which radiator sizes can be placed where.\n\nIn the Corsair case (see picture above), everything up to 360 millimeters fits at the front, top, and right. At the back, where the single fan is usually located, a 120 mm AIO would also fit instead. With an AIO, a mesh front is no longer so important, unless you want to put the radiator right there.\n\nNevertheless, your components should not get too hot, so you need a proper airflow in the housing even with an AIO. However, it’s no longer important that this is orientated towards the CPU, so you should be a little more creative about where you place the fans–this is especially true for big and midi towers. However, if you’re building a compact system, you should think more about the cooling and perhaps watch a few tutorial videos.\n\n4. Connections and equipment\n\nMany people don’t pay too much attention to the connections and features when buying a case, but that’s a big mistake! There are usually USB-A, headphones, perhaps a microphone, or USB-C ports on the outside of the case. However, you should also check the exact USB standards. In addition, not all cases have front ports, which can be important.\n\nIn terms of features, as previously mentioned, you should pay attention to the presence (or absence) of pre-installed fans. You should also consider how many SSDs and hard drives you want to install. Although gaming PCs hardly need hard drives anymore, many still use at least one 2.5-inch SSD. Again, you can check Geizhals to see how much space is available, usually under “Internal.”\n\nMini tip: Cable management\n\nBefore we come to the last point, a few words about cable management. It’s difficult to tell from Geizhals how suitable a case is for cable management. You should therefore take a close look at the available product images. Pay attention to whether there are enough cable feed-throughs and whether there is enough depth at the rear for all the cables. If you have shortlisted an enclosure, take a look at a few videos.\n\n5. Quality and price\n\nFinally, let’s talk about price. How much should you spend on a decent enclosure? A decent case doesn’t have to be expensive, as many of them come equipped with all the important connections and quality fans. But a $40 case is usually made of very thin materials and may not be as well-built as a pricier one.\n\nUltimately, the case has to fit your budget. Sure, you can put together a $2,500 PC and pack it into a cheap case, but it might not look good. As a general rule, aim to spend about five to 10 percent of your budget on the case. So, for a $1,000 PC, you should look for cases in the $50-$100 range.\n\nThis is just a rough guideline, though. There are always affordable or more premium options out there. You can also look out for a sale or add cases to your wishlist for future purchases.\n\nOur recommendations\n\nHere are our recommendations for each price range:"}

It’s where crushes are confessed, inside jokes are born, and girls’ trips are planned. There’s no exhilaration like the feeling when everyone is active, your phone buzzing a mile a minute as joke after joke rolls in.\n\nHowever, as much as I love these moments, with our busy everyday lives, they’re few and far between. It’s hard to keep up with all your messages, and we all have that one friend who’s so often absent from the group chat that when they do chime in, it feels like when your coolest cousin finally graces the family function with their presence. If you’re reading this and can’t think of that person, chances are it’s you, and you’re most likely one of the following zodiac signs. Here are the four signs most likely to completely ghost the group chat.\n\nLeo\n\nIt’s not that Leos aren’t always talking to others—it’s just that they’re more focused on what’s happening IRL than reacting to every message in the group chat. As they’re off living their own adventures, they probably forget their phone even exists, much less remember to respond to texts. However, when they’re in between living out plotlines from a movie, they will chime in for a quick recap. But they’re gone just seconds after brain-dumping, distracted by new plans. While we definitely miss the daily chatter from Leos in a group chat, you can always count on them to provide insane updates to hold you over while they’re ghosting.\n\nCancer\n\nUnlike Leos, Cancers can’t blame always being on the go for why they haven’t responded. But these homebodies need to recharge their social battery, even if the interaction is happening digitally. Cancers might go through periods of feeling overwhelmed by the constant texts and retreat into their shell until they’re ready to interact again. They’re also incredibly sensitive, and with body language and tone lost in text, it’s possible they take a lighthearted joke a little too personally and decide to ghost as punishment. However, when Cancers are active in the chat, they’re the best listening ears ready to impart their wisdom when friends need to vent.\n\nPisces\n\nPisces spend their time daydreaming, not religiously checking their text messages. They probably see your text and totally mean to respond, but then a distraction comes along, and they flit to the next idea. They don’t intentionally ghost the group chat, but they’re pretty notorious for doing just that. When they do check in, they’re so overwhelmed by the number of missed messages that they’ll probably just jump in wherever the conversation is now. If you’ve ever had a friend ask a million questions about plans, only to respond with “scroll up for all the information,” that’s a classic Pisces move. They prefer phone calls and FaceTimes, where you can talk for hours over texting any day.\n\nCapricorn\n\nCapricorns will never miss a work email, but trying to get them to respond to girls’ trip planning? That’s another story. They have a to-do list a mile long and lofty goals, so when they get stressed, the first thing to go is the group chat. Keeping all their balls in the air means they rarely have the time to dedicate to texting. But just because they might not text you back doesn’t mean they don’t care. They’ll always find time to squeeze in in-person drinks with their besties between meetings and projects."}

A sense that is available to all human beings walking the earth, yet one we have been brainwashed to ignore. This man was brave enough to trust his own intuition.\n\nIt is all entangled in the science of quantum physics. We are all connected, we all innately KNOW right from wrong, yet some have chosen to ignore this feeling, this sense, and others have dove head first into cognitive dissonance in order to prove themselves right, when it does nothing of the sort.\n\nIt seems many people want to be proven right, more than they want to keep themselves and their families safe. Even if it leads to atomic weapons being deployed as a result, wiping out the human race in the process.\n\nMany religions are geared towards “proving” prophecies. So much so that they are making them happen themselves.\n\nThis is idiotic, for wisdom and intellect are not the same.\n\nLieutenant Stanislav Petrov\n\nStanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov is a name many of us many never have heard of, which just goes to show the inverted ways of this world at this present time.\n\nHe was a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Force who was the duty officer at the command center for the Oko nuclear early-warning system when the system reported that a missile had been launched from the United States, followed by up to four more.\n\nThe Oko (Eye) nuclear site is a Russian missile defence early warning system which was at the time under the control of the Soviet Union. The system uses the detection of the missiles exhaust fumes to identify when they are on target to hit Russia.\n\nOn the 26th December 1983 Petrov was the duty officer in command of the system, he had taken over from another officer who had called in sick. Just imagine what might have happened if Petrov was not called in and the other officer had been on duty.\n\nPerhaps there is some sort of divine providence helping humanity out after all.\n\nOn the 26th December 1983 the system reported that a ballistic missile had been launched from the United States. The report then followed up that another four more missiles were on their way to Russia.\n\nWe were heading into a Nuclear war, according to this system and Lieutenant Petrov was the man that fate would choose to react to this warning.\n\nPetrov was in shock but his common sense and intuition told him that if the United States were going to launch ballistic/nuclear missiles into Russia, they would not just send a few, they would deploy all of them in one go.\n\nPetrov had a choice to make, a choice that could result in the death of millions in both Russia and the United States as well as any other country that got sucked into what would likely be WW3, a nuclear war in fact.\n\nThis one man decided that the computer system was wrong, that this technology had gone wrong and that what he was seeing was not the truth. A human being took the responsibility away from the machine and in reality likely saved billions of lives, if not humanity itself.\n\nHis subsequent decision to disobey orders, against Soviet military protocol, is credited with having prevented an erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the United States and its NATO allies that would have likely resulted in a large-scale nuclear war. An investigation later confirmed that the Soviet satellite warning system had indeed malfunctioned. Because of his decision not to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike amid this incident, Petrov is often credited as having “saved the world” – Wikipedia\n\nWhat the Soviet’s system was actually reading was cloud covering the moon which gave the system the impression that missiles had been launched.\n\nThis was an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile which was primarily used to deliver Nuclear war heads. The launch of which was set to trigger a nuclear response from the Soviet Union.\n\nBelow is the error that had happened:\n\nIt was subsequently determined that the false alarm had been created by a rare alignment of sunlight on high-altitude clouds above North Dakota and the Molniya orbits of the satellites, an error later corrected by cross-referencing a geostationary satellite. – Wikipedia\n\nThis man is a true hero, but of course the world doesn’t celebrate ordinary men like Petrov, even though he could have practically save the world.\n\nI mention this story not to highlight the man, although this should be done as much as possible, but to show you how dangerous it is when we start to buy into the pure insanity that technology is more intelligent than man.\n\nThis is why the likes of Elon Musk, Ray Kurzweil and many others are in my view, anti human lunatics and part of a technocratic death cult.\n\nIt was Stanislav Petrov’s humanity and common sense that override the soulless technology that was about to blow the world up, and itself with it.\n\nThe A.I Death Cult\n\nIf the above account is not clear evidence that believing that technology can out think man is a ticket to death and destruction, then I don’t know what is.\n\nTranshumanist Ray Kurzweil was hired by Googles Larry Page to “work on new projects involving machine learning and language processing”. He has openly stated that by 2029 A.I would outthink any person.\n\nThe rhetoric of this man is a simply a weak and shallow sales pitch. These systems are created by man, they are controlled and programmed by man and cannot outsmart the creator.\n\nWhat many do not understand is that this belief system comes from an anti human death cult that goes back thousands of years. In more recent times we have the X Club with Thomas Huxley, the grandfather of Aldous and Julian. These are Transhumanist’s which is the more modern word for eugenics, a word coined by Julian Huxley himself.\n\nElon Musk is simply the modern-day poster boy for the X Club."}
