As our dirty turncoat strategy game columnist Sin Vega briefly explores in her review for Eurogamer, the game's Age structure, which hands you a new culture at intervals in each campaign, is reminiscent of Humankind's Era transitions.\n\nDevelopers Firaxis have elsewhere observed that the impression of Civ cribbing notes from Humankind is an unfortunate coincidence. According to an interview with executive producer Dennis Shirk last year, the Civ 7 team came up with the concept on their own, pitching it to parent company 2K Games mere days after Amplitude unveiled Humankind. It's also, of course, worth reiterating that as a historical 4X, Humankind takes plenty of cues from older Civilizations. Still, Amplitude co-founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis was tickled pink when he saw Humankind cited in Civ 7 reviews. \"That was probably the best compliment I ever got when I read some of these articles on Civ 7,\" he told me during an interview about Amplitude's forthcoming Endless Legend 2, adding \"I did not see that coming, to be frank.\"\n\nWhile they're obviously competitors, and have never done any kind of formal collaboration, de Waubert de Genlis says Amplitude and Firaxis largely get on and are enthused by each other's work. \"Sometimes we have conventions where we meet some programmers, some designers, we chat, and it's always cool, because it's always very good stuff,\" he told me, when I asked if the two teams had ever gotten together to bandy around features. \"But we could see from a while ago that already they were following [our work]. And it was very exciting for us, being much smaller at the time, and still is today. I mean, Firaxis was, in many ways, the reason for me to become a designer, originally. So when these people look at my games, it's very surprising.\"\n\nBeing compared to Civilization can be tricky, of course, in terms of managing the expectations of players and publishers. The 4X is fundamentally a \"niche\" genre, de Waubert de Genlis argued, and few specimens beside Civ are capable of shifting millions before launch. Amplitude's games tend to have a \"small bump\" at first, he said, gathering a healthy following over the coming months.\n\n\"Basically Civilization is like 16 or 17 million players on Civ 6, I think,\" he spelled out. \"Then most of our 4Xs are around 2 million-ish, Humankind is at 3.5 million. So it's big, but still far away from the 17 million. And then if you look at the other 4Xs that are not Amplitude or not Civ, the best ones would be... I'd say it depends if you take Paradox as [the same kind of] 4X or not, because they're real time. If you take turn-based 4X, very quickly you go down to the very small numbers. So it is difficult.\"\n\nNonetheless, de Waubert de Genlis says Amplitude have never felt any pressure to out-perform Civilization - even from Humankind publisher Sega, their parent company until November last year. \"Sega were not really telling us, you know, we had to be Civilization because, you know, it's a 25 year franchise, or more, maybe 30 year franchise,\" he said. \"And you can't overnight become Civilization.\"\n\nWhether they originate from Civ or a smaller, feisty Civlike, I'm keen to see more Age or Era-style mechanics in strategy games. Back in 2021, Nate Crowley (RPS in peace) called jumping Eras \"possibly Humankind's greatest strength\", allowing the player to switch rails and transform, say, a culture greased by gold into one fuelled by research. \"This on-the-fly redefinition of your entire gameplan, and the fact that it's a necessity rather than an option, is a masterstroke,\" he wrote. \"The more I play, the more fundamentally brilliant a mechanic I realise it is, and on this front at least, I don't feel like a dick in saying Humankind blows Civ out of the water.\"\n\nI'm not sure Civ 7 players are as keen about the implementation of Ages. Here is another chunk from traitorous opportunist Sin's Eurogamer review: \"The first two ages close with escalating crises that force you to choose negative modifiers (evil doppelgangers of social policies, which are unlocked with culture instead of science) until the act break. It's a move towards narrative - an unpredictable challenge to make the game - and you - less rote. In practice, they're either irrelevant or deeply irritating.\"\n\nThe broad thinking behind Eras and Ages is to keep breaking players out of their ruts over the course of a mammoth campaign. I think that's a noble aim, even if the execution is muddled. Endless Legend 2 is trying something similar with the tidefall mechanic, which peels back the ocean at intervals to reveal new navigable areas. You can read more about that in my Endless Legend 2 hands-on."}

Now modification company ColorWare has a solution to that problem, but it’s going to cost you.\n\nThanks to ColorWare’s clever customization, you can get an Apple Pencil Pro in one of seven Crayola crayon-inspired colors: black, mint (green), pink, purple, red, yellow, and white. In addition to the colors, the Pencils look exactly like Crayola crayons with a matte-painted wrapper adorned with the trademark black oval. In a nod to its inspiration, ColorWare cheekily warns, “Do not sharpen.”\n\nHowever, the unique paint job will cost you. Specifically, it’ll cost you $86 more than the Apple Pencil Pro MSRP. ColorWare charges $215 for one of the new Crayon Pencils, which is something of a bargain over the non-Pro Number 2 Pencil, which also sells for $215 but is a mod of the cheaper 2nd-gen Pencil. The $215 MSRP doesn’t include shipping, which varies by location.\n\nColorWare also sells a variety of modified Apple products, including a Mac mini Retro in Light and Dark, starting at $899, a premium of $300 over the standard Mac mini. It’s worth noting that the customization voids the standard Apple warranty, though ColorWare offers its own 1-year parts and labor warranty.\n\nIf you’re interested, the Apple Crayon Pros are expected to ship at the end of April."}

Sign up for it here.\n\nWhen the couples therapist inevitably asks, I’ll have an answer ready: The trouble began in August 2017, when my boyfriend and I moved in together, and I quickly revealed myself to be an absolute ding-dong at loading the dishwasher.\n\nI am not what you would call “precise” or “tactical” in really any aspect of my life, but certainly not in front of an open dishwasher. I lack the structural engineer’s mind for space optimization, or maybe I lack the functional adult’s patience to figure it out. I don’t totally understand how the water moves around in there, or how the soap gets dispersed. (Also, because we’re being open and honest with one another, I have never been sure about prerinsing, though I do get the sense that the rules have changed recently?) I don’t have a philosophy about what should go on the top or the bottom—I basically just put things in the first semi-logical place I see, close the door, smash some buttons, and hope for the best. I walk away and hear my plates rattle.\n\nJudging by the sheer volume of dishwasher-loading advice, commentary, and anxiety on the internet, I am not alone in any of this. There are YouTube videos with titles such as “You’re Doing It Wrong!” and “Passive Aggressive Tutorials.” There are articles broken out by brand and by subtopic, thousands of words devoted to the intricacies of scraping, stacking, sorting, eco-washing, half loads, knives, pots, plastic, and more. There is a post from a woman who doesn’t understand how her “genius” husband “can do ANYTHING, but load a dishwasher sensibly,” and one from a person whose wife does it like “an escaped mental patient.” There are Wirecutter articles explaining how to use one’s dishwasher better, and people who write into Wirecutter to complain that they don’t like the way the dishwashers in those articles’ photos have been loaded. There are so, so many guides for couples who can’t stop fighting about the dishwasher, a large number of which suggest that the issue might not be the dishwasher at all but perhaps something with its roots in childhood.\n\nRead: A $700 kitchen tool that’s meant to be seen, not used\n\nSure, but I actually think the dishwasher itself is a great place to start. It is uniquely confounding. No one is standing in front of her refrigerator, flummoxed as to where to put the milk. The American household is not being ripped apart by arguments about the correct way to operate the oven. But last year, when YouGov asked 38,000 American adults about how cutlery should be loaded into the dishwasher, no single approach achieved a majority. Maybe it’s no wonder that the dishwasher is the most underused major kitchen appliance: In 2020, just under 90 million American homes had a dishwasher, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration; 19 percent of them were used zero times a week.\n\nDishwashers are finicky: Loading them right depends on what kind of dishes you have, what kind of mess you have, and what kind of dishwasher you have. They’re also inscrutable—a black box, sometimes literally. “You close the door; you don’t know what you’re gonna get until you open it,” Carolyn Forté, who has worked for more than 40 years at Good Housekeeping and currently runs its Home Care and Cleaning Lab, told me. We can’t see our dishwashers doing their job, so most of us don’t know how they work. “Some people even think it fills up with water,” Forté said, to illustrate this point. I chuckled along knowingly, but the truth is, if she had told me that’s exactly how a dishwasher works, I wouldn’t have been surprised. I was talking with her, in fact, because I’d decided enough was enough. It was time to finally understand the dishwasher.\n\nAs soon as I started trying, one sentence began to haunt me. People repeated it to me; it showed up over and over when I searched online for information about dishwashers and dishwasher conflict. It was this: “In every relationship, there’s one person who loads the dishwasher like a Scandinavian architect, and one who loads it like a raccoon on meth.”\n\nIt’s the kind of trope-y Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus aphorism that bounces around the internet like a beach ball at an outdoor concert, endlessly rediscovered and reshared. The dishwasher makes for evergreen online humor for the same reason it acts as a password for entry into low-stakes conversation with just about any other adult: It’s incredibly relatable.\n\nIn that same YouGov poll from 2024, more than a third of respondents admitted to having disagreements with others about dishwashing best practices. The issue comes up in group chats, on web forums, and even, occasionally, in couples-therapy sessions that the famed psychologist Julie Gottman facilitates. Andrea Barnes, who covers large cleaning appliances for Wirecutter, told me the emails she gets about the dishwasher are much more “social” and “behavioral” than the ones about other appliances. In January, Forté invited Reddit users to ask her anything about dishwashers. She received hundreds of questions, more than Good Housekeeping has ever gotten for a Reddit AMA. A large number started with the poster invoking a spouse’s or a roommate’s wrongheaded approach to the dishwasher and asking Forté to adjudicate. “There’s a lot of psychology behind the dishwasher,” she told me. “There’s a lot of angst.”\n\nRead: The marriage lesson that I learned too late\n\nThe dishwasher is not just the weird wet box we share our homes with—it’s the site of so many of our cultural and individual values. Loading the dishwasher is, don’t get me wrong, about loading the dishwasher, but I’ve come to understand that it is also about efficiency and optimization, space and time, cleanliness and disgust. The Scandinavian architect’s dishwasher is a beautiful thing, but it’s also, in a certain light, self-indulgent and fussy, more art project than act of service. The stimulant-addled raccoon’s is arguably something much worse: negligent and unsanitary, evidence of a failed commitment to the family. (To be clear, if the raccoon is a woman, especially a mother, society looks even less kindly on her.) In both cases, the criticism is not completely superficial. Dishes are what we eat off of, after all, and eating is how we take care of one another.\n\nHousehold maintenance has been freighted and intimate since we’ve had houses to maintain. “Our homes and our home possessions and what meaning we ascribe to them is one of the most personal things we can experience,” the sociologist Michelle Janning told me. (In 2017, she published a book on the subject, The Stuff of Family Life: How Our Homes Reflect Our Lives.) The internet has encouraged only more comparison, and more consternation—more places to argue, more pressure to make even the most banal parts of our lives beautiful. “The message everywhere is that our home is supposed to be a signature representation of who we are,” Janning said. “Our home is supposed to be the most meaningful, almost sacred place and space that we hold near and dear.”\n\nBringing any kind of technology into these sacred spaces saves time, but it can also alienate us from the labor of caring for those we love. Maybe this is why so many people don’t trust, don’t use, or want to command their dishwashers. “The strong opinions associated with how to do it could be people trying to retain some semblance of control in a world where technological devices are doing things so much for us,” Janning said of the dishwasher. “I do wonder if there’s a little bit of fear of losing the humanity associated with our domestic lives.”\n\nRead: Put your husband in the kitchen\n\nGottman speculated that part of the reason people get so upset about the dishwasher is that dishwashers are “there to just do a mundane task—very mundane. There’s no creativity within the scope of the dishwasher.” Cooking is fun; cleaning up is not. But it must be done, and done well, in order for the rest of the household to function.\n\nSome years ago, Sandrine Bèrges, a professor at the University of York, in England, became interested in applying concepts we usually use to understand countries and governments to the smallest unit of human coexistence: the home. She called it “the philosophy of domesticity.” In 2015, she published a paper that asked, “Is Not Doing the Washing Up Like Draft Dodging?”\n\nObviously, seeing this sent a shiver down my spine. I don’t think being bad at the dishwasher is a moral failure, but being unwilling to get better at it might be. It isn’t cute—it’s poor citizenship in the very small nation that is my home. It’s learned helplessness, voluntary ignorance, bad vibes. I have lived in my apartment since 2022 and have been, the entire time, confused by my dishwasher (a Bosch, 2018 model, slightly dented but in fundamentally good shape). I have rolled my eyes at it, disrespected it, misused it, and left its loading to my boyfriend (a John, 1988 model, slightly dented but in fundamentally good shape). Three years is a long time to live with something you’re not very nice to. Eight is even longer.\n\nAfter weeks of talking with cleaning experts, watching internet tutorials, reading cleaning guides, peering into my dishwasher as though it were an ancient cave, and, at one point, asking one of the aforementioned cleaning experts to do the same over Zoom, here is what I can tell you about how to load the dishwasher.\n\nEach machine has two or three spray arms, at least one on the bottom and one on the top: This is where the detergent-y water comes from. If you are confused about how to load your dishwasher, understanding this is half the battle. Barnes, the Wirecutter expert, recommends looking into your dishwasher and seeing where the holes are, “just to get an idea of the pattern of your own dishwasher.” (She, and almost everyone else I spoke with, also recommended reading the manual.) “And you want to make sure that when you load the dishwasher that those streams of water are going to hit.” Crucially, this means that you should not be overloading your dishwasher. Make sure your plates are separate, your bowls aren’t nested, and nothing is sitting where water can’t reach it.\n\nThe second thing is to make sure your stuff is stable in the machine, because if it isn’t, it’s much more likely to break. The general rule is that the bottom rack is subject to more forceful spray, so you want your sturdier items there and your daintier stuff on the top. Clean your filter periodically, if you have one (you might not!). If your dishwasher smells, you can run a sanitizing cycle with vinegar, baking soda, or one of the many specialized dishwasher-cleaning products on the market. Also, no cast iron, no wood, no crystal, nothing with delicate painted-on decorations, like china with a metallic rim.\n\nRead: Doing dishes is the worst\n\nHere’s the third big thing: Rinsing isn’t necessary. Oma Blaise Ford, a senior executive editor at Better Homes and Gardens, told me that overrinsing is “one of the most common mistakes in modern dishwasher loading.” She recommends scraping leftover food off your dishes into the trash with a rubber spatula and immediately loading them into the machine, without even turning on the faucet. (The main exception, she said, is fatty proteins such as peanut butter or eggs, which tend to be stubborn.)\n\nThis is, indeed, new advice—I wasn’t wrong. Perhaps part of our problem is that the way dishwashers work has fundamentally changed since many of the people currently fighting with their loved ones about dishwashers learned to use them. In the late 2000s, according to Barnes, we switched from phosphate detergent to enzymatic detergent, which works like a little Pac-Man, eating dirt and making room for the soap to do its job. “So if you don’t leave a little bit of food for these enzymes,” she told me, “you run the risk of it starting to break down other materials,” such as your actual dishes. Everyone thinks the way they grew up loading the dishwasher is correct, so this one is hard for people to hear, but she was insistent: The detergent is designed to work on a little bit of dirt. You need, she said, to “trust the machine to do its job.”\n\nIsn’t it amazing how the answer to everything is always the same? Pay attention. Trust the process. Seek to understand. Question your assumptions. Read a book.\n\nHere is what else I can tell you about dishwashers: They are a miracle. The modern water-pressure-powered dishwasher was invented by Josephine Cochran, a socialite who was expected to host a lot of dinner parties but hated cleaning up after them. She built a dishwasher in the shed behind her house and, in doing so, helped kick off what Helen Keller would later call the “startling revolution” that rearranged women’s domestic responsibilities, and therefore their sense of what was possible. Today’s dishwashers save about 230 hours of labor a year: Nearly 10 days, every year, to do something other than wash the dishes. In a water-scarce world, they are even more valuable. Rinsing dishes takes one and a half to two gallons of water a minute; a really good dishwasher, Barnes told me, takes three to five gallons a wash.\n\nDishwashers do a lot for us, and we hold them to a high standard. “I’ve seen people put, like, a Thanksgiving dinner in their dishwasher and then be surprised their filter is clogged, or that dishes don’t come out clean,” Barnes told me. We take them for granted: “People get so angry and obsessed with the ones that don’t work,” she said, “and we often overlook how many of them do a great job.”\n\nLast week, I purposefully subjected myself to the real-life version of an anxiety dream. I stood in front of my boyfriend and my parents—three of the people who mean the most to me, and who have offered the most, uh, feedback on my dishwasher-loading abilities—and tried to do the thing. Plates on the bottom, don’t cram too much in there, think about the spray: Honestly, it wasn’t that bad. I thought about the hard work, and the help, required to keep a home. The dishes came out clean."}

Content with product specs, comparisons, “best of” lists, and vendor details consistently got the highest citation rates.\n\nThe study notes:\n\n“This preference appears consistent with how AI engines handle factual or technical questions, using official pages that offer reliable specifications, FAQs, or how-to guides.”\n\nOther content types struggled to get cited as often:\n\nNews and research articles each got only 5-16% of citations.\n\nAffiliate content typically stayed below 10%.\n\nUser reviews (including forums and Q&A sites) ranged between 3-10%.\n\nBlog content received just 3-6% of citations.\n\nPR materials barely appeared, typically less than 2% of citations.\n\nCitation Patterns Vary By Funnel Stage\n\nAI platforms cite different content types depending on where customers are in their buying journey:\n\nTop of funnel (unbranded) : Product content led at 56%, with news and research each at 13-15%.

Five questions heading into the draft", "fullContent": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nPaige Bueckers won an NCAA title with UConn on April 6 and has barely stopped moving since: from talk shows to endorsements to Sunday's championship parade in Hartford, Connecticut. Monday will mark her biggest moment since hoisting the national championship trophy as she is expected to be picked No. 1 in the WNBA draft by the Dallas Wings.\n\n\"It's been insane -- a lot of celebrating, a lot of reflecting,\" Bueckers said in a recent video call with media. \"Then to already have this transition into my next stage, the WNBA, it makes you really stay present in what you're doing.\"\n\nBueckers is one of 16 players invited to New York for the draft (7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN). After Bueckers, how might the rest of the 38-pick draft go? Here are some of the biggest questions heading into Monday night.\n\nWhich player will the Seattle Storm select at No. 2?\n\nKevin Pelton: The smart money is on French center Dominique Malonga. WNBA scouts are high on the 19-year-old, who has averaged 18.5 points and 11.0 rebounds for ASVEL in the EuroCup against WNBA players. At 6-foot-6, Malonga doesn't fill a need like Notre Dame guard Sonia Citron would for the Storm, who landed the No. 2 pick as part of a trade sending Jewell Loyd to the Las Vegas Aces. But with a unique opportunity to add a star talent -- with its highest pick since taking Breanna Stewart No. 1 in 2016 -- Seattle will likely favor the best player available.\n\nAndre Snellings: Malonga is the most likely pick, but don't completely discount Citron. She has the size, shotmaking and defensive versatility to quickly develop into an impact guard in the WNBA. The Storm have the core of a contending team as soon as this season if they improve their guard play, and Citron could be a big help on that front for a team that already projects elite interior play from Ezi Magbegor and Nneka Ogwumike.\n\nMichael Voepel: Malonga's size, youth and potential likely make her too valuable for the Storm to pass up. They had similar success taking Australia's Magbegor as a 19-year-old in 2019.\n\nplay 1:59 Scott credits team effort after Ole Miss' blowout win Madison Scott drops 15 points and adds three blocks in the Rebels rout of Ball State and discusses her leadership role along with the Rebels' toughness.\n\nIf Paige Bueckers doesn't win WNBA Rookie of the Year, who will?\n\nCharlie Creme: LSU's Aneesah Morrow. If she goes to the Washington Mystics or Golden State Valkyries in picks 3 through 6, Morrow will get plenty of playing time and opportunity to put up solid numbers, even if they don't necessarily come efficiently. She's undersized at 6-1, but the rebounding instincts and relentless pursuit of the ball that defined Morrow's college career won't disappear because the competition is better. Morrow won't have a double-double in 83% of her games like she did this season at LSU, but she will lead all rookies in that category.\n\nplay 1:04 Hailey Van Lith leads TCU to first Elite 8 with 26 points Hailey Van Lith goes off with 26 points and nine rebounds in TCU's 71-62 Sweet 16 win over Notre Dame.\n\nEric Moody: USC's Kiki Iriafen. She's a future star. Known for her footwork, post scoring and defense, Iriafen stepped up for USC after JuJu Watkins' ACL injury. In her first season with the Trojans after three years at Stanford, Iriafen averaged 18.0 points and 8.4 rebounds, shooting 49% from the field. A unanimous All-Big Ten first-team pick, as well as a third-team AP All-American, she led USC to a Big Ten title and the Elite Eight. Iriafen's versatile, two-way game -- reminiscent of A'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart -- makes her a strong rookie of the year contender, especially if she lands with a team such as the Washington Mystics.\n\nWhich team's pick(s) are you most interested in watching?\n\nPlay Fantasy Women's Basketball Fantasy Women's Basketball is now open!

The Sun hit the rebuild button this offseason, dismantling their roster after six consecutive years of reaching the WNBA semifinals or better, including two trips to the Finals. Connecticut would be wise to consider adding a point guard with one of its back-to-back picks at Nos. 7 and 8 in the first round -- someone the Sun could build around. Georgia Amoore would be an excellent addition. The former Kentucky guard is a great decision-maker on the court and excels in the pick-and-roll.\n\nVoepel: The Mystics. With pick Nos. 3, 4 and 6 in the first round, the Mystics have a chance to get three very different types of players. The franchise has new leadership after 12 seasons under Mike Thibault as general manager (he was also coach for 10 years). We will get a look at the decision-making of GM Jamila Wideman and coach Sydney Johnson. Plus, what the Mystics do with half of the top six selections will have a big impact on the rest of the first round.\n\nWhich team has the potential to win the draft?"}

The Las Vegas Aces' first-round selection was rescinded in 2023 after a WNBA investigation found the franchise violated league rules regarding impermissible player benefits and workplace policies.\n\nplay 1:11 Before They Were Next: Paige Bueckers Relive Paige Bueckers' rise from her early days in Minnesota to becoming a national champion at UConn.\n\nUConn Huskies | point guard | 6 feet tall | senior\n\nBueckers just added a national championship to her résumé, and she is the easy choice at No. 1. She finished her senior season averaging 19.9 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.6 assists while shooting 53.4% from the field and 41.9% from 3-point range. She can be a franchise-changing player.\n\n2. Seattle Storm: Dominique Malonga\n\nFrance | center | 6-6\n\nMalonga, 19, played for France in the Olympics last summer and dunked in a game in November. She has competed in France's top professional women's league since she was 15 and is currently averaging 15.4 points, 10.3 rebounds and 1.5 assists for Lyon Asvel Feminin. Her ceiling seems high.\n\nUSC Trojans | power forward | 6-3 | senior\n\nThe Mystics, who are in rebuilding mode with a new coach and a new general manager, have three of the top six picks. Iriafen had a breakout season as a junior at Stanford. As a senior at USC, she averaged 18.0 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.8 assists as the Trojans won the Big Ten regular-season title and made the NCAA tournament's Elite Eight.\n\n4. Washington Mystics: Sonia Citron\n\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish | shooting guard | 6-1 | senior\n\nCitron averaged 14.1 points, 5.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists as a senior, helping Notre Dame win a share of the ACC regular-season title and reach the Sweet 16. She was a first-team All-ACC pick and was on the league's all-defensive team. Her defensive versatility helps her case to be a lottery pick.\n\nLSU Tigers | small forward | 6-1 | senior\n\nMorrow led Division I in rebounding (13.5 per game) and double-doubles (30) this past season while also averaging 18.7 points. LSU advanced to the Elite Eight in both her campaigns there after she transferred from DePaul. Morrow made just 24 3-pointers during her two seasons in Baton Rouge, but the 53 treys she knocked down as a sophomore at DePaul show they can be part of her repertoire at the pro level.\n\n6. Washington Mystics: Shyanne Sellers\n\nMaryland Terrapins | point guard | 6-2 | senior\n\nSellers' ability to play point guard at her size could be one of her best advantages for being picked in the first round. She shot a career-best 40.8% from 3-point range this past season while averaging 14.4 points, 3.8 rebounds and 4.1 assists for the Terps, who made the Sweet 16.\n\n7. Connecticut Sun: Ajsa Sivka\n\nSlovenia | point forward | 6-4\n\nThe Sun are in rebuilding mode with new coach Rachid Meziane from France. Sivka, 19, plays for the Slovenian national team and competes professionally in France. She could either be a draft-and-stash prospect or play in the WNBA this season. Her size and shooting ability are assets.\n\n8. Connecticut Sun: Aziaha James\n\nNC State Wolfpack | shooting guard | 5-9 | senior\n\nJames is one of the most explosive perimeter scorers available in this draft. She helped NC State make the Final Four in 2024 and the Sweet 16 this year. As a senior, she averaged 17.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 2.6 assists. She has become a reliable 3-point shooter over her past two seasons, hitting 75 and 76 treys, respectively.\n\nKentucky Wildcats | point guard | 5-6 | senior\n\nAmoore averaged 19.6 points, 2.3 rebounds and 6.9 assists while playing an SEC-high 36.7 minutes per game this past season for the Wildcats. She spent her first four seasons at Virginia Tech, which she helped lead to the 2023 Final Four. Amoore made 408 3-pointers in college, shooting 35.6% from behind the arc.\n\nplay 2:23 Harmoni Turner's highlight-reel plays from the 2024-25 season Relive some of Harmoni Turner's best plays of Harvard's 2024-25 season.\n\nSouth Carolina Gamecocks | power forward | 6-3 | senior\n\nFeagin was a late bloomer in college, in large part because she was playing behind future WNBA lottery picks Aliyah Boston and Kamilla Cardoso. This past season, an injury to Ashlyn Watkins brought Feagin more to the forefront, and she responded as the Gamecocks advanced to the national championship game. Feagin might just be scratching the surface of what she can do and could join Cardoso with the Sky.\n\nTCU Horned Frogs | point guard | 5-foot-9 | graduate student\n\nThe Sky traded with Minnesota on Sunday to add this pick. Van Lith could join Angel Reese, her teammate at LSU from the 2023-24 campaign, in Chicago. Van Lith also could be an understudy to one of the best point guards in WNBA history, Courtney Vandersloot, who returned to Chicago this year. Van Lith was Big 12 player of the year and league tournament MVP this past season. She averaged 17.9 points, 4.6 rebounds and 5.4 assists in leading the Horned Frogs to their first Elite Eight.\n\n12. Dallas Wings: Saniya Rivers\n\nNC State Wolfpack | small forward | 6-1 | senior\n\nRivers is a do-it-all type of offensive player who also could develop into a strong defender at the next level. She won an NCAA title with South Carolina as a freshman before transferring to NC State. She helped lead the Wolfpack to the Final Four last season and the Sweet 16 this year, when she averaged 11.9 points, 6.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.6 steals and 1.3 blocks.\n\nplay 0:16 Rayah Marshall comes up with big block for USC Rayah Marshall protects the rim with a strong rejection.\n\nSecond round\n\n13.

It helps give semantic meaning and context to entities in webpages using a common language. As of 2024, over 45 million web domains markup web pages using it.\n\nWhy add structured data to my app?\n\nThere are two main reasons why adding structured data to our application or website is desirable:\n\nIt can help search engines and other bots better understand what our content is about and what entities it represents and relates to. It can improve our site's visibility and, with it, boost the click-through-rate we get on the SERPs, helping us rank better and get more traffic.\n\nA more in-depth understanding of our content and its entities can help us search engines rank our content for queries we wouldn't otherwise rank for.\n\nStructured data presents many benefits, but it's not considered a ranking factor. It can indirectly help us rank better if the improved CTR results in a good user experience, which signals to search engines that our content fulfills what users were expecting. This means that we can add structured data to a webpage without any noticeable improvements in rankings or traffic. Consider it an indirect means to an end.\n\nWhat will we build?\n\nFor this article, we will be building upon Buk, a dummy book directory application we already used for articles like adding a sitemap to a Rails app.\n\nWe will be adding structured data to this application to enrich the information we give to search engines.\n\nEven though we could add the structured data using partials or even add it directly to the Book or Article models, we will be using the schema_dot_org gem which helps us with data validation and typing which can be crucial, especially if our site has many pages and entities.\n\nConcretely, we will add the following entities to the appropriate pages:\n\nWebSite with the SearchAction to represent the ability to search for books from the homepage.\n\nOrganization\n\nBreadcrumb\n\nBook\n\nReview\n\nIf you like to see how everything is implemented, you can check the application repository.\n\nSetup\n\nWe can use many formats to represent structured data for our Rails application.\n\nBut, to make things simple and follow search engine's recommendations, we will stick to JSON-LD which stands for “JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data”.\n\nThis means that we declare structured data as JSON and include it within the head of the document we're trying to add structured data to.\n\nThere are many ways to achieve this with Rails. We will focus on how to add SD with and without a gem:\n\nAdding structured data without a gem\n\nIn Rails, there are a couple of ways we can add SD without using a gem.\n\nThe first way is to declare the data as a hash in a given model:\n\nclass User def to_json_ld { \"@context\" : \"https://schema.org\" , \"@type\" : \"Person\" , \"name\" : username , \"url\" : \"https://avohq.io/accounts/ #{ id } \" } end end\n\nThen, we can add this Person information to another type schema: as an author of an Article for example or add it directly to the <head> of a page:\n\n<%= content_for ( :head ) do %> <script type= \"application/ld+json\" > <%= @user . to_json_ld %> </script> <% end %>\n\nAnother way is to use namespaced POROs to represent the entities we want to include as structured data.\n\nEvery object of this type would have to be defined within the Schema namespace to avoid collisions, and it would have to receive an object on the constructor and respond to the to_json_ld method:\n\nmodule Schema class ImageObject include Rails . application . routes . url_helpers def initialize ( image ) @image = image end def to_json_ld { \"@context\" : \"https://schema.org\" , \"@type\" : \"ImageObject\" , \"url\" : rails_blob_url ( @image ), \"height\" : @image . metadata [ :height ], \"width\" : @image . metadata [ :width ] } end private def default_url_options Rails . application . config . action_mailer . default_url_options || { host: 'localhost:3000' } end end end\n\nmodule Schema class Article def initialize ( article ) @article = article end def to_json_ld { \"@context\" : \"https://schema.org\" , \"@type\" : \"Article\" , \"author\" : @article . user . to_json_ld , \"name\" : @article . title , \"url\" : \"https://avohq.io/blog/ #{ @article . slug } \" , \"image\" : Schema :: ImageObject . new ( @article . cover ). to_json_ld , \"description\" : @article . excerpt , \"articleBody\" : @article . content , \"publisher\" : { \"@type\" : \"Organization\" , \"name\" : \"AvoHQ\" , \"url\" : \"https://avohq.io\" }, \"datePublished\" : @article . published_at , \"dateModified\" : @article . updated_at , } end end end\n\nThis will produce a result that looks like the following:\n\n{ :@context => \"https://schema.org\" , :@type => \"Article\" , :author => { :@context => \"https://schema.org\" , :@type => \"Person\" , :name => \"erozas\" , :url => \"https://avohq.io/accounts/1\" }, :name => \"Microservices: When to Adopt and When to Avoid\" , :url => \"https://avohq.io/blog/microservices-when-to-adopt-and-when-to-avoid\" , :image => { :@context => \"https://schema.org\" , :@type => \"ImageObject\" , :url => \"http://localhost:3000/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--0c8a98de44ad2cc4a753561d6e8b54a53bf7f5bc/3.webp\" , :height => 630 , :width => 1200 }, :description => \"A pragmatic guide to evaluating whether microservices architecture is right for your organization and project needs.\" , :articleBody => \"Microservices architecture has become something of a buzzword in software development circles, often presented as the inevitable evolution beyond monolithic applications. However, the reality is more nuanced—microservices offer significant benefits in certain contexts while introducing unnecessary complexity in others.\" , :publisher => { :@type => \"Organization\" , :name => \"AvoHQ\" , :url => \"https://avohq.io\" }, :datePublished => \"2025-03-21 01:46:12.979479000 UTC +00:00\" , :dateModified => \"2025-03-22 01:54:11.865287000 UTC +00:00\" }\n\nNotice that we're using a mix of techniques: a call to .to_json_ld on the User model for the Person schema and the Schema::Image PORO to represent the ImageObject schema.\n\nWe would then have to define a class for every possible schema type.\n\nSolving the problem like this is perfectly fine but, unless we're cautious, we can create invalid schemas or provide the wrong types of values.\n\nThat's why we will use a gem that helps us with validation and typing:\n\nWe could also define schemas directly within partials and call it a day. However, if we foresee our application needing to define more schemas in the future, using POROs or a gem is probably a better decision to keep the code organized and more maintainable.\n\nAdding structured data using a gem\n\nWe will use the schema_dot_org gem, which allows us to define and validate the structured data to make sure we're rendering the right things.\n\nLet's start by adding and installing the gem:\n\n$ bundle add schema_dot_org && bundle install\n\nAt the date of writing this, the gem produces invalid results because it adds a contextForValidation attribute to the generated JSON.\n\nThere's an open PR that resolves the issue, but it hasn't been merged yet, so we will be using a fork of the gem:\n\ngem \"schema_dot_org\" , git: \"https://github.com/erozas/schema-dot-org\"\n\nBesides addressing the issue with the contextForValidation , this fork also will help us later when we start defining the schemas.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves, let's start by seeing how the gem works:\n\nThe gem comes with some predefined entities that we can find under the lib/schema_dot_org directory of the gem.\n\nSome of these entities are: Person , Place , Product , WebSite , Organization , SearchAction , ItemList , among others.\n\nBut, unlike with the previous PORO approach, the classes that define the entities are not expecting model instances or other Ruby objects, but the individual attributes like name or url .\n\nTo define a Person we would do something like this:\n\nperson = SchemaDotOrg :: Person . new ( name: \"Exequiel Rozas\" , url: \"https://erozas.com\" , same_as: [ \"https://github.com/erozas\" ]) person . to_json_ld\n\nWhich produces the following output:\n\n\"<script type= \\\" application/ld+json \\\" >\n\n{ \\\" @context \\\" : \\\" https://schema.org \\\" , \\\" @type \\\" : \\\" Person \\\" , \\\" name \\\" : \\\" Exequiel Rozas \\\" , \\\" url \\\" : \\\" https://erozas.com \\\" , \\\" sameAs \\\" :[ \\\" https://github.com/erozas \\\" ]}\n\n</script>\"\n\nWe can then include that directly in the document's <head> or use the content_for helper:\n\n<%= content_for ( :head ) do %> <%= @person %> <% end %>\n\nLike we said before, the gem only has a limited set of schema types, but we can extend them by defining new classes within the SchemaDotOrg namespace that inherit from SchemaType .\n\nLet's start by adding an Article schema that also receives an ImageObject :\n\n# app/models/schema_dot_org/image_object.rb module SchemaDotOrg class ImageObject < SchemaType validated_attr :url , type: String validated_attr :height , type: Integer validated_attr :width , type: Integer end end\n\nWe can add many more attributes for the ImageObject, but we will stick to these because the process is basically the same for every type of attribute we want to add.\n\nNow, we define the Article schema:\n\n# app/models/schema_dot_org/article.rb module SchemaDotOrg class Article < SchemaType validated_attr :author , type: SchemaDotOrg :: Person , allow_nil: true validated_attr :name , type: String validated_attr :url , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :image , type: SchemaDotOrg :: ImageObject , allow_nil: true validated_attr :article_body , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :description , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :publisher , type: SchemaDotOrg :: Organization , allow_nil: true validated_attr :date_published , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :date_modified , type: String , allow_nil: true end end\n\nBesides primitives like String it can also receive a Person , an Organization or an ImageObject .\n\nWe can define as many schemas as we like, as long as we follow the conventions.\n\nNow that we know how to use the schema_dot_org gem, let's start by adding the site-related structured data:\n\nBesides the JSON-LD format, we can add structured data to a page using the Microdata and RDFa formats, which use attributes to represent the desired entities and their properties. However, both of these formats have their limitations and are more error-prone. Search engines recommend JSON-LD for structured data.\n\nGraph array to group entities\n\nOccasionally, we need to define various entities that might be grouped together.\n\nFor example, a page representing an article might include the WebSite , WebPage , Article and BreadcrumbList entities.\n\nTo achieve this out of the box, we would need to define many <script> tags, which is redundant and clutters the page with unnecessary code.\n\nLuckily, we can use the @graph property to declare a set of entities that are grouped together via the @id property.\n\nOut of the box, the schema_dot_org gem doesn't have support for @graph or @id properties, but the fork we installed does.\n\nThe way to declare a graph is by first declaring schemas for individual properties and passing them to the SchemaDotOrg.create_graph class method:\n\nperson = SchemaDotOrg :: Person . new ( name: \"Exequiel Rozas\" , id: \"https://avohq.io/#person\" ) site = SchemaDotOrg :: WebSite . new ( name: \"Avo HQ\" , url: \"https://avohq.io\" , id: \"https://avohq.io/#website\" ) graph = SchemaDotOrg . create_graph ( person , site ) graph . to_json_ld\n\nWhich produces the following output:\n\n< script type = \\ \" application/ld+json \\\" >\n\n{ \\\" @context \\\" : \\\" https://schema.org \\\" , \\\" @graph \\\" :[{ \\\" @type \\\" : \\\" Person \\\" , \\\" @id \\\" : \\\" https://avohq.io/#person \\\" , \\\" name \\\" : \\\" Exequiel Rozas \\\" },{ \\\" @type \\\" : \\\" WebSite \\\" , \\\" @id \\\" : \\\" https://avohq.io/#website \\\" , \\\" name \\\" : \\\" Avo HQ \\\" , \\\" url \\\" : \\\" https://avohq.io \\\" }]}\n\n</script>\n\nNow, we can define multiple related schemas within a single object and without the need to duplicate tags.\n\nThe @id property is used to uniquely identify an item within a webpage. It allows our properties to reference each other. For example, if we had an Article entity with an author property, we could give the author an @id that references the Person entity without the need to duplicate anything, thus communicating to search engines that the author of the article is actually the person defined below.\n\nSchema types\n\nThere are currently around 800 different schema types that we can use to define entities in our applications.\n\nNaturally, not all of them are supported by search engines, but adding the appropriate schema to our web pages can make a difference.\n\nHowever, some schemas are a safe bet for almost every website.\n\nWe will start by covering those and then adding appropriate schemas for the example application shown above.\n\nWebsite and organization schemas\n\nThe first structured data we might want to add is the one that's related to the site in general.\n\nFor this, we will use four schemas: Organization , WebSite , WebPage and ImageObject .\n\nThe organization contains information about the actual company behind the website, the website represents the actual site or collection of web pages, the web page represents the current page which is the home page or any other static page or our website and the ImageObject represents the OpenGraph image.\n\nThe gem doesn't have schemas for the WebPage and the ImageObject but we've already defined the latter, so let's create the WebPage schema:\n\n# app/models/schema_dot_org/web_page.rb module SchemaDotOrg class WebPage < SchemaType validated_attr :name , type: String validated_attr :url , type: String validated_attr :description , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :inLanguage , type: String , allow_nil: true end end\n\nNow, we will define the schema in a controller action. For our example, the controller is the StaticController and we will use a filter to assign the schema to an instance variable:\n\nclass StaticController < ApplicationController before_action :set_schema , only: [ :home ] def home @books = Book . all end private def set_schema organization = SchemaDotOrg :: Organization . new ( name: \"Buk\" , url: \"https://buk.com\" , email: \"hello@buk.com\" , logo: \"https://buk.com/logo.png\" , telephone: \"+1234567890\" ) web_site = SchemaDotOrg :: WebSite . new ( url: \"https://buk.com\" , name: \"Buk\" , about: \"Buk is a book sharing platform where users can gather and share their favorite books with each other.\" , publisher: organization ) web_page = SchemaDotOrg :: WebPage . new ( url: \"https://buk.com\" , name: \"Buk\" , description: \"Rediscover the joy of reading using Buk to explore a world of possibilities with our carefully curated collection of books.\" , in_language: \"en-US\" , ) @schema = SchemaDotOrg :: GraphContainer . new ([ organization , web_site , web_page ]) end end\n\nNext, we create a partial that we will use to display the schema script on the document's head whenever rendered on a view:\n\n<%# app/views/shared/_schema.html.erb %> <%= content_for :head do %> <%= schema %> <% end %>\n\nNow, we can render the partial in the home page and have the schema show in the document's head:\n\n<%# app/views/static/home.html.erb %> <%= render \"shared/schema\" , schema: @schema %>\n\nWe can avoid using the schema partial and just declaring the content_for :head on every page we need the schema to show up. That's ultimately up to taste.\n\nAs a side note, we can add this schema to other pages of our site by changing the WebPage schema and using specific descriptions for those pages.\n\nArticles\n\nAfter adding the schemas for the home page, let's add a schema for articles.\n\nWe could use the Article or the BlogPosting schema type. In our case, we will use the first.\n\nBecause the gem doesn't define any of those, we will add an Article type:\n\nmodule SchemaDotOrg class Article < SchemaType validated_attr :id , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :author , type: SchemaDotOrg :: Person , allow_nil: true validated_attr :name , type: String validated_attr :url , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :image , type: SchemaDotOrg :: ImageObject , allow_nil: true validated_attr :article_body , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :description , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :publisher , type: SchemaDotOrg :: Organization , allow_nil: true validated_attr :date_published , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :date_modified , type: String , allow_nil: true end end\n\nAfter defining it, we can add the schema in the controller like we did before:\n\nclass ArticlesController < ApplicationController before_action :set_schema , only: [ :show ] # Rest of the code def set_schema organization = SchemaDotOrg :: Organization . new ( name: \"Buk\" , url: \"https://buk.com\" , email: \"hello@buk.com\" , logo: \"https://buk.com/logo.png\" , telephone: \"+1234567890\" ) author = SchemaDotOrg :: Person . new ( name: @article . user . username , url: user_url ( @article . user ), ) image = SchemaDotOrg :: ImageObject . new ( url: url_for ( @article . cover ), width: @article . cover . metadata [ \"width\" ], height: @article . cover . metadata [ \"height\" ] ) article = SchemaDotOrg :: Article . new ( name: @article . title , url: article_url ( @article ), description: @article . excerpt , article_body: @article . content , date_published: @article . published_at . to_time . iso8601 , publisher: organization , image: image , author: author ) @schema = SchemaDotOrg :: GraphContainer . new ([ organization , article ]) end end\n\nNow, we add it to the show partial just like we did before, and we should have a nice script that outputs what we require.\n\nBut we're missing the structured data for breadcrumbs, and we have those in our example application blog:\n\nLet's see how we could add them:\n\nBreadcrumbs\n\nWe can define structured data for breadcrumbs, using the BreadcrumbList markup to hold the list of breadcrumbs and the ListItem element to define the actual breadcrumbs and the Thing markup to represent the item property of the list item.\n\nThe schema_dot_org fork already defines those, so let's create the breadcrumbs.\n\nOur breadcrumb structure is simple: Home that points to the root page, the Blog item that points to the blog index and the Article that points to the current article.\n\nAs we will be including the schema in the ArticlesController everything from the Article schema is the same except we will also pass a BreadcrumbList object to the @graph :\n\ndef set_schema organization = SchemaDotOrg :: Organization . new ( name: \"Buk\" , url: \"https://buk.com\" , email: \"hello@buk.com\" , logo: \"https://buk.com/logo.png\" , telephone: \"+1234567890\" ) author = SchemaDotOrg :: Person . new ( name: @article . user . username , url: user_url ( @article . user ), ) image = SchemaDotOrg :: ImageObject . new ( url: url_for ( @article . cover ), width: @article . cover . metadata [ \"width\" ], height: @article . cover . metadata [ \"height\" ] ) article = SchemaDotOrg :: Article . new ( name: @article . title , url: article_url ( @article ), description: @article . excerpt , article_body: @article . content , date_published: @article . published_at . to_time . iso8601 , publisher: organization , image: image , author: author ) home_breadcrumb = SchemaDotOrg :: ListItem . new ( position: 1 , name: \"Home\" , item: root_url ) blog_breadcrumb = SchemaDotOrg :: ListItem . new ( position: 2 , name: \"Blog\" , item: blog_url , ) article_breadcrumb = SchemaDotOrg :: ListItem . new ( position: 3 , name: @article . title , item: article_url ( @article ) ) breadcrumbs = SchemaDotOrg :: BreadcrumbList . new ( item_list_element: [ home_breadcrumb , blog_breadcrumb , article_breadcrumb ] ) @schema = SchemaDotOrg :: GraphContainer . new ([ organization , article , breadcrumbs ]) end\n\nNow, we can also generate structured data for any types of breadcrumbs on our site.\n\nBooks\n\nGiven that our example application is about book sharing, let's add markup for a Book .\n\nLet's start by creating the class to generate the desired markup:\n\nmodule SchemaDotOrg class Book < SchemaType validated_attr :name , type: String validated_attr :author , type: SchemaDotOrg :: Person , allow_nil: true validated_attr :description , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :publisher , type: SchemaDotOrg :: Organization , allow_nil: true validated_attr :isbn , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :date_published , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :genre , type: Array , allow_nil: true validated_attr :about , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :in_language , type: String , allow_nil: true validated_attr :thumbnail , type: SchemaDotOrg :: ImageObject , allow_nil: true end end\n\nThen, in the BooksController we define the schema just like we did before:\n\n# app/controllers/books_controller.rb class BooksController < ApplicationController before_action :set_book , only: [ :show ] before_action :set_schema , only: [ :show ] private def set_schema author = SchemaDotOrg :: Person . new ( name: @book . author_name , url: author_url ( @book . author ), ) publisher = SchemaDotOrg :: Organization . new ( name: @book . publisher . name , url: @book . publisher . url , logo: url_for ( @book . publisher . logo ), ) thumbnail = SchemaDotOrg :: ImageObject . new ( url: url_for ( @book . cover ), ) @schema = SchemaDotOrg :: Book . new ( name: @book . title , author: author , publisher: publisher , isbn: @book . isbn , date_published: @book . published_at . to_date . iso8601 , genre: @book . genres . map ( & :name ), description: @book . description , thumbnail: thumbnail , ) end end\n\nProducts\n\nThere are really no products in the example application, but we could add the appropriate SD with the Product schema type.\n\nThe markup can have many properties, but the gem includes name , description , image , url and a special offers property that accepts an AggregateOffer to communicate about offers or price reductions.\n\nSo, we will define the set_schema method to show how it can be done:\n\n# app/controllers/products_controller.rb def set_schema images = [] @product . images . each do | image | images << SchemaDotOrg :: ImageObject . new ( url: url_for ( image ), width: image . metadata [ \"width\" ], height: image . metadata [ \"height\" ] ) end offer = SchemaDotOrg :: AggregateOffer . new ( lowPrice: @product . discounted_price , highPrice: @product . price , priceCurrency: \"USD\" , offerCount: @product . count_on_hand ) @schema = SchemaDotOrg :: Product . new ( name: @product . name , description: @product . description , image: images , url: product_url ( @product ) ) end\n\nPlease note that the AggregateOffer uses camel case for the keys.\n\nNow we have structured data for our products too!\n\nFAQ Page\n\nTo add the Frequently Asked Questions markup, we will define a FAQPage schema type and then use the Question and Answer schemas to handle the actual questions.\n\nIn the example application, we defined the actual questions in a YAML file stored in the config directory that looks like this:\n\nfaqs: - question: What is Buk? answer: Buk is a revolutionary book sharing platform that connects readers, allows book exchanges, and helps you discover new literary adventures. - question: How does book sharing work? answer: Users can list books they're willing to share, request books from others, and arrange local or digital exchanges. Our platform ensures a safe and seamless sharing experience.\n\nOnce we have that, we set the schema in the controller:\n\n# app/controllers/static_controller.rb class StaticController < ApplicationController # Rest of the code def faq faqs_path = Rails . root . join ( \"config\" , \"faqs.yml\" ) @faqs = YAML . load_file ( faqs_path ) @schema = set_faq_schema end private def set_faq_schema questions = [] @faqs . each do | question | answer = SchemaDotOrg :: Answer . new ( text: question [ 'answer' ] ) question = SchemaDotOrg :: Question . new ( name: question [ 'question' ], accepted_answer: answer ) questions << question end SchemaDotOrg :: FAQPage . new ( name: \"Frequently Asked Questions\" , main_entity: questions ) end end\n\nAfter passing the schema to the schema partial, we get an appropriate schema markup for our FAQ section\n\nGoing further\n\nShowcasing every possible type of schema in an article like this is not really practical.\n\nYour application might have many other types of schemas or implement the same we showed here a bit differently.\n\nAs long as you follow the convention of defining your new schemas within the SchemaDotOrg namespace and have the classes inherit from SchemaType you should be able to define as many as you want.\n\nThe best place to see how the schemas should look like is the official Schema.org website, don't hesitate to explore it and search for your desired markup there.\n\nNote: not every schema defined in the schema.org specification is supported by search engines or produces enriched search results. As a starting guide, check the structured data schemas supported by Google guide.\n\nSchema validation\n\nBefore publishing changes to the structured data of our sites, we need to make sure that it's properly formatted and valid.\n\nTo do so, we can use the schema.org validator, where we can test by URL or by pasting the generated code fragment from the json+ld script.\n\nIf we've added our site to the Google Search Console like we taught in the sitemaps in Rails article, we can check the Enhancements section to see how our structured data is indexed and if there are any errors with it.\n\nIn my experience, even if we add the appropriate markup to pages that are indexed they won't necessarily show up in this section, but errors tend to appear so keeping an eye on it is advisable.\n\nSummary\n\nAdding structured data to our website can help us with our SEO efforts by making it easier for search engines to understand what our content is about and the entities it represents.\n\nThere are around 800 different schema markups to represent entities that might be present in our websites or applications, but not all of them are picked by search engines to produce enriched search results.\n\nTo add structured data to a Rails application, we used a fork of the schema_dot_org gem, which adds the ability to support the @graph property and some extra schema types we needed.\n\nBecause structured data is essentially JSON, we can achieve the same results by using POROs or even partials, but the gem has some nice features like validations.\n\nBefore adding structured data to our application, make sure that it's valid by using a validator service so we can avoid wasting crawl budget unnecessarily.\n\nLastly, there are many browser extensions that allow us to inspect the JSON+LD markup for websites. Use them to learn how others are solving the issue, or even find out if your competitors are using structured data and how.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the article and that you can implement structured data in your Rails applications.\n\nHappy coding!"}

It has become “normal” – like a pastime. We are enjoying it – which is helped by movies from Hollywood often “projected planning movies” by our media, by countless books and articles; wars conflicts and killing have become “the norm” of our daily lives.\n\nTrump Concocted the ‘Tariffs Hoax’ to ‘Decouple’ with China\n\nBy Mike Whitney, April 13, 2025\n\nThe Trump tariff extravaganza was never about trade deficits, reindustrialization, or bringing jobs back to America. It was always about China. Now that Trump has either eased or lifted the tariffs on 90 other countries, we can see what’s actually going on.\n\n“Peace on Planet Earth”: Cancel Your NATO Membership. It’s Easy? “Say Goodbye” to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\n\nBy Prof Michel Chossudovsky, April 14, 2025\n\nUS-NATO-Israel’s “humanitarian wars” consist of crimes against humanity, genocide and the destruction and fragmentation of entire countries: Palestine, Vietnam, Cambodia, Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Ukraine, … not to mention military coup’s, regime change, color revolutions, … poverty and famine.\n\nShould Iran Bend Knee to Donald Trump?\n\nBy Kim Petersen, April 13, 2025\n\nIran had agreed to a deal — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and Germany — collectively known as the P5+1 — with the participation of the European Union. The JCPOA came into effect in 2016. During the course of the JCPOA, Iran was in abidance with the deal. Nonetheless, Trump pulled the US out of the deal in 2018.\n\nElection 2025: Canadian Sovereignty at Stake!

During my time as provost, I’ve been able to address challenges I care deeply about and make meaningful progress. However, the issues that have arisen in recent days are not ones I can solve, and I don’t feel the same passion for them.”\n\nHis statement didn’t explain what these recent issues are, and Chapel Hill spokespeople didn’t provide further information beyond campus chancellor Lee Roberts’s April 3 announcement that Clemens had decided to step down.\n\nClemens will return May 16 to being the Jaroslav Folda Distinguished Professor of Physics and Astronomy, Roberts said in that announcement. Clemens has been provost since early 2022, starting under former chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz, who’s now president of Michigan State University. Roberts credited Clemens with, among other things, helping establish the School of Data Science and Society, the Program for Public Discourse, and SCiLL.\n\nSCiLL was established after Chapel Hill’s Board of Trustees passed a resolution in January 2023 asking the campus administration to “accelerate its development” of this new school. The then–board chair called SCiLL an effort to “remedy” a shortage of “right-of-center views” on campus. Controversy quickly ensued. Faculty said they didn’t know a whole school was in development.\n\nThe Republican-controlled State Legislature then passed a law requiring Chapel Hill to establish the school and hire 10 to 20 faculty from outside the university, plus make them eligible for tenure. It became one of many civics or civil discourse centers—critics have called them conservative centers—that Republican lawmakers and higher education leaders have established at public universities in recent years.\n\nIn January 2025, Clemens canceled the latest SCiLL tenure-track faculty searches before reversing course days later. Articles in The Assembly and the conservative Real Clear Investigations have now implied that Clemens’s departure was connected to his involvement in the disagreements over hiring within SCiLL.\n\nClemens, a self-described conservative, had been an advocate for SCiLL. The Real Clear Investigations article was titled, before the headline was changed, “In North Carolina, Academic Conservatives Have Met the Enemy and It Is … Them.”\n\nIn his Friday statement, Clemens said, “I look forward to returning to the faculty to resume work on optical design technology, with a particular focus on applications for the SOAR telescope and astronomy. This will allow me to spend more time in the classroom—an aspect of academic life I have greatly missed.”"}

Most recommendations focused on methods and results. At the time, articles were published on paper and supplements were limited. Infrastructure to register clinical trials and to share other artefacts (eg, data, code) had not been invented. The first CONSORT update in 2001 described trial registration as desirable, but not essential.2 When a CONSORT update in 2010 added trial registration as a checklist item,3 opportunities for sharing data and code were still relatively new.4 SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 2013, the first reporting guidelines for trial protocols, introduced recommendations about data and code sharing.5\n\nCONSORT 2025 (doi:10.1136/bmj-2024-081123) and the soon-to-be published SPIRIT 2025 (doi:10.1136/bmj-2024-081477) update and replace previous versions of these essential reporting guidelines.67 These updates are the first since guidance for statistical analysis plans was published in 20178 and the first since data and code sharing became relatively commonplace. Updating both guidelines in tandem has led to helpful clarifications and harmonisation. The updated guidelines also include some new items. An especially welcome section on “Open science” recommends reporting whether other research artefacts are publicly available. This new section highlights an important shift from focusing on journal articles towards a contemporary understanding of “reporting” as sharing a collection of research artefacts associated with a study.\n\nThe CONSORT 1996 checklist fit on half a page. The developers predicted the checklist would grow as researchers identified more information considered important for all randomised clinical trials and for specific types of these trials.1 Indeed, the detailed SPIRIT 2025 and CONSORT 2025 checklists are 24 and 12 pages long, respectively.910 Consequently, it might be difficult to follow the CONSORT 2025 guidance that every checklist item be reported “somewhere in the article, with sufficient detail and clarity.” Additionally, the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network library—an online repository of reporting guidelines (https://www.equator-network.org)—identifies 32 CONSORT and 10 SPIRIT extensions for different types of research questions (eg, dose finding1112), frameworks (eg, non-inferiority13), designs (eg, cluster randomised,14 n-of-1 trials1516), interventions (eg, social and psychological,17 herbal18), outcomes (eg, harms,19 surrogates,2021 patient reported2223), and article sections (eg, abstracts,24 intervention descriptions,25 outcomes2627). Editors had already begun to complain in 2015 when 10 CONSORT extensions had been produced.28 Multiple extensions now apply to most randomised clinical trials, so users are typically advised to consult four or five documents.29\n\nThe current system is more comprehensive than CONSORT 1996, but it is not always easy to use. Notably, it is no longer clear where and how all the recommended items should be reported so that every reader can find the information that matters to them. While CONSORT 1996 focused on the main text of journal articles—even recommending the organisation of information under five suggested subheadings—CONSORT 2025 stops short of stating which items are essential for the main text and which might be included in supplementary materials. Consequently, it might be difficult for authors, peer reviewers, and editors to implement its recommendations. Clearer guidance is needed about what information is essential for the main text of every journal article and where the other recommended information belongs.\n\nThere is limited evidence that reporting guideline endorsement is associated with more complete reporting,30 and the developers of SPIRIT 2025 and CONSORT 2025 rightly argue that reporting quality remains suboptimal.31 Standards for assessing adherence to SPIRIT 2025 and CONSORT 2025 could help bridge the gap between recommendations and practice. For some items, the presence or absence of information might be easy to assess (eg, allocation ratio). For other items, it is unclear what constitutes complete reporting (eg, background and rationale, trial settings). The developers say that SPIRIT 2025 and CONSORT 2025 are not tools for assessing trial quality (eg, risk of bias), but many studies have and will use reporting guidelines to assess reporting quality, including important studies by the developers.323334353637 Moreover, SPIRIT and CONSORT developers have rightly argued that reporting guidelines should be used by peer reviewers and editors to improve reporting quality.3839 Objective criteria for assessing adherence to each item could help users understand, assess, and implement recommendations. Rules would also support the use of emerging technologies to facilitate manuscript writing and review, such as artificial intelligence.\n\nIt might not be feasible for a few thousand words in a journal article to constitute a complete report of a randomised clinical trial. However, infrastructure and technology better support research transparency today than in 1996. Expanding the scope of reporting guidelines to include recommendations for sharing and organising multiple research artefacts would promote greater transparency and openness. For example, the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines40 provide a framework that journals and others can use to promote research transparency. TOP describes seven practices that support verification of study results (eg, sharing study protocols, statistical analysis plans, research materials, analytical code, and data). Future updates to SPIRIT and CONSORT could articulate how those practices should be implemented to make randomised clinical trials verifiable and useful for multiple interest holders. For example, it might be unrealistic to include all items about statistical methods in the main text, but it should be possible to understand and audit analyses using freely available and permanent copies of statistical analysis plans and code. Future updates might state that journal articles should include links to intervention protocols. Within ethical and legal limits, individual data should be available to support reanalysis, new research, and evidence synthesis. A truly complete report of a randomised clinical trial would include all these things in addition to a journal article summarising the methods and results.\n\nThe new “Open science” section underscores that reporting a randomised clinical trial is not synonymous with publishing a journal article. SPIRIT, CONSORT, and other reporting guidelines should continue to develop recommendations about the collection of artefacts that are essential for different study types. SPIRIT and CONSORT are guidelines for randomised clinical trials, so updates and extensions should describe the minimum information to be included in the main text of articles summarising randomised clinical trials, other artefacts that should be available for every randomised clinical trial, and what information those artefacts should contain to meet the needs of various interest holders. To improve implementation and research, objective standards for assessing adherence to each item in these reporting guidelines should be developed."}

But that doesn’t bode well for the remainder of the year, they added.\n\nGartner said that the PC industry shipped 59 million units during the first quarter of 2025, a 4.8 percent increase from a year ago. Last week, rival IDC said that 63.2 million PCs shipped, a 4.9 percent increase.\n\nWhat seems to be clear is that the PC industry “front-loaded” shipments, trying to get them inside the United States before tariffs could take effect.\n\n“The growth in the PC market in the first quarter of 2025 was driven by the surge in shipments in two key markets, the U.S. and Japan, but for different underlying reasons,” said Rishi Padhi, research principal at Gartner, in a statement. “In the U.S., the PC market experienced a surge in shipments as vendors increased inventory in anticipation of tariff announcements, resulting in 12.6 percent year-over-year growth. Despite this increase and the subsequent strong topline growth, underlying end-user demand remained cautious, even with the added boost from enterprises upgrading PCs for Windows 11.”\n\n“The market is clearly showing some level of pull-in in the first quarter this year as both vendors and end-users brace for the impact of US tariffs,” said Jean Philippe Bouchard, a research vice president with IDC, last week. “In a first quarter still relatively untouched by tariffs, the entire ecosystem attempted to accelerate the pace of deliveries to avoid the first round of U.S. tariffs and expected volatility for the remainder of the year.”\n\nTariffs imposed by the Trump administration currently sit at 20 percent, after a few days where administration statements went back and forth. In a “clarification of exceptions” announced Friday, Trump seemed to imply that the PC, component, and smartphone industry would not be subject to tariffs. But Sunday night, Trump declared on Truth Social that there was no exception, and that tariffs would still remain at 20 percent. Other Chinese imports are tariffed at 125 percent, at press time.\n\nLenovo, HP remain on top\n\nWorldwide, Lenovo remains the top PC vendor, with a 9.6 percent year-over-year increase in shipments that took it to 15.2 million units in the first quarter of 2025. Lenovo was followed by HP, Dell, Apple, Acer, and Asus, Gartner said.\n\nWithin the U.S., HP remains on top, Gartner said, with a 13.1 percent shipment increase that took it to 4.1 million shipments. Dell, Lenovo, and Apple followed it, essentially divvying up the entire U.S. market somewhat equally.\n\nIDC said last week that it believes that the downdraft of tariff pressures will offset the potential for growth by the Windows 10 replacement cycle, which will force consumers and businesses to replace Windows 10 PCs by October or risk them falling out of support.\n\n“While many are still unpacking the details from the April 2 tariff announcement, it’s safe to say most are reevaluating what the following months will look like,” said Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Device Trackers, in a statement. “So far, our supply chain checks haven’t shown any drastic shifts, but this isn’t surprising as it’s almost too volatile to make drastic business decisions. Companies are undoubtedly evaluating everything from inventory on hand, capacity to manufacture by location, possible reroute opportunities to lower import tariffs, and for some, their deal discussions with the U.S. administration. When it comes to hardware like PCs and similar devices, we still maintain the view that most (if not all) price increases will get passed directly to the consumer.”"}

But the pace isn’t fast enough for Microsoft’s liking, apparently, and the company really wants people to upgrade to Windows 11 sooner than later.\n\nGet Windows 11 Pro for cheap Windows 11 Pro\n\nIn addition to sending out reminder emails about Windows 10’s impending doom and nudging users to recycle their old Windows 10 PCs while buying newer Windows 11 systems, Microsoft has recently published a new support page in an attempt to persuade users to switch over ASAP, reports Windows Latest.\n\nPublished earlier this month, the article in question is titled “7 tips to get the most out of Windows 11” and includes seven reasons why you should switch from Windows 10 to Windows 11:\n\nNew Start menu\n\nSnap layouts\n\nMultiple desktops\n\nWidget board\n\nFocus sessions\n\nWindows Hello\n\nImproved dark mode\n\nA lot of these productivity-boosting features in Windows 11, and we’re honestly surprised they stopped at seven. There are actually plenty of other lesser-known Windows features only available in Windows 11, which could further tempt Windows 10 users to hop over.\n\nBut the biggest reason to make the upgrade? Well, Microsoft is officially ending support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, after which the operating system will grow more vulnerable to security flaws and miss out on whatever features and improvements come to Windows 11.\n\nIf you’re still on Windows 10, you can upgrade to Windows 11 free of charge if you have a compatible system. Otherwise, you’ll have to seek out one of these other solutions to save your Windows 10 PC."}

It’s a small, golden drive with a gleaming, premium sheen. Is it unusual? Yes. Is it a head turner and a conversation starter? Also yes!\n\nBrilliant appearance aside, this is a super speedy portable SSD. In fact, when we reviewed the Beetle X31, we gave it a 4.5-star rating exactly because it was one of our top 10Gbps performers. “The SK Hynix Beetle X31 turned in a faster aggregate time than the 10Gbps competition in our 48GB transfer tests,” noted our expert.\n\nThe drive comes with a USB-C port, which means it’s widely compatible with pretty much any device in your home from your desktop to laptop, from Android devices, tablets, and gaming consoles to iPhones and more, as long as you have the right cable. But don’t worry, because the drive comes with two cables—one C-to-C and one C-to-A—as well as a transparent silicone case to give the Beetle X31 some extra protection against bumps, drops, dust, and dirt.\n\nAgain, this is close to the best-ever price we’ve seen for this super-fast portable SSD, so now’s a great time to jump on it. If SK Hynix’s 1TB model for $65 isn’t enough space for you, then you may want to look into the 2TB version on sale for $150 (was $200).\n\nSave 28% on the SK Hynix Beetle X31 portable SSD (1TB)"}

I put together websites in HTML as a teenager (which, yes, were hosted on GeoCities) and have been occasionally dabbling in Python since.\n\nYet none of my projects got very far and, apart from my early websites, I never made anything useful. My efforts all followed a familiar pattern: I’d fixate on a particular resource—like an O’Reilly book or an online course—and get started with great enthusiasm, but as I’d realize I was months or years away from creating anything remotely useful, I’d give up.\n\nI’ve used Claude AI to quickly generate a simple dice roller web app. Matt Smith / Foundry\n\nThat changed in late 2024 when my general frustration with WordPress, which I was using for my personal website, got the better of me. In a fit, I threw my website’s content plus a screenshot of it into Claude 3.5 Sonnet and asked the AI to replicate my site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To my amazement, Claude 3.5 generated a functional website. It wasn’t perfect, but after a couple hours of working with Claude, I wound up with a website I liked even better than its WordPress predecessor.\n\nMy approach was exactly what Karpathy described. I didn’t read the code, nor did I really try to understand it (though I did have to think a bit about how the featured articles carousel works). That aside, I just told Claude what to do, copy-and-pasted the results in VSCode, saved the file, and reloaded my browser to see what changed. And it worked.\n\nA work-in-progress screenshot of my Pico-8 puzzle game and the vibe-coded source. Matt Smith / Foundry\n\nBut the most important part? It was fun! Fun enough that I’ve since tried my hand at several other coding projects. I made an online tool to track initiative and roll dice when DMing tabletop roleplaying games, I made another tool to simplify rolling dice in Battletech, and I’m currently making a puzzle game for the Pico-8 virtual game console. I also used AI to guide me through setting up tools that require a bit of fussing, like OpenAI’s Whisper speech-to-text model.\n\nNotably, all three projects were in different programming languages—HTML/JavaScript, Python, and Lua—none of which I’m even remotely proficient with. I’ve also dabbled in some C#, as I started to make the puzzle game in Unity before deciding it was overbuilt for my needs and swapping to Pico-8. I also toyed with turning my tabletop RPG tool into a Windows app before deciding that wasn’t helpful."}

Voice clips pretending to be Facebook/Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk emanated from speakers meant to guide the visually impaired.\n\n“Hi, I’m Elon,” said one speaker, in a reader-submitted video posted to Palo Alto Online (via Tom’s Hardware). “Can we be friends? Will you be my friend? I’ll give you a Cybertruck, I promise.” The satirical message continued, “Okay, look, you don’t know the level of depravity I would stoop to just for a crumb of approval. I mean, let’s be real, it’s not like I had any moral convictions to begin with, right?”\n\nA video showing a similar recording from “Mark Zuckerberg” took aim at Meta’s increasing presence in the AI space. “You know, it’s normal to feel uncomfortable, or even violated, as we forcefully insert AI into every facet of your conscious experience. And I just want to assure you, you don’t need to worry, because there’s absolutely nothing you can do to stop it.”\n\nOther messages claimed that Zuckerberg was proud to “undermine democracy,” “cook our grandparents’ brains with AI slop,” “[make] the world less safe for trans people,” and that Musk thinks being a cancer on society is “awesome.”\n\nThe messages were reported in Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Redwood City, where residents and visitors are undeniably aware of the huge presence that corporations like Meta, Tesla, X (formerly Twitter), and xAI have in the area. Musk, Zuckerberg, and other billionaires are facing intense public scrutiny as their companies and their personal actions—sometimes in open cooperation with the Trump administration or bowing to its demands—continue to affect Americans and others.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the city of Palo Alto, speakers at twelve intersections were affected and have been disabled. Nearby Redwood City is also affected, and deputy city manager said that staff were investigating as of Saturday evening. Exactly how this occurred—for example, was it an outside hack or was it someone with access to the cities’ infrastructures?—is not clear."}

So, when I spotted a Dell Inspiron model with a big touchscreen and 16GB of RAM, I knew I had to post it. Best Buy is offering just that today, and only today, with a $250 discount. That brings the final price of the Inspiron 15 down to just $549.99.\n\nThe Inspiron line is definitely on the budget side of things, but this one has a surprising amount of power thanks to a Ryzen 7 7730U processor with eight cores and a maximum speed of 4.5GHz. 16 gigabytes of RAM is also great at this price — that’s as low as I would go for any laptop with Windows 11, by the way. 1TB of storage and a 15.6-inch touchscreen are also rare for a laptop this affordable, and I like that there’s a full-sized HDMI port and an SD card slot.\n\nHaving said that, let me be sure to set your expectations appropriately. With a two-year-old processor and integrated graphics, this Inspiron 15 (model 3535) can handle some very basic gaming duties, but it won’t be putting out huge framerates on any recent 3D title. I also wouldn’t expect that 41-watt-hour battery life to last very long, especially with a big touchscreen. Since it has a barrel charging port, I would also say it’s a pretty good bet that it can’t charge with the USB-C port, which is definitely a bummer.\n\nThat said, this laptop might be a good candidate for cheap upgrades. According to this video, you can pop the bottom of the laptop open to access two, count ’em, two SO-DIMM slots, plus the M.2 storage slot. The AMD 7730U supports up to 64GB of RAM, and that M.2 slot should support up to 2TB of storage. Those are on the older DDR4 and PCIe 3 standards, by the way, which are a lot slower than newer laptops, but should also mean much cheaper parts. Do some checking around before you plan for upgrades, though — I’m going off official specs, so the actual laptop itself might not be able to handle those maximums.\n\nThis is Best Buy’s Deal of the Day for Monday, April 14th, and the site says the deal is good until 1 AM Eastern/10 PM Pacific. If you miss it, you can find a similar laptop (unfortunately with 512GB of storage) for $503 over at Newegg.\n\nSee our roundup of the best laptops for other suggestions.\n\nGet a Dell Inspiron 15 with touchscreen and 16GB of RAM for $550"}

Asus has since taken up the NUC mantle, but unfortunately has yet to deliver something quite the same. That said, the newest ROG NUC mini PC gives you the latest gaming laptop guts, including an RTX 5080.\n\nThe 2025 ROG NUC looks broadly similar to last year’s model, with specs that list an Intel Core Ultra 9 Arrow Lake processor, GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card (the laptop version with 16GB of GDDR7 RAM), DDR5 6400 memory with “up to” 96GB of capacity, and support for PCIe Gen4 SSDs up to 2TB in size. Precise specs are harder to nail down, but with the promo page claiming “8 performance and 16 efficiency cores” with a 5.5GHz top speed, the primary processor is likely an Ultra 9 285 or 285T.\n\nOther highlights include a dedicated SSD heatsink and HPU cooling fan, two more fans and two vapor chambers, which operate with “remarkable silence even under stress.” (I’m going to assume that “silence” is a little generous.) The desktop is a little bigger than most mini PCs to fit all those guts, measuring 11.1 inches wide, 7.4 deep, and 2.2 high (that’s 282.4 x 187.7 x 56.5 millimeters, for those of you in civilized countries).\n\nThat puts its volume at just shy of three liters, compared to 10.4 liters for a Mini-ITX case like the Fractal Design Terra. Plenty of exterior ports make up for it, with four USB-A ports, USB-C, double HDMI, double DisplayPort, and 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet on the rear, plus another USB-C and two USB-A ports on the front. Access to the interior for upgrading the SO-DIMM RAM or SSD is granted with a single thumbscrew, no tools needed.\n\nHow much is all that power and flexibility going to cost you? Quite a lot, it seems. VideoCardz.com reports the price as 24,399 RMB in China (~$3,340 USD) for the base model with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Double the storage and it hops up to just shy of 25,000 RMB (~$3,425 USD). That’s more than enough to get a powerful gaming laptop, if not one equipped with those precise parts. And how much will it cost if/when it heads to other territories? Well, that depends on a lot of different factors at the moment."}

How could anyone forget this nine-second clip of branding brilliance?\n\nWhenever I think of “branding,” I go back to my memory of the GameCube boot-up screen and the feelings of joy and anticipation it evokes. That makes a brand work — the experience behind the logo. But getting your brand experience right is incredibly hard for any marketing team. Logos, visual identities, copy, websites, social media — “brand” requires tons of attention and work.\n\nSo, I’m always on the lookout for ways to build a brand stronger, faster, and better than before.

Welcome to AI’s biggest role within marketing teams in 2025.\n\nMarketers have toyed with AI for several years. That tracks with what McKinsey has found: Most AI adoption has happened at the individual contributor level (i.e., the social media manager whipping up posts).\n\nBut, AI is showing the potential for greater strategic business value. As 2025 unfolds, I believe we’ll see a shift in tool adoption, from ICs experimenting with ChatGPT to deeper integration into everyday workflows.\n\nThe Marketing Artificial Intelligence Institute recently found that 36% of marketers have infused AI into their daily workflows. Its research also showed a profound shift from marketers just “experimenting” with AI to actually implementing it in their everyday work.\n\nMarketers deploying AI are seeing better results across their bodies of work. SurveyMonkey’s latest AI survey found that, of the marketers using AI:\n\n93% use it to generate content faster.\n\n81% use it to uncover insights more quickly.\n\n90% use it for faster decision-making.\n\nOur research shows that four out of ten marketers are using AI to write copy and outlines for long-form content. They’re also using AI to learn how to do things — not just research for articles but tutorials on writing better content or using tools more effectively.\n\nIn 2025, I think we’ll see AI become the marketing team’s branding copilot.\n\nTeams are using AI for content support and customer experience personalization already. AI in content marketing is helping to define and scale brand identities while keeping everything on-brand and consistent. AI’s role will expand, provided marketing teams better structure their internal data architectures and continue investing in AI education and training.\n\nBut that copilot piece matters. You shouldn’t concede all branding decisions to an AI partner. Instead, the best-performing marketers will learn to operate alongside their AI branding tools, leaning on its strengths while keeping human creativity and ingenuity at the heart of their brand.\n\nPro tip: How else are marketers using AI across their organizations? Download our AI Trends for Marketers report for more.\n\nWhy use AI tools for branding?\n\nWhile AI tools for branding can bring many benefits, AI is like any other tool. You need to know how, when, where, and why to use it. You wouldn’t use a hammer to drive a screw into a wall; likewise, AI used without planning and intention can stymie or even damage your brand.\n\nEfficiency and Authenticity\n\nMost talk around AI adoption focuses on efficiency gains — get more, faster, with your team. Rosier predictions from McKinsey show the potential for saving 60-70% of an employee’s time with AI tools. While efficiency is certainly part of the benefit, I don’t think efficiency alone is sufficient, especially with branding needs.\n\nGarin Hobbs, Martech Expert at InboxArmy, agrees. “AI pushes branding toward efficiency, but efficiency without intent weakens identity. I can't even count how many companies plug AI into content creation and label it innovation, yet the output lacks depth.”\n\nHobbs continues by sharing how an AI tool’s thoughtful application helped his company. “In my experience, AI works best analyzing customer sentiment at scale, then feeding those insights back into brand messaging,” he said.\n\n“Here‘s my favorite tactic: instead of letting AI write entire emails, I used it to identify specific phrases customers responded to in previous campaigns. Weaving those into fresh copy led to a 19% higher conversion rate. We were shocked — it actually worked! AI shouldn’t replace creative instincts — it should reveal patterns that inform smarter human decisions.”\n\nA branding AI tool doesn’t replace creativity (or creative talent). It supports their efforts while buying back their time and effort.\n\nHyper-Personalization of Content\n\nPersonalizing your marketing content is a bare minimum. Everyone knows “Hi, Alex!” in your email is a first name field.\n\nNow, we’re looking at hyper-personalization, which involves understanding a buyer’s individual behaviors and preferences and changing content to match. These highly customized experiences can reduce customer acquisition costs by as much as 50% and increase marketing ROI by 10-30%.\n\nBut, there’s no easy way any marketing team could hyper-personalize at a meaningful scale. Enter an AI branding tool.\n\nHowever, before you turn your AI loose, give it the structure for personalization at scale while keeping things authentic. Tristan Harris, Sr. VP of Marketing at Next Net Media, shares more.\n\n“For businesses navigating this balance, conduct a brand touchpoint audit identifying moments of genuine differentiation versus functional interactions — this reveals where AI implementation preserves rather than dilutes authenticity,” he said. “The most effective approach I've seen connects authentic human expertise with AI-driven personalization at scale rather than choosing between them.”\n\nHarris also points to the importance of voice in this process: “Create clear AI usage guidelines for customer-facing content that specify which brand elements must remain human-crafted, preventing the subtle voice erosion that has damaged many well-intentioned automation efforts.”\n\nBrand Consistency at Scale\n\nHarvard Business Review reports a well-defined brand strategy, with consistency across every touchpoint, can drive 10-20% increases in annual revenue. A branding AI tool is basically purpose-built to protect consistency wherever your brand appears.\n\nBut, as Nirmal Gyanwali, Founder & CMO and WP Creative, notes, the buck does not stop at the AI tool.\n\n“We‘ve had to be intentional about how we integrate AI. It’s incredibly useful for tasks like generating content outlines, analyzing customer sentiment, helping us spot patterns we might have missed,” he said. “But when it comes to storytelling and brand voice, that's all human.”\n\nBalancing the human aspect of a brand while staying consistent is a high-wire act that involves putting faith in your team to represent you well.\n\n“I‘ve learned that you can’t just set an AI tool loose and expect it to build authentic connections,” Gyanwali said. “AI needs a human filter. We‘ve built brand guidelines into our AI tools, but we also trust our team to step in and say, ‘That doesn’t sound like us.’ It's about working with AI, not letting it take over.”\n\nTypes of Branding Tools with AI\n\n“Branding” can be a busy word — a lot goes into building and growing your company’s brand. And AI tools often only solve particular branding problems. Let’s talk about the most common branding tools you’ll come across and how AI integrates to help you get the job done.\n\nLogo and Visual Identity Creation\n\nA brand’s look is typically the first thing a potential customer sees. And, when you get it right, the memory can stick forever. You can probably picture the Nike Swoosh or McDonald’s Arches right now, can’t you?\n\nIf you want to design that kind of memory, you might want help from an AI-powered logo maker. These tools use functions similar to text generation to create logos based on your preferences, similar industry brands, and desired color schemes.\n\nNow, the Swoosh is famous because it’s the same everywhere. AI logo makers also typically offer full brand kits with fonts, color palettes, and social media assets. You can maintain a cohesive visual identity as you build your brand.\n\nWebsite and Landing Page Builders\n\nYour website is still an important part of making your first impression on a customer. And what an impression it has to be: Studies show you have 50 milliseconds to make that first impression. That’s as fast as a gearshift on a Lamborghini. How can you possibly appeal to users that quickly?\n\nAI-driven website builders can help you make that powerful first impression.\n\nThese tools can generate copy and visuals, but their real benefit is in design suggestions. You can use AI’s data repository to pick the best-performing designs, improve layouts, and optimize your user experience to nab their attention and keep them scrolling. Some tools are even adding integrated chatbots and dynamic personalization for even better engagement.\n\nPro tip: Use HubSpot’s CMS platform to build and manage your website using AI.

Download Now\n\nCopywriting and Brand Messaging\n\nMy writer’s heart needed time to get comfortable having AI perched on my shoulder, the stochastic parrot it may be. However, time and practice have shown me how these AI-powered writing assistants can, well, assist.\n\nCopywriting tools can generate headlines, product descriptions, email campaigns, SMS text, and social media posts — anywhere you need words. In particular, I’ve found value in AI as a brand messaging amplifier. It’s great at repurposing long-form content into more digestible chunks, which can help you reach more people without writing the same sentence dozens of times.\n\nBranding Research and Competitive Analysis\n\nMarketers need to crunch data to find better ideas and drive stronger results. But, I’d venture to guess many marketers did not choose their field to conduct deep statistical analyses. And, with so much data popping into existence (over 400 million terabytes of data globally every day), it’s impossible for marketers to keep pace.\n\nBranding research AI tools help you analyze competitors, track brand sentiment, and identify consumer trends to keep your brand strategy sharp. These tools review that mess of data using machine learning and natural language processing, scanning online conversations, social media mentions, and industry reports to get the good stuff.\n\nThe models then crunch that information into insights, generated in real time and with useful context. You can get ahead of market shifts and adjust your brand positioning and messaging accordingly.\n\nSocial Media and Content Creation\n\nI’ve heard, “Can you turn this into a Facebook post?” more times than I can count. While forcing brevity can elicit creativity, writing endless posts can drain any marketing team. And, as social media platforms shift their audiences and best practices, you could use help keeping pace.\n\nAI-powered social media tools can generate posts, captions, pictures, audio, and video using your brand style. It can review your content’s past performance, competitors’ content, industry trends, and audience behavior to create the strongest posts and find the right time and channel to deliver your message. Sentiment analysis can even review the emotions behind a post and recommend sentiment-driven messaging to calm an angry customer or cheer on a happy one.\n\nBrand Consistency and Guidelines\n\nYes, I prefer the Oxford comma. No, most companies I’ve worked with don’t let me keep it. Those small decisions add up to create your brand’s feel, and it should be consistent wherever your customer sees you.\n\nBrand consistency and style guidelines keep content on track, but it’s a lot to handle yourself. AI tools can centralize your brand’s elements and flag inconsistencies in your content before it hits the internet (e.g., the wrong heading font in a blog post). Your AI tool can enforce guidelines, automate content approvals, and keep your team aligned with internal brand messaging.\n\nMarketing and Ad Creative\n\nWhich message will perform the best? And how do you make it perform even better? These questions could inspire dread in any performance-focused marketer. But, with the right AI tools, answering them could actually be refreshing.\n\nAI can generate ad creatives, but it can also predict your campaign’s performance and suggest ways to optimize your messaging. A/B testing can happen in real time and at scale, with AI analyzing thousands of ad variations to get things just right.\n\nPro tip: HubSpot Marketing Hub has several AI-enhanced features to run and manage ad campaigns. Check out our free AI tool for advertising to start.\n\nBest AI Tools for Branding\n\nNow that you’ve seen the benefits, let me recommend a few AI branding tools to bring those benefits to life.\n\nHubSpot Breeze AI\n\nThe best AI tools for branding operate within your current framework. It should be simple to activate, use, and adopt AI. So, if you’re using products in the HubSpot ecosystem, it only makes sense to use an AI tool integrated with your HubSpot suite.\n\nHubSpot Breeze AI has lots of options for managing and growing your brand with AI. The writer in me looks first at content development. That’s more than just producing words; it’s understanding the context of your work in relation to your company and the larger marketplace.\n\nThe Breeze Content Agent brings that context and helps you deliver more targeted content with speed and scale. And, it sits atop your HubSpot ecosystem, so you can test, learn, and iterate quickly.\n\nGamma\n\nMarketers just can’t escape a good slide deck. But, I’m not a fan of tinkering endlessly to get that photo in the perfect spot. Between ideation, copy, and design, presentations can burn a lot of valuable work time.\n\nI’ve used Gamma for over a year now to help me solve that challenge. You can bring your notes to the platform, and Gamma will generate gorgeous presentations. The platform lets me toy with the specifics, such as the voice and tone of any generated copy or what image types get used (e.g., Common Creative licensed or AI-generated).\n\nOnce you have a presentation in hand, you can add, remove, and change content at your convenience. You can also generate documents or landing pages and publish them online directly. I’ve used the landing page feature before to spin up a new content consulting offer, and Gamma did a great job.\n\nI wish Gamma had a brand kit option like Canva does, where I could save and reuse common branding assets. But, it’s a strong and well-stocked marketing presentation-building tool at $10-20 per seat per month.\n\nNotion AI\n\nI use Notion as a document repository and information management tool, but the company’s built-in (paid) Notion AI feature has vastly improved over the past year. As projects grow in scope and scale, I end up with documents throughout my Notion database. Notion AI rounds up that information and transforms it into useful insights and actions.\n\nIf you want the most from Notion AI, plan your internal knowledge architecture intentionally. I’ve found the AI writer unremarkable. But when I need that solid quote I wrote eight months ago, Notion AI delivers. It’s great for managing brand consistency across your team and finding the best insights and ideas from your data.\n\nGet Notion AI added to your current Notion build for $10 per seat per month.\n\nSource\n\nCanva Magic Studio\n\nI’ve always liked Canva’s image creation and manipulation tools to get the right look set for my brand assets, social media graphics, and blog and website images. So, when the company debuted the Canva Magic Studio, I eagerly hopped on board.\n\nThe State of Artificial Intelligence in 2024 New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing.

You can create and manipulate images using text-based commands and create professional-looking results. It’s a powerful design tool that’s helped me shift creatively from words to visuals.\n\nYou can use Canva for free, but you won’t have access to the best AI features until you upgrade to the Pro Plan at $15 per seat per month.\n\nDesigns AI\n\nIf you’re looking for an all-in-one AI branding tool, Designs AI is a strong candidate. The free tools alone are interesting and helpful. For instance, AI Chat lets me access several LLMs to accomplish tasks.\n\nThe free plan is very limited, so I wouldn’t integrate Designs AI without paying for it. But, the paid plan lets you work with images, logos, text, audio — whatever your branding needs require.\n\nDesigns AI offers a few plan choices, but the Pro Plan (at $69 per month) is likely the best choice for AI power users.\n\nCopy.ai\n\nCopy.ai is doing something interesting in the AI branding space. The company bills its service as the Go-to-Market (GTM) AI Platform. It includes multi-platform brand-specific content but extends across the entire buying experience.\n\nCopy.ai is also leaning into workflow management and AI agenting, which I think are promising future additions to an AI-powered marketing team.\n\nI’ve tried Copy.ai’s free writing generators — and it’s good work for a generic model. Once you integrate the platform into your system, you can get more specific content better attuned to your brand.\n\nYou can try a free plan, but the $49 Starter Plan really gets you up and running. If you’re ready to lean into workflow support, go for the $249 Advanced Plan.\n\nDurable\n\nI’d first heard about Durable when I was building my consultancy’s website. I ended up using another tool, but I enjoyed Durable’s feature set — which has grown since last I looked.\n\nDurable can help you build your websites, blogs, invoicing, and brand identity on one platform. I’m typically careful when a platform promises many options, but Durable impressed me with its reach and success so far.\n\nAt $15 per seat per month, you get everything you need to build and launch your web products. If you need extra help with invoicing, social media posts, or Google PPC campaigns, upgrade to the $25 Business Plan.\n\nAutoDraw\n\nI am a whiteboard fanatic. Drawing helps me communicate branding ideas with others when I can’t find the words. But, my artistic abilities stop at stick figures. That’s why I’m so drawn to AutoDraw.\n\nAutoDraw uses AI to analyze your input (like a stick figure person), and it will select drawings most closely resembling your artwork. It’s a sketchbook that automatically adjusts my drawings so I can communicate ideas for visual design faster without continually erasing my creations. For logo brainstorming or visual identity creation, it’s a surprisingly useful tool.\n\nAutoDraw is an AI experiment and is free to use.\n\nAdobe Firefly\n\nFrom a generative AI standpoint, Adobe Firefly does much of what other design tools can do but with more advanced options available. For instance, Firefly offers a 3D generative workspace, helping you quickly design “dimensional” brand graphics, packaging, and illustrations. That’s a slick feature for retail or ecommerce brands.\n\nFirefly creations also come with licenses for commercial use. With an enterprise-level focus, Adobe tools usually reflect those kinds of business considerations. And, as part of the Adobe Suite, Firefly integrates across all Adobe products.\n\nYou can use Firefly for free, but I wouldn’t bother unless you’re willing to pay. Individual licenses start at $9.99 per month (though be sure to read your Adobe contract’s terms and conditions carefully for cancellation fees and penalties).\n\n10Web\n\nI host my company’s website on 10Web — and that hosting piece is important. I can build, launch, and manage my site from one place, with no other hosting needs required. It’s a complete feature set that makes sense for my small business needs.\n\nI like 10Web’s AI page creation tool; however, I’ve found it takes more hands-on tinkering than I sometimes want. However, once you build your site and give content to the tool, you’ll generate more brand-accurate results.\n\nYour costs will vary depending on website hosting needs, but spend in the $25-36 per month range to get smaller websites up and running.\n\nBrandmark\n\nI’m a big fan of upfront pricing models — let me make and buy a logo and tell me how much it costs. Couple it with AI’s help, and you have a strong logo creation tool. Brandmark brings AI to logos, color palettes, and typography to help create a logo that screams you with a clear and affordable pricing structure.\n\nYou enter your company name and slogan and provide a few descriptive words and color choices. From there, Brandmark does its thing — I like the polished and professional look of each logo option.\n\nYou can edit your logo using an AI chat (like talking to a designer). And when you’re ready, Brandmark can give you marketing mockups so you can see how your logo fits across your visual identity.\n\nLogos start at $25, but you can buy your logo’s commercial license and full brand kits for additional fees.\n\nBackstroke\n\nI’ve found better AI branding tools either need unique information from your company or run their operations using hyper-specific models. Backstroke deploys a specialized AI model trained on B2C ecommerce email marketing content, which leads to stronger email campaigns.\n\nI’ve gotten to see it in action through email and SMS campaigns, and it brings excellent AI horsepower to an ecommerce program. While it’s certainly not the most comprehensive tool available, I think it flourishes in its deep focus.\n\nYou’ll need to demo the product live and kick off the sales cycle for pricing. But, Backstroke has a free subject line generator and trend identification tool you can try.\n\nLooka\n\nI like the AI image generation tool Looka provides for logo design. You can design some very nice logos, and you get results that are unique to the market.\n\nLooka also offers a brand kit option: apply your logo to over 300 templates, from letterhead to social media profiles. It’s an easy way to keep your brand’s visual identity consistent across platforms and media.\n\nLooka’s pricing gets a little complicated, which is probably my biggest gripe with the platform. You can buy each logo for $20, but you don’t get full ownership unless you buy the premium logo package for $65. And your brand kit is an annual subscription that runs $96 per year.\n\nIt’s not a massive expense, but I don’t like feeling limited in how I own and use my brand assets. That said, if a human brand designer is simply too far out of your price range, Looka is a fine alternative.\n\nShopify Logo Maker\n\nAs with most people, I like when “free” actually means free. Some AI brand asset development tools will give you previews that require a subscription to edit. Not so with Shopify’s Logo Maker.\n\nThe Logo Maker does just that — making logos you can download and use anywhere. They’re optimized for Shopify shops, but you can use the image on other sites or social media. You can also generate business names, slogans, and domain names for free (essential components for a Shopify presence.)\n\nThe app is free to use. Now, you’re not getting the fanciest logos for free, but if you need to spin up a few brand assets or explore AI’s usefulness, start here.\n\nChatGPT Custom GPTs\n\nI still think people are sleeping on custom GPTs with ChatGPT, which can help you better manage your brand and create highly specific branded content. Within a custom GPT, you can write detailed instructions for your model’s context window and include PDFs of branded copy. For example, I include PDFs of my consulting company’s blog posts to help the GPT better represent my voice and tone across content types.\n\nA custom GPT is great for content generation and repurposing. You get a lot of power at your fingertips for $20 per month.\n\nBuild the Best Business Brand with AI\n\nNot every brand needs that GameCube-level memorability, but every brand needs distinctiveness and consistency. You can build and nurture such a brand using AI and human creativity to reach and win over your audiences.\n\nThe best marketing teams in 2025 won’t just automate branding work. Instead, they’ll figure out how to use AI as a strategic co-pilot while keeping people at the center — marketers and consumers alike. Begin with these tools and explore opportunities to put AI to work for you."}

It wasn’t just any party; it’s what we called the “Professor Party,” as it was to celebrate the two of us being promoted to full professor—the highest rank we could attain in academia.\n\nThe party was great—people dressed up in their favorite nerdy attire and danced to music from a live band. The party was so much fun that we’ve had it every year since, with this year marking its fourth.\n\nThis year, instead of doing the same thing we’ve done for the last three, we thought of something special. Both Koleen and I have become department chairs since our last promotion, and Koleen will be ending her term this summer. Given that the party is always outdoors, we decided to have a bonfire, burning an actual chair to mark the end of this important accomplishment.\n\nNaturally, when making the invitations, I wanted to feature the burning chair, so I asked ChatGPT (as one does) to generate an image for me of “professors having an outdoor party and burning a chair.” I had no words for what it gave me.\n\nSource: ChatGPT\n\nIn the image (pictured here), there were 10 people depicted celebrating around a burning chair—all of whom were men.\n\nChat GPT relies on data from Wikipedia, books, news articles, scientific journals, and publicly available data on the internet. This means that according to the internet, and the majority of books, news articles, scientific journals, and general information available on the web, professors are men and only men.\n\nGender Representation in Academia\n\nYou’d think in 2025 this wouldn’t happen—of course there are professors who are women. But statistically, women are still underrepresented in faculty positions at universities, especially at the higher levels.\n\nFor example, women currently represent 43 percent of full-time and tenure track professors, while men represent the other 57 percent. When you break this down by rank, women represent 50 percent of professors at the lowest (assistant) rank, 45 percent at the middle (associate) rank, and 33 percent at the highest (full professor) rank, compared to men, who have 67 percent of these top positions.\n\nWhy does this happen? There are probably a lot of reasons, for example, a lack of support for women in these positions, particularly lack of support for women who decide to have children over the course of their careers; but research suggests that the problem starts way before that, likely originating in early childhood.\n\nIndeed, research has shown that even children think of scientists as men. In an analysis of over 20,000 children who were simply asked to “draw a scientist,” researchers reported that most children draw a man, and this gets worse as children get older. More specifically, while boys consistently draw men across the lifespan, as girls get older, they become less and less likely to draw a woman (Miller et al., 2018).\n\nPerceptions of Intelligence\n\nFurther, being the type of person who is good at science—and even being the type of person who is smart—is also something girls identify with less and less as they get older. One study showed that by the time girls are 6 or 7 years of age, they are becoming less and less interested in games that are designed for “really smart” kids, and they are less likely to associate being smart with being a girl (Bian, Leslie, & Cimpian, 2017).\n\nOn top of defaulting to men when asked to draw a scientist, there is also evidence that the default for drawing any person is more likely to be male. More specifically, when children are asked to “draw a person,” kids initially go with their own gender, with girls drawing girls and boys drawing boys.\n\nBut as kids get older, this trend remains stable for boys—boys of all ages draw boys—but while younger girls draw their own gender, girls become more and more likely to draw boys as they get older (Lei et al., 2022). In other words, as children get older, they are more likely to not only default to men as scientists, but also as people.\n\nAdult Influence on Gender Perception\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nThere is evidence that kids are not just coming up with this on their own; they are most likely learning this from the adults around them. In fact, research shows that when asked to think of a person, even adults (both male and female adults) overwhelmingly default to men. In other words, when asked to describe the most typical person you can imagine, both men and women typically describe a man.\n\nParents seem to pass down this message to their children. In a very recent study, parents of 4- to 10-year-old children were shown photos of children playing on a playground and were asked to provide a caption. Parents were more likely to use gender-neutral language like “the kid is sliding” when describing boys and gender specific labels like “the girl is sliding” when describing girls (Leshin et al., 2025).\n\nThe moral of the story here is that gender bias in higher education is still alive and well, and that this bias is more evident than ever when you rely on AI, which uses the information available on the internet—from us—from which to draw. This means that relying on AI will reflect back the biases that are already evident in our culture, including gender bias, but also other biases based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and many, many more. Indeed, although the most obvious thing for me in the ChatGPT professor image was the lack of women, the second most obvious should be the lack of racial and ethnic diversity.\n\nIn order to tackle this bias for good, we need to start early. Our youngest children are the ones most likely to draw scientists and people more generally as female, and only default to male after years and years of experience with our cultural norms. That means there is hope to change this trend, but it will depend on us—parents, teachers, family, and friends—to make that change happen, both in our everyday lives and on the internet.\n\nFacebook image: Perfect Wave/Shutterstock"}

In order to get a foster license, my doctor needed to attest to my capacity to parent.\n\nI agonized about asking him.\n\nThe degree to which I present as disabled varies. If I’m not using my wheelchair, and if I’m sitting somewhere with adequate supportive cushioning, I can appear well. But, my diagnoses — dysautonomia and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome — both cause unrelenting symptoms that make sitting, standing, lifting, eating, driving, and walking difficult or impossible.\n\nMy doctor knew the reality of my disability. He had witnessed my pain and uncertainty. He had watched me curl up on his table, crying. He knew how hard it was for me to take care of myself, how much I relied on readymade meal deliveries and help from friends. I couldn’t imagine what he would say when I asked for him to support my ability to care for another person.\n\nHis office had two seating options: one metal chair with cushions and the exam table. For most appointments, I waited for him on the table, lying on my side with my purse as a pillow. Sitting upright in a chair is extremely difficult for me.\n\nThis time, I forced myself to wait in the chair. Maybe if I sat there, he would forget all the visits that had come before. The room rocked and spun, my vision faded. I pushed through.\n\nDr. Stern came in and sat down. “What brings you in today?” he asked. I talked quickly, explaining how much my partner, David, and I had thought about the decision to be foster parents. The preparations, the money we had saved for childcare, his parental leave. Dr. Stern listened carefully and asked a couple of questions.\n\nI answered the best I could but here is what I didn’t fully know yet: becoming disabled had prepared me to be a parent.\n\nBefore I became disabled 14 years ago, I pursued happiness and success with a manic and unrelenting drive. Here’s one example: While waiting to hear back from a graduate program in 2007, I got my real estate license. I hoped to earn some extra money that could help pay for school. My compulsion to excel, however, had other plans. Instead of simply squirreling away tuition, I became one of the top sellers in my large company in the first year, opened a new firm with other women in my second year, and was named one of the top agents in the country in my third year.\n\nWorking that hard requires regularly overriding other physical and emotional needs. Sleep, comfort, and pleasure are forgotten. Even my vacations ran on a Swiss watch schedule with the very best restaurants, most dynamic neighborhoods, and insider-only haunts.\n\nNo one will be surprised to hear that my body didn’t escape my wrath. I ran every morning, did yoga multiple times a week, and packed every meal with more nutrients than any person could possibly use.\n\nI became disabled on an August afternoon while on a hike in Santoroni, Greece. A detour led to heat exhaustion, which led to an electrolyte imbalance, and the combination triggered a latent genetic condition. The day before the hike, I ran and danced. The day after, I could barely get out of bed.\n\nFor two years after the hike, I looked for answers. When doctors dismissed my symptoms, I wondered if they were right. Was I just worrying too much? After my diagnosis, I spent two more years grieving and accepting my new reality. I finally admitted that I would be sick forever. But then, the way I labeled myself slowly started to change. The word ‘disability’ started coming up more — my disabled parking placard, disability student services, disability insurance payments.\n\nFor me, being sick was pure loss and suffering. But being disabled brought something new: culture. I was now part of the long line of disabled people who had come before me. I started to inhale books and essays by authors who are disabled and/or write about disability: Eli Clare, Elizabeth Barnes, Julie Rehmeyer, Toni Bernhard, Jean-Dominique Bauby, Nasim Marie Jafry, Meghan O’Rourke, Leslie Jamison, Maya Dusenbery, Laura Hillenbrand, Rhoda Olkin, Cheri Blauwet, Erin Raffety, Amy Berkowitz, Nancy Eiesland, Susan Sontag, Madelyn Detloff, Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, Alice Wong, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, Elliot Kukla.\n\nThe thoughts and lives of these thinkers shifted the way I saw my own story. I started to notice the ways that becoming disabled had changed more than just my physical capacity. The years after the hike has pried my hands from their death-grip on perfectionism. For so long, I had felt like my life was almost good enough, and I drowned in the deficiencies. But disability fundamentally shifted my perspective. Every day is difficult, and a worthy life reveals itself in our capacity to connect with each other, witness good moments, and tell the truth about our lives.\n\nThe shininess of my life before disability tricked me into thinking that with enough effort, I could shoehorn my whole existence into something ideal. My days now are slow, painful, and unpredictable. But my core belief about what a day should be has totally changed. I don’t think the goal is perfection, or even joy. I think it’s the courage to tell the truth to yourself.\n\nBecoming a parent isn’t all that different from becoming disabled. Despite our best efforts, parenting is often messy and unpredictable. Becoming a parent releases our delusion of control — or it will, if we let it.\n\nWhen I imagine what the non-disabled version of me would have been like with a newborn, I feel such sadness for her and the baby. Those early parenting days have so much uncertainty and stillness and pain. She would have railed against it all. She would have missed it.\n\nInstead, when my child came home at eight days old, I had been training, for years, to take things as they came. I was adept at days spent in bed. I was happy to wait.\n\nThank goodness I was disabled when I met my first foster child, whom we soon adopted, and then, seven years later, my second child. Because, as a result of this limited and aching body, I could actually be there.\n\nDr. Stern signed the form. “A child will be lucky to have you,” he said.\n\nHe was right.\n\nJessica Slice is the author of Unfit Parent: A Disabled Mother Challenges an Inaccessible World, which comes out tomorrow. Her articles have also appeared in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Glamour. She lives in Toronto with her family.\n\nP.S.

The testing showed the AMD RDNA 3.5 graphics on the open-source Linux driver up to around 96% the performance of Radeon Software on Windows. The most frequent question that came up from that most recent round of benchmarking was wondering how the Intel Xe2 graphics on Core Ultra Series 2 \"Lunar Lake\" now compares between Windows 11 and Linux given that both drivers have been maturing the past several months. Here's the story of the Xe2 graphics between Windows 11 and Ubuntu 25.04 while using a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition laptop.\n\nThere was a lot of interest in seeing fresh Intel Windows vs. Linux iGPU benchmarks with the inquiries raised from that recent AMD Strix Point testing using the Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 on the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6. I got my hands on a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition to carry out similar Lunar Lake tests. Today's article is just looking at the Windows 11 vs. Ubuntu 25.04 graphics performance in some cross-platform/native tests while benchmarking other Linux workloads from the X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition will be in various follow-up articles.\n\nLast year when Lunar Lake first launched, the Linux graphics driver state left a lot to be desired. But with time the Lunar Lake Linux support has improved a lot and have ran numerous follow-up benchmarks using a Core Ultra 7 256V within the ASUS Zenbook S14. Once things started maturing, the Xe2 Lunar Lake graphics on Linux have been running nice and reaffirmed by the results about to be shown in this article.\n\nWhen initially getting Linux booting on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 though, the performance was horrendous across both CPU and graphics work... This was rather surprising given the robust experience I've been having for several months now with the ASUS Zenbook with Lunar Lake. I quickly noticed the Core Ultra 7 258V within the X1 Carbon was running at 400MHz across all cores... Even under demanding workloads!\n\nIt turns out I'm not alone and after some searching there are others reporting this issue too for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13, such as on Reddit with users finding their Lunar Lake SoC getting stuck at 400MHz across all cores. I experienced this both out-of-the-box on Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora Workstation 42. The easiest solution to workaround this has been switching over to the \"performance\" ACPI Platform Profile rather than sticking to the \"balanced\" default. When switching the platform profile, the Core Ultra 7 258V within the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 was able to successfully run up to its 4.8GHz maximum turbo frequency rather than being stuck at 400MHz.\n\nWhen hitting this 400MHz bug, it's extremely clear performance-wise... Even interacting with just the GNOME desktop is painfully slow. Within the graphics benchmarks here is a look at the impact for reference. The \"- Balanced\" run is in the default balanced platform profile stuck at 400MHz while the other Ubuntu 25.04 run is in the performance profile to properly engage the Core Ultra 7 258V compared to Windows 11 Pro as shipped by Lenovo.\n\nOnce working around that 400MHz issue on the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition, the Xe2 graphics were delivering a very capable experience atop the latest upstream open-source Intel graphics driver stack and competitive to Windows 11. Both Fedora Workstation 42 and Ubuntu 25.04 as a reminder are on the Linux 6.14 kernel and Mesa 25.0 drivers for providing a very up-to-date experience.\n\nHere are benchmarks showing how Ubuntu 25.04 can compete with Windows 11 Pro on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition with the Core Ultra 7 255V. The same hardware was used throughout testing. Windows 11 Pro was tested in the Lenovo pre-installed configuration with all available updates as of testing and Ubuntu 25.04 was done from a clean install and just working around the 400MHz bug but otherwise at the defaults. Reported hardware differences (such as the CPU frequency) in the system table just come down to how the information is exposed by the interfaces on each operating system.\n\nA variety of OpenGL and Vulkan benchmarks native to both Windows and Linux were run for getting an idea how Lunar Lake Xe2 graphics are competing between Windows and Linux for Q2'2025. More Core Ultra 7 258V / X1 Carbon Gen 13 Linux benchmarks coming up on Phoronix in additional articles. With focusing just on the driver quality and not looking to get into the overhead of Proton/VKD3D/DXVK and other API translation layers, various native graphics benchmarks were used on both operating system."}

(1:33)\n\nWhich MLB teams have been the most fun to watch so far? (1:33)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nImagine you're sitting at home on a Saturday evening, and you know you need to put the phone down, but your favorite team played an afternoon game. Which MLB teams do you most want to watch? We're back for our second annual MLB Watchability Index to identify this season's must-see squads.\n\nThe original formula was years in the making, but after conducting further research this offseason, we've tweaked it just a bit. We'll grade each team in five categories, plus the potential for up to five bonus points. The maximum total score is 40 points.\n\nHere are the categories, all fitting into a general idea of: \"What makes baseball exciting?\"\n\nStar power (10-point scale): We'll use our MLB Rank top 100 list as a guideline.\n\nYoung talent (10-point scale): We love young players! This focuses on players in their first or second seasons in the majors plus potential call-ups from the minors.\n\nBaserunning (5-point scale): Speed is exciting. This includes not just stealing bases but overall team speed.\n\nDefense (5-point scale): Does the team play good defense or have extraordinary defenders capable of highlight-reel plays?\n\nMinutiae (5-point scale): Ballpark, uniforms, mascots, unintentional comedy, broadcasters, colorful characters, etc. -- fun factors that might make you want to tune in to watch this team.\n\nBonus (5-point scale): Anything else I want to reward.\n\nIn general, good teams are more fun to watch than bad teams, so while this isn't a power ranking, we should expect the best teams to rank high. Let's get to it.\n\nJump to team:\n\nAmerican League\n\nATH | BAL | BOS | CHW | CLE\n\nDET | HOU | KC | LAA | MIN\n\nNYY | SEA | TB | TEX | TOR\n\nNational League\n\nARI | ATL | CHC | CIN | COL\n\nLAD | MIA | MIL | NYM | PHI\n\nPIT | SD | SF | STL | WSH\n\nStar power: 1 | Young talent: 2 | Baserunning: 2 | Defense: 2 | Minutiae: 1\n\nBonus (2): +2 for the possibility they could chase their own single-season loss record\n\nThe White Sox won 8-1 on Opening Day, which put them over .500 for the first time since Opening Day of 2023. Look, they probably won't be as bad as last year's 121-loss season, but the early returns don't exactly look promising.\n\nThey do have a couple of rookies in the rotation who are worth watching in Sean Burke and Shane Smith, but the real pitchers to watch are top prospects Noah Schultz and Hagen Smith, who both started the season in Double-A. Maybe they get called up, but there's also little need to rush them to the majors.\n\nStar power: 1 | Young talent: 3 | Baserunning: 1.5 | Defense: 4 | Minutiae: 1\n\nBonus (2): +1 for Brenton Doyle's arm (repeat bonus from 2024), +1 for mountain views\n\nOutside of the defensive ability of Doyle in center field and Ezequiel Tovar at shortstop, there isn't much to go with here as the Rockies remain stuck in a rut of irrelevance. They even keep sticking with the same managers, with Bud Black headed for a seventh straight losing season in Colorado.\n\nRookie starter Chase Dollander, arguably the Rockies' best pitching prospect ever, just made his major league debut, so that's exciting. Good luck in Coors Field, Chase.\n\nStar power: 2 | Young talent: 3 | Baserunning: 2 | Defense: 2 | Minutiae: 1\n\nBonus (3): +3 for the possibility of more weird, inexplicable managerial decisions\n\nIf weird, inexplicable managerial decisions are your thing, a game against the Mets last week showed why you might want to check out Miami. The Mets were leading 6-5 in the sixth inning and had runners on first and third with one out when first-year Miami skipper Clayton McCullough intentionally walked Juan Soto to load the bases for Pete Alonso. OK, that was weird enough. There were 15 intentional walks last season with runners on first and third. But seven of those came with two outs, five others came in the bottom of the ninth or later in a tie game, and one came with the count already 3-0 against Aaron Judge. That leaves just two that sort of replicate this decision -- and both were issued by Blue Jays manager John Schneider (to Jesse Winker and Yordan Alvarez).\n\nHere's the kicker: Alonso is a prime candidate to hit into a double play, but McCullough then brought the infield in. Mets play-by-play man Gary Cohen, one of the best in the business, was beside himself. \"What is going on? Why? Why would you set up the double play and then not play for the double play?\" Alonso then doubled over the head of center fielder Derek Hill, who, as Cohen pointed out, was playing extremely shallow. It's going to be a long season for the Marlins.\n\nStar power: 3 | Young talent: 2 | Baserunning: 1 | Defense: 2 | Minutiae: 3\n\nBonus (3): +1 for Prince Day on June 10, +1 for Joe Ryan's four-seamer, +1 for having a Harrison, a Bailey and a Griffin on the roster -- as first names\n\nThe Twins ranked low last year, and I'll repeat what I said then: The team itself is probably better than this ranking, but there isn't a lot of glitz and glamour here. No big star (Carlos Correa's shine has dulled and Byron Buxton really never got there in the first place), no big masher, no speedster on the bases or must-see ace on the mound. The youth score will go up if Emmanuel Rodriguez and Luke Keaschall get called up -- which might be the case given the early struggles of the offense.\n\nStar power: 4 | Young talent: 2 | Baserunning: 3 | Defense: 1 | Minutiae: 3\n\nBonus (2): +1 for Paul Skenes' pitching highlights, +1 for Andrew McCutchen still getting the job done\n\nWell, we got suckered last year, when the Pirates got off to a 9-2 start -- and that was before Skenes was even called up. Quote from the 2024 edition of this story: \"This is not an overreaction to Pittsburgh's hot start. Nope. THIS IS A SCIENTIFIC SURVEY.\" We ranked the Pirates No. 10 overall. Turned out, it was most definitely an overreaction to Pittsburgh's start.\n\nLook, the Pirates are watchable every fifth or sixth day when Skenes starts, but otherwise? I'll pass, at least until Oneil Cruz learns to play center field. It doesn't help that the Pirates started the season with two PR disasters in the Roberto Clemente sign situation and missing \"Bucco Bricks\" being discovered at a recycling park. At least it's a great ballpark.\n\nStar power: 5 | Young talent: 2 | Baserunning: 1.5 | Defense: 1 | Minutiae: 3\n\nBonus (3): +1 for Ron Washington, +1 for NOT having to watch Anthony Rendon struggle again, +1 for Kenley Jansen's cutter\n\nOlney's top 10 for 2025 at every position As a new MLB season approaches, we rank the elite at every spot on the diamond. Olney's Top 10s »\n\nThe Angels are off to a nice start. Maybe they'll even be surprise contenders in a potentially weak AL West. But the team's star power is pretty much limited to Mike Trout, as young veterans such as Nolan Schanuel, Logan O'Hoppe and Zach Neto have graduated out of the \"youth\" category without becoming established stars, although Neto could develop into one after a promising sophomore campaign.\n\nThe youth score could go up if 23-year-old Kyren Paris proves to be the real deal after a strong start at the plate. I'm skeptical given the fact that he hit .167 in the minors last season, but he has been crushing it early on.\n\nStar power: 4 | Young talent: 4 | Baserunning: 2 | Defense: 2.5 | Minutiae: 1\n\nBonus (2): +1 for the spicy stadium mustard, +1 for longest World Series title drought\n\nI'm not trying to insult a team that reached the American League Championship Series last season, but the primary highlights are the great Jose Ramirez and a bullpen that was one of the best of all time. But ... bullpens. We love you, we love you not, but we don't really tune in to watch relievers.\n\nSteven Kwan is an entertaining, scrappy player who puts the ball in play and covers everything in left field. Kyle Manzardo, Brayan Rocchio and Jhonkensy \"Big Christmas\" Noel fit into the young category, but the more intriguing young players are prospects Travis Bazzana and outfielder Chase DeLauter, two guys we could see in the second half. (DeLauter will have to bounce back quickly from core muscle surgery in March.)\n\nStar power: 5 | Young talent: 1 | Baserunning: 3 | Defense: 2 | Minutiae: 2\n\nBonus (3): +1 for the Sunday cream-colored jerseys, +1 for summer days in Seattle, +1 for Bryan Woo's fastball/sinker combo\n\nAs a Mariners fan, I was ready to give up on watching them on a regular basis after they hit .162 in their first eight home games -- aside from the marine layer making it a difficult place to hit, the park seems to be in their heads at this point (the Mariners do hit OK on the road). Then, the next game, they rallied from a 5-0 deficit in the final two innings to beat the Astros on Randy Arozarena's grand slam and three runs in the bottom of the ninth. Baseball, man, it has a way of sucking you back in.\n\nAlyssa Howell/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n\nStar power: 2 | Young talent: 7 | Baserunning: 2 | Defense: 2.5 | Minutiae: 2\n\nBonus (1): +1 for pitcher Brad Lord making the Opening Day roster after working at Home Depot in the offseason\n\nThis team is a lot more interesting than it was in 2024, when Washington ranked last on the Watchability Index after starting the season with Jesse Winker in left field and Eddie Rosario in center. The Nationals were somehow 19-18 in early May before reality set in and they eventually turned to a younger, more dynamic outfield: James Wood, Jacob Young and, in September, top prospect Dylan Crews.\n\nThat trio, along with shortstop CJ Abrams and starter MacKenzie Gore, forms the core of the 2025 team. Wood looks like he's going to be a star, but Crews continues to appear overmatched at the plate, and as brilliant as Young is defensively in center field, he offers no power.\n\nStar power: 1 | Young talent: 7 | Baserunning: 4 | Defense: 2.5 | Minutiae: 1.5\n\nBonus (1.5): +1 for those glorious Devil Rays throwback jerseys, +0.5 for Yandy Diaz's biceps\n\nThe state of MLB ballparks Two MLB teams will be playing in minor league ballparks this season. Here's what it says about the sport. Jeff Passan » Inside the transformation of Steinbrenner Field »\n\nThe selling point for the Rays is the group of players just entering the majors, not just Junior Caminero's ceiling as a power hitter but a wave that includes Curtis Mead along with Shane Baz and Kameron Misner. The last two fit on our scale of players entering their first or second full seasons, even though those guys aren't all that young.\n\nNow, if and when Carson Williams and Chandler Simpson (104 steals in the minors) get called up, the Rays will instantly become a lot more intriguing. Williams could be one of the game's next star shortstops, and Simpson has the potential to be baseball's premier burner on the basepaths. But, for now this team lacks star power and some of the defensive dynamism we've seen from it in the past.\n\nStar power: 6 | Young talent: 2 | Baserunning: 1 | Defense: 4.5 | Minutiae: 2\n\nBonus (2): +1 for Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s extension, +1 for cotton candy fries (it took until 2025 for somebody to invent this?!)\n\nOne of the best things about Guerrero's extension is that Jays fans can enjoy the season without worrying about what will happen to the face of their franchise in free agency. But we're all winners here: We don't have to spend all season speculating about potential Guerrero trades.\n\nThe Jays can improve on this ranking if Anthony Santander hits 44 home runs again or Bo Bichette returns to form or Max Scherzer finds his way back into the rotation. Amazingly, Toronto got off to a nice start even though Guerrero and Santander both failed to go deep until Santander finally homered over the weekend.\n\nStar power: 2.5 | Young talent: 5 | Baserunning: 2 | Defense: 3.5 | Minutiae: 3\n\nBonus (2): +1 for not trading Nolan Arenado, +1 for Masyn Winn's arm\n\nThe Cardinals are at least interesting as they transition to a younger roster. We'll see what Winn can do in his sophomore season, how speedster Victor Scott II will fare and whether Jordan Walker will finally hit enough to match his prospect hype. Eventually, starter Quinn Mathews will be up and JJ Wetherholt, the team's first-round pick in 2024, is in Double-A, putting him in line for a possible promotion as well.\n\nThe starting pitching probably ultimately limits the team's upside, and Ivan Herrera's injury after a hot start is a bummer, so Cardinals fans will have to be patient -- which isn't really in their playbook.\n\nStar power: 4 | Young talent: 7 | Baserunning: 1.5 | Defense: 2 | Minutiae: 3\n\nFinal offseason grades for every MLB team Did your club pass or fail the offseason? Report cards for all 30 teams »\n\nBonus: +1.5 for Colt Keith, Spencer Torkelson and Dillon Dingler, all character names in Taylor Sheridan's next TV project\n\nThe Tigers have Tarik Skubal, and he's awesome to watch whenever he is on the mound. They also have an intriguing young group in Jackson Jobe, Trey Sweeney and Keith, but this doesn't necessarily register as the most exciting team around. They're certainly not flashy on defense or on the bases. Maybe Riley Greene graduates to star status this season, and the possible reemergence of former No. 1 overall picks Casey Mize and Torkelson certainly adds an intriguing subplot to the season.\n\nStar power: 7 | Young talent: 3.5 | Baserunning: 2 | Defense: 2 | Minutiae: 2\n\nBonus (3): +1 for Hunter Brown's changeup, +1 for Yordan Alvarez's presence, +1 for Jose Altuve's left-field adventure\n\nYou can't lose Alex Bregman and Kyle Tucker and expect to rank highly in watchability. Houston does still have Alvarez and Altuve, however, and Brown is quickly becoming one of my favorite pitchers. Cam Smith is one of the more intriguing rookies to watch after the Astros surprisingly promoted him to start the season, but he has struggled early so we'll see if he can avoid a demotion. Jake Meyers and Jeremy Pena are fun defenders, and when Framber Valdez has his sinker dancing in on right-handed batters he's as good as any starter in baseball.\n\nStar power: 5 | Young talent: 1.5 | Baserunning: 3 | Defense: 3 | Minutiae: 4\n\nBonus (4): +1 for all the times we'll hear Buster Posey's approach described as \"old school,\" +1 for Patrick Bailey's pitch-framing, +1 for Jung Hoo Lee's swing, +1 for Mustache May\n\nMaybe we're swayed by the Giants' hot start, but this might be the season they break out from the anonymous mediocrity of the recent past. Lee is healthy after injuring his shoulder early last season and looks terrific. Logan Webb is always a joy to watch as he moves the ball around the strike zone, and Justin Verlander is Justin Verlander, now an intriguing watch to see if he has anything left at age 42.\n\nThere isn't much on the youth side (I'm not counting Lee there since he played in Korea's highest league before coming to San Francisco), especially with top prospect Bryce Eldridge beginning the year on the IL in Double-A with a wrist injury.\n\nAndy Kuno/San Francisco Giants/Getty Images\n\nStar power: 6 | Young talent: 3 | Baserunning: 3 | Defense: 2.5 | Minutiae: 2\n\nBonus (4): +1 for Terry Francona's return, +1 for Matt McLain's return, +1 for Elly De La Cruz's surprising range at shortstop, +1 for De La Cruz's everything else\n\nA year ago, I viewed the Reds as an exciting up-and-coming team. De La Cruz and Hunter Greene lived up to their hype and graduated into stars, with Greene looking even better so far in 2025, but several of the other young players failed to completely take off.\n\nThere are also mixed messages here: Last year, the Reds ranked third in the majors in stolen bases but near the bottom in overall baserunning value. Their defensive metrics were weak in 2024 but have been strong early on in 2025.\n\nPitchers Rhett Lowder, who started the season on the IL with a forearm strain, and 2024 top pick Chase Burns, could impact the rotation in the second half, raising that youth score.\n\nStar power: 5 | Young talent: 5 | Baserunning: 2 | Defense: 3 | Minutiae: 3.5\n\nBonus (3): +1 for those glorious orange jerseys (the all-orange uniform, however, is a sartorial disaster), +1 for the B&O Warehouse, +1 for Zach Eflin's control\n\nWhat a difference a year makes. Last season, the Orioles were coming off a 101-win season, had traded for Corbin Burnes and had the hottest prospect in the game in Jackson Holliday. While they still made the playoffs, it seems fair to say the Orioles appear a lot less interesting entering 2025.\n\nIgnore Gunnar Henderson's slow start coming off the injury in spring training; he'll be fine. But the other young players haven't really taken off in a big way, including Holliday, who has a poor strikeout-to-walk ratio, raising concern about the ultimate upside of his hit tool. (He's still very young though.) Coby Mayo is struggling in Triple-A and Heston Kjerstad hasn't hit in the big leagues. Maybe Samuel Basallo will make an impact later on.\n\nThe Grayson Rodriguez injury is a bummer, but the biggest bummer is the Orioles didn't land an impact starter in the offseason.\n\nStar power: 2 | Young talent: 10 | Baserunning: 1 | Defense: 1 | Minutiae: 4\n\nBonus (4): +2 for my pal Eric Karabell dropping a Jim Thome comp on Nick Kurtz, +1 for Jacob Wilson's contact skills, +1 for Mason Miller's fastball\n\nFirst of all, it's surprisingly pleasant watching these games being played in Sacramento, at a quaint minor league park with an outfield berm for spectators. Frankly, it's a better viewing experience than the old stadium in Oakland was, with those awful dark shadows in the outfield and empty seats.\n\nMostly, however, the A's have a fun group of young players: Wilson and Lawrence Butler and Miller and Tyler Soderstrom, who is off to a huge start. Kurtz will be up soon enough to join them as well. The A's probably don't have the pitching to compete, but the kids are fascinating.\n\nStar power: 8 | Young talent: 1.5 | Baserunning: 3 | Defense: 3 | Minutiae: 4\n\nBonus (2.5): +1 for Bobby Witt Jr.'s mullet, +1 for Seth Lugo's nine-pitch repertoire, +0.5 for Jac Caglianone minor league home run highlights\n\nHow much of this score is simply just Witt? A lot of it. Put it this way: How many players in baseball history have hit for power, hit for average, stolen 30 bases a season while also being one of the fastest runners in the league and played Gold Glove defense at one of the two marquee defensive positions? It's a very short list.\n\nKansas City isn't a one-man grade, however, as Cole Ragans is one of the top starters in the game, plus games at Kauffman Stadium always remind me of George Brett, and when the Royals wear those baby-blue jerseys it's about as good as it gets.\n\nStar power: 5 | Young talent: 8 | Baserunning: 2.5 | Defense: 2 | Minutiae: 2\n\nBonus (3): +1 for dreaming on a full season from Jacob deGrom, +1 for Jack Leiter and Kumar Rocker being in the same rotation, +1 for those 1970s throwbacks\n\nThe Rangers ranked fifth a year ago coming off a World Series title but tumbled a bit in this edition. Some of the star power is in question: Marcus Semien declined last year and is really struggling to begin the season; Adolis Garcia was incredible in 2023 but not in 2024; and deGrom still has to prove he can rise to his previous level.\n\nWyatt Langford and the rookie combo of Leiter/Rocker make for an intriguing youth trio, although Langford just landed on the IL with an oblique strain. The biggest knock against watching the Rangers: Watching a game played at Globe Life Field is like watching baseball played in an airplane hangar.\n\nStar power: 8 | Young talent: 2 | Baserunning: 4 | Defense: 3 | Minutiae: 3\n\nBonus (3): +1 for Zac Gallen's goggles, +1 for Corbin Carroll's exit velocities, +1 for Ketel Marte \"underrated\" references\n\nSeveral of the Diamondbacks have graduated from youth to veteran, so they lose points in that category, dropping them in the overall rankings. Carroll remains one of the game's most exciting players, although he's not stealing bases this year and might never come close to that 54-steal season he had as a rookie. Marte is one of the game's hidden gems, and Corbin Burnes helps give the rotation some star power. Josh Naylor is a fun player and even leads Carroll in stolen bases, 4 to 1. I love watching Gallen and his ability to change speeds and Justin Martinez throwing flameballs out of the bullpen.\n\nStar power: 3 | Young talent: 8 | Baserunning: 5 | Defense: 3.5 | Minutiae: 3\n\nBonus (1.5): +1 for Jackson Chourio's hot start (but take a walk, Jackson!), +0.5 for Jesus Made hype\n\nAs always, the Brewers punch up: They're young and athletic, they scrap and claw, and they have a budding superstar in Chourio. Christian Yelich can still do some damage, and William Contreras, while off to a slow start, has emerged as the best catcher in baseball. Throw in Bernie Brewer, sausage races and a bullpen that always does the job, and this is a team that I expect will be closer to the top than everyone imagines in the NL Central. RIP, Bob Uecker.\n\nMatthew Grimes Jr./Atlanta Braves/Getty Images\n\nStar power: 9 | Young talent: 7 | Baserunning: 1 | Defense: 2.5 | Minutiae: 3\n\nBonus (3): +1 for Spencer Schwellenbach's deep repertoire, +1 for Spencer Strider's return, +1 for Michael Harris II glow-in-the-dark swag\n\nWe have to try to separate the Braves' awful start here as they should turn into a playoff contender, but other than Marcell Ozuna, nobody is hitting, which is what happened last season.\n\nFor now, they still rank high in star power. Strider returns this week after dominating in his Triple-A rehab and immediately becomes one of the must-watch starting pitchers. Not far behind is Schwellenbach, my preseason sleeper Cy Young candidate, who crushed it his first three starts and does indeed look like a Cy Young candidate.\n\nThe big question: When will they get Ronald Acuna Jr. back -- and how good will he be?\n\nStar power: 8 | Young talent: 5 | Baserunning: 2 | Defense: 3 | Minutiae: 4\n\nBonus (4): +1 for torpedo bats, +1 for Paul Goldschmidt hitting leadoff, +1 for Jazz Chisholm Jr.'s custom cleats, +1 for Aaron Judge's titanic blasts\n\nEven without Juan Soto, the Yankees move up the rankings this season -- thank you, Aaron Judge and your potential for a 60-homer season. They also have one of the most intriguing rookies of 2025 in Jasson Dominguez; after hearing about him for years, let's see what he can do. Second-year catcher Austin Wells has All-Star potential, while Ben Rice is off to a big start filling in for Giancarlo Stanton at DH. The loss of Gerrit Cole means Max Fried needs to have a big year as the new staff ace.\n\nStar power: 10 | Young talent: 2 | Baserunning: 2.5 | Defense: 2.5 | Minutiae: 5\n\nBonus (4): +1 for Gary, Keith and Ron, +1 for the whole \"how will Juan Soto do in New York with this big contract?\" thing, +1 for winning the USA Today best stadium food award, +1 for the Jose Siri experience\n\nWhat's not to like here? A lineup featuring three of the biggest names in the sport in Soto, Francisco Lindor and Pete Alonso. The best broadcast crew in the business (the other day, Keith Hernandez was not only talking about the sponsor of his Little League team as a kid, but the sponsors of the other teams). Great uniforms. An owner who wants to win. Passionate and demanding fans. And the angst that comes with not having won a World Series since 1986.\n\nStar power: 7 | Young talent: 7 | Baserunning: 3.5 | Defense: 2 | Minutiae: 5\n\nBonus (4): +1.5 for Luis Arraez's ability to almost never strike out, +1 for Jackson Merrill's new contract, +1 for the Petco Park vibe, +0.5 for Leo De Vries hype\n\nWho's on first? Inside the decline of 1B A position known for powerful sluggers has become a revolving door. We asked around MLB to see what has changed.\n\nTim Kurkjian »\n\nThe Padres have a well-balanced score: Star power in Manny Machado, Fernando Tatis Jr. and Dylan Cease (although he's off to a shaky start); Merrill single-handedly gives them a nice score in the youth category; they've been aggressive stealing bases early on (including Machado); and they clean up on things like ballpark atmosphere, broadcast crew and one of the best uniform sets in the majors. Michael King has turned into a top starter, and Yu Darvish, once he returns, is a longtime favorite.\n\nOf course, the big question is: Can they keep pace with the Dodgers? Let's put it this way: Given last year's postseason, Padres-Dodgers is the No. 1 series to watch in 2025.\n\nStar power: 4 | Young talent: 8 | Baserunning: 5 | Defense: 5 | Minutiae: 4.5\n\nBonus (2): +1 for day games at Wrigley, +1 for Shota Imanaga's 91 mph fastball/splitter combo\n\nThe Cubs ranked sixth a year ago but didn't live up to that score, missing the playoffs once again while being a little less entertaining than we predicted. This year, we're even higher on their watchability. They have one of the most intriguing groups of young players with Pete Crow-Armstrong, rookie Matt Shaw and starter Ben Brown, and their defense up the middle is electric with PCA, Dansby Swanson and Nico Hoerner.\n\nWhat they have lacked is the marquee headliner. Now, Kyle Tucker is off to a great start and is on the way to earning himself a huge contract and might even play himself into MVP consideration, but as good as he is, he has never been a guy you switch the channel to watch. Maybe that changes this season.\n\nStar power: 10 | Young talent: 3.5 | Baserunning: 3 | Defense: 2.5 | Minutiae: 5\n\nBonus (5): +1.5 for Bryce Harper's Phanatic gear, +0.5 for Matt Strahm's baseball card collection, +1 for stories John Kruk can't tell on air, +1 for Zack Wheeler's splitter, +1 for the best uniforms in the majors"}

Hey, everyone.\n\n00:01 Hey.\n\n00:01 Happy summer.\n\n00:02 It's lovely. Been working in the garden.\n\n00:04 I know. Me too.\n\n00:05 I have six bags of leaves I've piled up outside.\n\n00:09 It's only a tiny corner of my yard that I...\n\n00:12 Yeah, there's a lot of leaves.\n\n00:13 Welcome to Oregon.\n\n00:14 Okay.\n\n00:15 Let's do it.

show mailing list, go to the website, click newsletter, sign up.\n\n01:13 More and more people are writing in Brian and say they like the newsletter.\n\n01:16 That's great.\n\n01:16 Yeah, I think it's really good.\n\n01:17 I like it.\n\n01:18 I do too.\n\n01:18 I'm glad we're doing it.\n\n01:19 I wish maybe other people might learn how to write Git commit messages better.\n\n01:23 Well, honestly.\n\n01:24 I'm trying.\n\n01:25 I'm learning.\n\n01:25 but let's get going uh so i'm going to cover a something by chris beams um how to write a get commit message and oh man i probably write like a dozen get commits commit messages a day maybe you know from one to a dozen um and uh so i was interested to see how to do it better so uh the there's an xkcd at the top which is you know just gibberish the first commit message is created main loop and timing control is pretty good.\n\n01:58 And then by the end, like the most recent is like, hey, hands, just something.\n\n02:03 Here I have code, more code.\n\n02:05 Ah, my hands are typing words.\n\n02:08 And one of the things that, this isn't part of the article, but one of the things I enjoy is being able to be fun with my commit messages when I'm just doing, when I'm doing it on a branch, that I'm just doing it for local saves essentially.\n\n02:21 And then I squash it into a main branch and I really want the squashed commit message because that's the one that'll stay there to be really good.\n\n02:28 So when you want to write a good commit message, here's what you have.\n\n02:32 And there's like seven tips or seven rules, but I was intrigued by like the first one.\n\n02:37 So like, for example, at the top, there's an example of kind of a run-on commit message that you have to kind of like scroll to the right to see all of it, huge commit message, not good.\n\n02:49 And then some better ones that are shorter.\n\n02:51 So how do we get that?\n\n02:54 And having included, have like good information.\n\n02:57 Well, one of the things that I didn't really, I didn't know about, and I learned from reading this is that if you separate the subject and body with a blank line, so the top line is get will, or get and a lot of get tools recognize everything up to the first blank line as the title of your commit message.\n\n03:19 So in the example, there's an example with like just one line, the short line, and then a blank line, and then the rest of it, that your log and everything will just show that one line.\n\n03:31 And then it doesn't show the rest of it unless you should like click for details or something.\n\n03:36 Really cool.\n\n03:36 I didn't know this did this.\n\n03:37 So that's great.\n\n03:39 So separate the subject and body with a blank line.\n\n03:42 Limit subject line to 50 characters.\n\n03:45 I think that's just to keep it because you're a lot.\n\n03:48 We kind of do like the 80 character thing sometimes.\n\n03:51 And like a bunch of the characters are used for the actual like the timestamp and stuff like that.\n\n03:58 So or the hash, like the first few digits of the hash.\n\n04:01 So we want to leave some space for that.\n\n04:04 So 50 characters, subject, capitalize the subject line.\n\n04:07 Don't worry about a period because, you know, that's one of your characters.\n\n04:11 So don't worry about it.\n\n04:13 Use imperative mood in the subject line.\n\n04:15 And if you don't know or don't remember what imperative mood is, which I didn't.\n\n04:20 So I'm glad there's a discussion later.\n\n04:22 There's a discussion about all of these in the article.\n\n04:25 Wrap the body at 72 characters.\n\n04:28 That was an interesting thing that I, it just is interesting.\n\n04:33 So I use tools that wrap it automatically, but a lot of people are using tools that don't.\n\n04:38 And so to store it in approximately 72 characters.\n\n04:43 And I just think of this as keep lines short-ish and actually use new lines and don't depend on wrapping.\n\n04:50 And then the most important is number seven.\n\n04:52 I think this is the most important.\n\n04:54 Use the body to explain what and why and not how.\n\n04:59 The code changes how you did the change.\n\n05:02 So the commit message is what did you do and why did you do it?\n\n05:07 And I really kind of actually just focus on why.\n\n05:10 I don't even really do the what too much.\n\n05:13 So good information about commit messages.\n\n05:16 I also love, there's a lot of people that have talked about this before.\n\n05:19 So he references a handful of this.\n\n05:22 It says, keep this in mind.\n\n05:23 This has all been said before.\n\n05:24 And each one of these words is like this and has are all different links to different articles.\n\n05:30 It's kind of a fun way to reference other people's work.\n\n05:33 So good job.\n\n05:33 Yeah, that's really interesting.\n\n05:35 And I not too long ago learned the thing about one sentence and then a paragraph or two being extra.\n\n05:40 And I learned it from the JetBrains AI in PyCharm.\n\n05:45 Oh, really?\n\n05:46 Yeah, because it's actually really quite good at writing a commit message if you just press the AI summarize what I did.\n\n05:52 Okay.\n\n05:53 Provided that what you're doing is focused.\n\n05:55 So if what you did was run pip compile and update 20 dependencies and then you ran rough and reformatted it, never click that button.\n\n06:04 But if you legitimately did something, you know, that is like a focus thing that it can look at and go not like you remove 700 spaces in these locations.\n\n06:13 And then it comes out really good.\n\n06:14 And it does that.\n\n06:15 It'll put like one sentence and then it'll summarize in detail what it's discovered below.\n\n06:20 Yeah.\n\n06:21 Yeah.\n\n06:21 So very cool.\n\n06:22 That's it.\n\n06:22 I don't use it that much.\n\n06:23 I probably should use it more, but sometimes end up in hands just work.\n\n06:30 But usually for me, when I end up writing commit messages like that, I am frantically trying to fix something I just broke in production.\n\n06:38 And I'm like, oh, I got to put it back.\n\n06:40 Just take this.\n\n06:41 I just need you to be able to get pull on the server again and try again before it disrupts too much.\n\n06:47 You know what I mean?\n\n06:48 Yeah.\n\n06:48 Well, I just realized that there's another thing that I do frequently as well is if I commit and then push everything and then CI breaks for some reason, like because I forgot something, like I forgot to add, like I added a file and I forgot to add it and push that.\n\n07:04 I will, the second commit, I will try to have that, the message be identical to the first one so that when people are looking at, it will show up as a different commit, but then it makes it obvious that it's part of that same commit.\n\n07:18 It is intended to be together.\n\n07:20 Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n07:20 I agree with that.\n\n07:21 This looks really useful.\n\n07:22 Cool.\n\n07:22 Who knew writing a single sentence would be so interesting.\n\n07:27 Hands.\n\n07:29 All right. Let's talk about Caddy.\n\n07:33 Brian, are you familiar with Caddy?\n\n07:34 Just Caddy people?\n\n07:36 I mean, it's Caddy Shack.\n\n07:37 What is that?\n\n07:38 Yeah, but this is not that.\n\n07:39 This is Caddy, the ultimate server, ultimate web server.\n\n07:42 So if people are thinking about how do I host my web apps with Python, there are a few now that the thing that runs your Python code could theoretically also be the thing that serves, that talks to the web browsers.\n\n07:55 But typically and certainly traditionally, there's been an interesting divide there.\n\n07:59 We've got static web servers and proxies and firewall type things.\n\n08:04 That's like Nginx and others.\n\n08:06 Yeah.\n\n08:07 And then you've got the stuff that actually runs your Python code, probably scaled out to be like four of them or something in a web farm with UVicorn, Gunicorn, uWSGI, which don't use uWSGI anymore.\n\n08:21 We covered that, but, you know, Gradient, all those types of things, right?\n\n08:24 So this one I want to cover, this thing I want to cover today called Caddy is actually sort of a parallel of Nginx. So this comes to us from Frederick L. Storm. And Storm, thank you so much for sending this in. But it's something I've been tracking as well. And I've wanted to switch over, but my world is just so complicated. I have every line of Nginx, you know, you've got to put like a little configuration YAML JSON-like combo file together, I have 2,200 lines of JSON or whatever, Nginx config files.\n\n09:01 That's a problem.\n\n09:02 And I don't really want to mess with trying to move that, so it's going to stay.\n\n09:05 But if I were starting over, I believe I would be probably choosing Caddy.\n\n09:09 It's a super, super simple way to create web apps that you can run.\n\n09:15 It comes with automatic, internal, no action on your fault, your behalf, HTTPS through Let's Encrypt.\n\n09:23 So for example, you set up a website, you say my website is like michaildeploys.com or whatever, and you don't have an SSL certificate, you start it up, and as long as it's running on the server that actually that domain resolves to, it will just automatically get you a Let's Encrypt certificate and keep it up to date.\n\n09:42 Oh, wow.\n\n09:42 That's really cool, right?\n\n09:44 It has 63,000 stars on GitHub.\n\n09:47 That's pretty awesome.\n\n09:49 If you want to do development, sometimes you need to have HTTPS, and it will automatically do a local trusted certificate for you.\n\n09:57 If you want to run on localhost, it'll just do, like even localhost is over HTTPS, does clusters.\n\n10:02 It has a little test.\n\n10:04 You can test it out for yourself, like put your domain to this location or whatever and try it out.\n\n10:10 Let's see if I can find the config.\n\n10:11 The config is super, super simple.\n\n10:13 We just write a couple of lines.\n\n10:15 If you've ever worked with HTTP files from PyCharm, It looks a little tiny bit like that.\n\n10:20 But yeah, it's like real simple.\n\n10:21 You just say handle slash blog slash star and put the details out of there.\n\n10:26 That's just how that processes that.\n\n10:28 But it can reverse proxy slash API, which actually goes over to another server.\n\n10:33 And it can reverse proxy another one, which actually does like a round robin load balancing to yet another cluster of servers.\n\n10:42 Isn't that cool?\n\n10:42 Just like all that stuff so simple.\n\n10:45 Yeah, it's really cool.\n\n10:47 It still doesn't look simple to me.\n\n10:49 Well, you know, try the alternative, right?\n\n10:52 So people can check this out.\n\n10:53 I think it's really neat.\n\n10:55 The caddy files are super easy to work with here.\n\n10:58 What was I showing?\n\n10:58 I think, yeah.\n\n11:00 Anyway, there's a bunch of different examples.\n\n11:02 Some of them are simpler than others like this.\n\n11:06 No, this is cool.\n\n11:07 Yeah, but one of the other things that's cool is if you're coming from somewhere else, like I was complaining that I have all this Nginx config, you can actually just pass it an Nginx configuration file and go, I'm not ready to rewrite this in your world, Caddy.\n\n11:20 Just run this Nginx configuration, but you'd be our server for that.\n\n11:23 So you could slowly migrate over into that.\n\n11:26 Yeah.\n\n11:27 Anyway, you can even use apparently a MySQL database as a source of definition of your front end web server, which\n\n11:36 sounds kind of wild.\n\n11:37 But then again, you can write code and APIs and stuff to control it then, right?\n\n11:40 Just change the database and then you change the web server.\n\n11:43 So all pretty cool.\n\n11:44 Anyway, I think people, if they're thinking about Nginx or something like that, should maybe give this a look.\n\n11:49 I don't remember what it's getting.\n\n11:50 Oh, it's written in Go.\n\n11:51 That's what it's written in.\n\n11:52 So it's pretty high performance.\n\n11:53 It does HTTP 1, 2, and 3.\n\n11:55 So the 2 is most important, but 3 is also interesting.\n\n11:58 Anyway, 98% Go, 2% HTML.\n\n12:01 Nice.\n\n12:03 Indeed.\n\n12:04 So if you ever got stuff to host and you're not doing platform as a service, there you go.\n\n12:08 Cool.\n\n12:09 Speaking of which, let's talk about, before we move on, Let's talk about our sponsor, huh?\n\n12:15 Yeah.\n\n12:16 Yeah, so a couple weeks ago, Brian, you told people about Posit Connect.\n\n12:20 And I want to talk about it again, but for a slightly different reason.\n\n12:24 So you talked about how easy it was to use.\n\n12:26 I want to talk about how you can use it to share your data science projects and how you can do that securely with things like single sign-on and so on.\n\n12:34 So this episode is definitely brought to you by the folks at Posit.\n\n12:39 They've made a huge investment in Python, originally known as being an R shop, making RStudio and others, they've been putting maybe the majority, certainly a ton of effort, into things for Python people these days.\n\n12:50 So if the mentions of words like HIPAA, GDPR, or other privacy policies make the hair on your neck stand up, you'll know you want a trusted partner to help your data become shareable, but also follow those safety rules that we all have to live by.\n\n13:05 So Posit Connect can help.\n\n13:07 And Posit Connect lets you securely develop, deploy, and share what you build with Python.\n\n13:12 If you build it with Streamlit, Dash, Plotly, Bokeh, FastAPI, Shiny, Flask, Quarto, and other APIs.\n\n13:19 So here's how it works.\n\n13:20 You or your team set up Posit Connect on a secure server within your org or behind some VPN in the cloud amongst your cloud servers and using your existing authentication system.\n\n13:33 Then when you publish a piece of content, Posit Connect lets you set user level permissions for that content, making it visible to some users, not others.\n\n13:41 But what's even more interesting, I think here, is that you can set credentials on a per user basis.\n\n13:47 So imagine you write code that then goes talks to a database that then accesses a bunch of data.\n\n13:53 And depending on who is doing that, they can see some of the data, but not all of it are different things and so on, different team reports or whatever.\n\n13:59 so in Posit Connect you can actually per user set how they can access other things like your database or your APIs or external APIs or whatever that's pretty cool so if you work on a data science team where security matters you owe it to you and your org to check out Posit Connect do that by going to pythonbytes.fm/connect today and get a three-month trial to see if it's a good fit that's pythonbytes.fm/connect the links in your podcast player show notes and yes we all know you can just Google AI, Bing, whatever, Posit Connect, but please use our link so they know that it came from us.\n\n14:33 That way they will continue to support the show.\n\n14:35 Thanks to Posit for supporting Python Bytes.\n\n14:38 Yeah.\n\n14:39 All right, back to you.\n\n14:41 What's your third item?\n\n14:42 Well, not third item, your second item.\n\n14:44 I am going to talk about, let's see, I'm going to talk about peps.\n\n14:48 So we've got actually a couple of peps coming in.\n\n14:52 That's good because I need a PEP talk.\n\n14:54 Sorry, go ahead.\n\n14:56 So a couple of peps that just recently got accepted.\n\n15:00 So one of the peps is for packaging and one is for Python 3.14.\n\n15:08 So let's do the packaging topic first.\n\n15:12 PEP 770 is improving measurability of Python packages with software bill of materials.\n\n15:19 And that's a mouthful, but it's about SBOMs.\n\n15:22 And if you don't know about SBOMs, you probably ought to know a little bit.\n\n15:26 So this is a good thing to read.\n\n15:28 And if you do know about SBOMs, they're stressing you out, probably.\n\n15:32 So this is something that we're in the corporate world.\n\n15:36 A lot of people are trying to think about.\n\n15:39 And SBOMs, I'm probably going to massacre this definition, but generally are a way for us to, because we're using a lot of open source projects and third-party libraries.\n\n15:48 And like a Python package isn't just the Python code.\n\n15:51 It's also possibly some Fortran code in it or whatever, and some other things inside or Rust that you want to try to track all those dependencies.\n\n16:00 And the SBOM system is a way to get that right so that you can make sure that you know where all of the code's coming from.\n\n16:08 And this was, there were some different ideas about how to do this within Python.\n\n16:14 This 770 came from Seth Larson, sponsored by Brett Cannon.\n\n16:18 Really kind of a neat way to look at, Seth has looked at the different ways that we're already specifying a lot of this stuff with our packaging metadata.\n\n16:28 So how do we use that to try to fill out a lot of the SPOM fields automatically?\n\n16:34 And this is just really some great work.\n\n16:38 So I'm glad this is going in.\n\n16:41 Again, since it's part of packaging, it doesn't really attach to a release.\n\n16:47 So I'm not sure when we'll get like, I didn't look through if this is something that's already implemented or not, but it's just accepted.\n\n16:55 So, and if, even if we did do get it, we'll get it through tools and stuff.\n\n16:58 We won't get it through the Python release versions.\n\n17:02 So next one that I'm, I'm also a little confused about, but excited about is PEP 750 template strings.\n\n17:11 So we've got f-strings.\n\n17:13 These are like f-strings on steroids.\n\n17:15 The t-strings will replace the, when you do a template string, you won't say F string, you'll say T string.\n\n17:22 And so it builds, so like, for example, if you had hello name with the name in curly braces with an F string, that would fill in the name with whatever variable.\n\n17:31 But we want it to be like, just to, to just hold that thought and we'll fill in the name later, sort of a thing.\n\n17:38 And I still like, I'm just sort of getting into this.\n\n17:41 don't know really how to use these, but I'm really excited that a lot of this has been thought out.\n\n17:46 Now there's a whole bunch of authors, Jim Baker, Greedan Van Rossum, Paul Everett, three other people, Dave Peck, Lissandro Nicolau, and Caudiano, I'm sorry about massacring your name, I'm sure, but a lot of people working on this. Really well thought out also some really cool stuff about being able to combine. They thought about like with fstrings, you can do math on it or, you know, sort of like adding and concatenating and stuff like that.\n\n18:18 All that stuff's been thought out. How do we deal with like displaying them, using them, the whole shebang? This is going into Python 3.14 with 3.14. So that's just, you know,\n\n18:30 right around the corner. So really, really excited about this one.\n\n18:33 So many pi jokes are coming in that version.\n\n18:35 I think this is really interesting. I talked to Paul a few times about this, and I know he's really excited from a web developer's perspective. So think about Jinja templates, Django templates, Chameleon templates, like that kind of thing.\n\n18:49 Yeah.\n\n18:49 But with more flexibility, and they're being supported by the Python runtime itself, not a third-party library that parses and processes it separately.\n\n19:00 Well, that's what I was thinking. Like, would we need, with this in place, would you need Jinja templates, or could you just implement your stuff with this?\n\n19:07 I think you can just deal with this.\n\n19:08 I mean, I think it's somewhat inspired by components and stuff from the JavaScript libraries where you've got your JavaScript, but then there's a string in there, like some weird HTML fragment in there that's actually the template that you would use.\n\n19:24 And they're just kind of interwoven so they can have a little bit more locality of behavior with each other.\n\n19:30 I think that is a part of the motivation here, I do believe.\n\n19:34 Yeah.\n\n19:34 I'll probably have to have Paul and maybe some of the other folks on Talk Python to talk about it.\n\n19:38 Yeah, I'm sure we're going to have lots of articles about it and everything.\n\n19:42 So we will talk about it more for sure.\n\n19:45 Indeed.\n\n19:45 Awesome.\n\n19:46 Indeed.\n\n19:46 All right.\n\n19:46 Well, let's round things out with a little data science.\n\n19:51 Have we spoken about uv before?\n\n19:53 People out there, do you know UV?\n\n19:55 Have you heard of this?\n\n19:55 It's a library for managing dependencies and projects.\n\n19:59 Actually, I'm probably going to get my jacket signed by Charlie Marsh when I go to PyCon because that's how much we talk about it.\n\n20:05 No, definitely fanboy of uv.\n\n20:07 And I want to talk about a pretty new project called, you want to pronounce it as Juv, J-U-V, but I think it's J-U-V is probably the way to say it because it's based on uv.\n\n20:18 And what this is, this is a toolkit for notebooks where the virtual environments and the dependencies and such of it are managed by UV, which is pretty cool.\n\n20:29 So what can you do?\n\n20:30 Hey, by the way, this is a pretty new project, 222 stars.\n\n20:33 it's only been created six months ago, and it's not too well known, but I want to shine a light on it. You can create, manage, and run Jupyter Notebooks along with their dependencies, which is cool. You can pin the dependencies with the PEP 723 inline script metadata, which has been accepted. It must be, right? Yes, final. You can launch ephemeral sessions for multiple front ends like JupyterLab or Notebook or MB Classic, okay?\n\n21:04 And it's all powered by uv.\n\n21:05 So pretty cool.\n\n21:06 You can, as you would expect, uv tool install JUV, or you can also pipx install it.\n\n21:12 And then once you've done that, you can just say UVX JUV and it'll run.\n\n21:17 But more importantly, if you look at the different things you can do to it, you can say things like JUV init some notebook, or you can init a notebook with Python 3 and give it a name, which is cool.\n\n21:28 You can go to that notebook and you can add a dependency for pandas and numpy to it.\n\n21:34 That's not something you can normally do to notebooks, right?\n\n21:36 Or you can say I have a requirements.txt file I've created with pin versions using uv pip compile.\n\n21:44 Then I can say juv add --requirements and give it a full on requirements file.\n\n21:50 So in case you have a ton of requirements with versions and stuff, you want to manage separately.\n\n21:53 You don't have to keep typing them out.\n\n21:56 You can also do interesting things like put a time stamp for reproducibility onto your dependency so i can say jv stamp this thing and then it won't get dependencies that are released after now which is pretty cool i think all right i don't know of anything else like that like i want to just have it whatever the latest of everything i'm using is as right now that's what i want they ship something new i don't want it until i change my mind that's pretty cool\n\n22:20 but now here or now there anyway time yeah i know time zones, it'll make you want to cry.\n\n22:28 You can also say run --with, and it'll run those even if you don't want to put them in as a particular dependency. And you can lock it to create a lock file, right? All sorts of the uv types of things, but you can have it run there. You can also say run notebook with like Jupyter Notebook rather than Jupyter Lab and give it a notebook, give it a version. Like there's a lot of different things you can do. So I think I've been talking enough, but there's like quite a bit more.\n\n22:55 You can go on here.\n\n22:56 So this is a pretty comprehensive project for being six months old.\n\n23:00 Anyway, if you notebook and you like UV, consider giving JUV a look.\n\n23:06 It looks pretty cool.\n\n23:07 What else you got that's cool, Brian?\n\n23:08 That's it for our main items.\n\n23:09 I just have a couple extras and I have a feeling we've covered this, but I don't remember.\n\n23:14 So I'm going to go ahead and cover it anyway.\n\n23:16 So I'm going to take a look at the status of Python versions.\n\n23:20 So this is on the Python Developers Guide, devguide.python.org. And I just, there was within the last couple of months, there was a reformatting of this, I think. This is my memory. So the big list is at the bottom with like the full chart of all of the, all the different versions and what's left. And what we see about the full chart is most of them are end of life because it starts at 2.6, 2.7, 3.0. And so that's not really that interesting. So the new format highlights the ones you might be caring about right now. So the last few end of life's, there's a two sevens end of life, but then three, six, seven, eight are all end of life. So hopefully you're not using Python 3.8 anymore. But one of the interesting things, so there's a couple of interesting things about here. So highlighting there's, there's where we're at with, so currently three nines is still getting security updates, three, nine, 10 and 11 are, and then like right now, as of, it looks like right, the, the, it's, it's a hairy, it's hard to tell where the green and yellow start with the blue line.\n\n24:20 So there is, there's dates around, but there's a link to in here for endoflife.date.date slash Python.\n\n24:30 And so I took a look at that.\n\n24:31 And that is like very clear as to what the timeline, what we got left.\n\n24:35 So 3.13, the active support.\n\n24:40 So it was released six months ago.\n\n24:42 And it's all, so these relative times are really nice.\n\n24:45 It was released six months ago.\n\n24:47 We have a year and five months left in active support and then security updates for four more years, four years and six months.\n\n24:55 So this, the timeline is really nice.\n\n24:57 This also highlights the, so in the first graph, we just had like this difference between green and yellow.\n\n25:03 So we got bug fix and security.\n\n25:04 Doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but when you look at it with the reality of it It is 3.12, which I'm using a lot of lately.\n\n25:15 That active support ended a week ago.\n\n25:18 We're not like right on the edge.\n\n25:20 We're past it.\n\n25:21 So active support ended for 3.12.\n\n25:23 We still have security supports.\n\n25:27 So there's security problems.\n\n25:28 We still get three years of security.\n\n25:30 But we're not going to get like bug fixes and stuff.\n\n25:33 Like minor bug fixes are not going to go into 3.12.\n\n25:36 So 3.13 is where you probably ought to be.\n\n25:38 Anyway, so I like both these graphs.\n\n25:40 And these are really great graphs to pull out if you want to help convince your management chain that you can switch to a different version sort of thing.\n\n25:49 If you need that.\n\n25:49 Actually, the second one that you linked to here, the end of life, date slash Python is really good for that sort of motivation.\n\n25:57 Yeah.\n\n25:57 Look, we've got one year and six months.\n\n26:01 How do you feel about that?\n\n26:02 Maybe we should change.\n\n26:03 In the part where if you pull up 2.7, it just goes, what are you reading this for?\n\n26:08 Stop right now and go back to migrating.\n\n26:10 And then 2.8 just says never.\n\n26:13 No, I'm just making it up.\n\n26:13 Really?\n\n26:14 It should say that.\n\n26:15 No, it should say that.\n\n26:16 I've never done it.\n\n26:16 Oh, okay.\n\n26:18 It should though.\n\n26:19 Yeah, it should.\n\n26:20 Just go, stop, what are you doing?\n\n26:21 Stop.\n\n26:22 No, it has all the unsupported versions from 3.7 and older just collapsed saying like unsupported, go\n\n26:28 away.\n\n26:28 Yeah.\n\n26:29 Well, you can expand it, but it's collapsed.\n\n26:32 But having the relative time is really nice.\n\n26:35 How much time you have left?\n\n26:36 Yeah, I agree.\n\n26:36 I think that's very powerful as a mental model.\n\n26:39 Yeah.\n\n26:39 Anyway.\n\n26:40 cool cool well let's carry on with that theme because i just want to point out that 3.13.3 is out and some of the changes don't matter too much to you oh if you use the mac installer this happens like okay well i install with ev so next and then windows has things like updated ssls tests have been updated a little bit but it's got a few security fixes here which is none of them are like run for your life sort of thing but avoid unbounded buffering that sounds like you want to avoid that and so on. If you don't see the word CVE, you're probably safe, but still it's good to have it fixed. And then a bunch of changes to the library thing is getting better. And so might as well upgrade, right? Might as well upgrade to the new one. I just have to rebuild our base Docker container and uv will find the new one, download it, and then all the websites, including Python Bytes, they'll be off to the races. I think I'm most excited about the update to TCLTK. I know.\n\n27:34 All right, a couple, one more really quick.\n\n27:38 Siam Yalamarti, thank you so much for sending this in because somebody, I think in the comments mentioned, oh, just use.get-blame-ignore-revs\n\n27:48 for the Ruff format.\n\n27:51 And we were somehow complaining like, you're looking at diffs and bases, especially looking at blame.\n\n27:57 Whoever ran Ruff format, and you said, Brian, don't run format on this because you're going to own it then.\n\n28:01 What you can do is you can create this.get blame ignore revs, put probably the SHA of the commit, the hash, and then that will not show up.\n\n28:09 And you're like, okay, that's, we're not going to consider that when we compute the blame.\n\n28:14 Oh, okay.\n\n28:15 So that's, you can use, in that file, you can do a list of revisions to not part of the import.\n\n28:21 That makes sense now.\n\n28:22 Yeah, and they also pointed out that get blame has a flag, dash, dash, ignore revs file if you want to pass another one.\n\n28:29 Pass a different file.\n\n28:30 Oh, it's not automatic.\n\n28:31 Okay.\n\n28:31 Or use, yeah, I guess you got to use it with that probably.\n\n28:34 Maybe not automatically, but you can.\n\n28:36 So anyway, I am learning about this.\n\n28:39 This is all news to me.\n\n28:40 Yeah, interesting.\n\n28:41 Cool.\n\n28:42 Indeed.\n\n28:43 Thanks for sending that in.\n\n28:43 That's always appreciated.\n\n28:45 All right, so let's close this out with a joke.\n\n28:47 Brian, you've heard about BC and AD and sometimes referred to as BCE before the common era and Western calendars, you know, so we don't have negative numbers because\n\n28:58 negative is hard in calendars, apparently.\n\n29:00 I never really thought, why don't we just have like negative 400, but whatever.\n\n29:05 BCE.\n\n29:06 So I want to introduce you to a different calendar.\n\n29:11 It's such an important epoch, a different thing here.\n\n29:13 There's BGPT and AGPT.\n\n29:17 So before GPT, ChatGPT, and after ChatGPT.\n\n29:21 So before, if you're debugging a problem, the developers probably sitting there for two hours, working really hard and going, oh, okay, how's this going to work?\n\n29:29 they finally think it's working and then hands to the face six hours of debugging yeah that's before that's b gpt a gpt is chat gpt generates code in five minutes 24 hours debugging even more tears\n\n29:44 yeah what do you think yeah well so 24 hours if you're if you're being good with your body and working three only\n\n29:52 eight hour days that's three days so yeah see it saves you time this is how we save time with it.\n\n29:58 Yeah.\n\n29:58 No, I've both saved time and lost time with this so far.\n\n30:02 Yeah.\n\n30:03 I feel like that's more vibe coding than it is just like I asked GPT for a little help with a function.\n\n30:09 You know what I mean?\n\n30:09 It's like...\n\n30:10 I still haven't jumped on the vibe bandway and I haven't tried that yet.\n\n30:13 So I'll try that out.\n\n30:14 Neither have I.\n\n30:15 It's both amazing and terrifying all at the same time.\n\n30:18 But I haven't done it either.\n\n30:19 Yeah, it's like jumping off a cliff.\n\n30:20 Just do it.\n\n30:21 It'll be fun for a while.\n\n30:23 Yeah, and Ro out in the audience asks, where's the Stack Overflow step?\n\n30:27 oh yeah yeah that's got to be in there somewhere probably you're like i'm sorry i left you chat stack overflow i will not stray from you again i will go back and maybe you can help me get out of this probably not you just find the same answer generated by chat gpt over there as well\n\n30:40 well stack overflow is changing their name right they're gonna go by uh training data no\n\n30:47 training under flow okay okay you know what doesn't waste your time though what this show and us in a good way yeah so let's get out of here thanks everyone for listening thanks Brian for being here as always"}

After five years of development (or perhaps rolling around in Samsung’s R&D labs), Ballie is finally making its consumer debut this summer in the US and South Korea. What started as a tennis ball-sized concept has grown to volleyball proportions—kind of like how the promises about its capabilities have expanded with each passing year.\n\nDesigner: Samsung\n\nThe journey from concept to consumer product hasn’t been a straight line for this spherical sidekick, but Samsung seems confident they’ve finally perfected their rolling companion. In its latest evolution, Samsung just announced a partnership with Google Cloud to integrate Google’s Gemini AI into Ballie.\n\nThis means your expensive rolling robot will now have the same AI that’s already in your phone and available on your computer for free. Progress! Though to be fair, combining Google’s AI prowess with Samsung’s hardware expertise could potentially create something greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nA Smart Speaker That Chases You Around\n\nWhat truly separates Ballie from the seventeen smart speakers you’ve already scattered around your home? It moves. While your Echo Dot sits sadly collecting dust on your kitchen counter, Ballie actively pursues you throughout your living space like an eager puppy—or a particularly friendly surveillance device, depending on your perspective.\n\n“But Vincent,” you might ask, “couldn’t I just carry my phone with me instead?” Sure, but where’s the fun in that? Why use the perfectly functional device already in your pocket when you could have a volleyball-sized robot following you to the bathroom?\n\nThe robot’s multimodal AI capabilities allow it to process various forms of input simultaneously—voice, visual data from its cameras, and other audio cues. In theory, this creates a more comprehensive understanding of your needs and environment. In practice, it means Ballie will know exactly what you look like in your pajamas and precisely how many times you’ve asked it to play “Despacito” (judgment included at no extra charge).\n\nBallie’s most distinctive feature is its projection capability, which genuinely separates it from other smart home devices. This clever sphere can project interfaces onto floors, walls, and other surfaces, turning any flat area in your home into a potential display. Need to check your calendar while getting dressed? Ballie can project it onto your bedroom wall. Want everyone to see your private messages? Ballie’s got you covered there too!\n\nNothing says “cutting-edge technology” like turning your entire home into one giant, hard-to-read screen. Yet the ability to create interfaces anywhere without installing permanent displays could be genuinely useful in many scenarios. Imagine having your recipe projected onto the kitchen counter while cooking, or your workout routine displayed on the floor during exercise. The possibilities are intriguing, even if the practicality remains questionable.\n\nYour Home’s Rolling Command Center (That You Definitely Need)\n\nBeyond mobility and projection tricks, Ballie serves as yet another smart home controller in an already crowded market. The robot can manage connected devices throughout your living space—adjusting thermostats, controlling lighting, and managing entertainment systems. You know, all those things your phone, smart speakers, smartwatch, smart TV remote, and smart light switches already do, but with the added excitement of having to locate a rolling ball first.\n\nAccording to Samsung, Ballie can offer personalized health and lifestyle recommendations based on your patterns and preferences. Just what everyone wants—another device telling you to get off the couch or suggesting that maybe, just maybe, wearing sweatpants for the seventh day in a row isn’t your best fashion choice.\n\nThe robot can even provide styling recommendations, potentially using its visual recognition capabilities to judge your outfit choices with the cold, unfeeling precision only an AI can deliver. Though to be fair, if it can actually help coordinate outfits or remind you about important medications, that could be genuinely valuable for some users. But do we really need a rolling robot to tell us that navy blue and black don’t match? Your mirror has been doing that job for free for years.\n\nPet owners might find particular value in Ballie’s monitoring capabilities, which go beyond what stationary cameras can offer. When you’re away from home, this robotic companion can keep an eye on your furry friends, alerting you to unusual behavior like your cat knocking things off shelves—something you definitely couldn’t see with the seventeen security cameras you already have installed.\n\nYour pets will surely appreciate having a strange rolling object chasing them around the house while you’re gone. Or maybe they’ll destroy it within the first week. Either way, entertainment value! I’m personally looking forward to the inevitable YouTube compilation videos of cats riding Ballies across hardwood floors.\n\nThe integration with Google’s Gemini AI should theoretically make Ballie’s interactions more natural and intuitive. Rather than the stilted command-response pattern of most smart assistants, Ballie aims to provide flowing conversations that feel more like talking to a helpful companion. Whether this will work as advertised remains to be seen, but the potential is certainly there for a more satisfying user experience than we’ve had with previous generations of AI assistants. Just don’t expect it to pass the Turing test anytime soon.\n\nFrom Tennis Ball to Volleyball: A Growth Story\n\nSamsung’s journey with Ballie illustrates the challenges of bringing truly innovative consumer robotics to market—or perhaps just how long it takes to convince consumers they need another smart device. First unveiled in 2020, the robot captured imaginations but required extensive refinement before Samsung felt confident bringing it to consumers.\n\nThe version shown at CES 2024 represented a significant evolution from the original concept, with enhanced capabilities and a more refined design. This extended development period suggests Samsung is taking the product seriously rather than rushing it to market half-baked. Five years is a long time in tech development cycles—either they’re perfectionists or they kept running into walls. Literally.\n\nThe physical growth from tennis ball to volleyball size wasn’t just about aesthetics—it reflects the practical realities of packing more technology into a mobile device. A larger form factor allows for better batteries, more sophisticated sensors, and improved projection capabilities. It also means more surface area for your cat to attack and more weight to run over your toes at 3 AM when you’re stumbling to the bathroom.\n\nEngineering a device that can move reliably around a home environment while carrying all the necessary tech is no small feat. Just ask anyone who’s watched a robot vacuum repeatedly ram itself into the same table leg for twenty minutes.\n\nThe partnership with Google Cloud for Gemini AI integration shows Samsung recognizes the need for powerful AI capabilities to make Ballie truly useful—or at least to justify whatever eye-watering price tag they’ll announce closer to launch. By combining their proprietary language models with Google’s Gemini, Samsung can offer more sophisticated natural language processing than would be possible alone.\n\nThis collaboration may also help Ballie integrate more seamlessly with other Google services, creating an ecosystem so comprehensive you’ll never escape tech company surveillance again! The privacy implications alone should make for interesting conversations. “Hey Ballie, are you recording this?” “No, Vincent, I would never do that… by the way, have you considered those hemorrhoid creams you were googling yesterday?”\n\nDo You Actually Need This Rolling Robot?\n\nLet’s be honest for a moment. Ballie represents an interesting experiment in home robotics, bringing mobility to a category that has been largely stationary. Its friendly, non-threatening design delivers functionality without venturing into uncanny valley territory.\n\nBut do you need it? Probably not. Most of us have survived just fine without a rolling AI ball following us around our homes.\n\nWill you want it? Almost certainly, if you’re the type of person who reads Gear Culture articles and has a weakness for gadgets with personality. There’s an undeniable appeal to having your own little robot companion, even if its practical benefits are questionable at best. It’s basically a pet that doesn’t poop and might actually do something useful occasionally.\n\nBallie exists in the perfect sweet spot of consumer technology—not quite essential enough to be a necessity but novel enough to be irresistible to tech enthusiasts. It solves problems you didn’t know you had with solutions you didn’t know you wanted.\n\nThe ability to have your AI assistant physically follow you around might be genuinely useful in specific scenarios, or it might just be another expensive gadget that ends up collecting dust after the novelty wears off. Your mileage will vary depending on how you actually live in your home and how tolerant you are of a volleyball with cameras watching you fold laundry in your underwear.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is how well Ballie will handle the unpredictable chaos of real-world homes. Can it navigate around furniture obstacles without getting stuck? Will it survive encounters with curious pets and small children? Can it handle varied lighting conditions that might affect its projection capabilities?\n\nThe true test will come when this volleyball-sized companion faces the messy reality of actual family life rather than the perfectly staged environments of product demonstrations. I’m particularly interested in how it handles stairs. Does it just sadly gaze up at them like my robot vacuum, or will it develop a concerning tendency to throw itself down them dramatically?\n\nSamsung’s five years of development suggest they’ve been working diligently to ensure Ballie can handle these real-world challenges. The extended gestation period indicates they’re taking the product seriously and addressing potential issues before release. Whether that translates to a reliable, useful device remains to be seen, but the commitment is encouraging.\n\nThe Rolling Future\n\nWhether Ballie becomes a household staple or remains a fascinating experiment, it’s rolling us toward a future where our homes feel more responsive, more integrated, and perhaps even a little more alive. There’s something appealing about technology that can physically respond to our needs rather than just sitting passively waiting for commands.\n\nOf course, there’s also something mildly dystopian about having an AI-powered camera on wheels following you around your home, constantly watching and listening. The privacy implications alone deserve serious consideration before inviting this rolling companion into your life. Samsung and Google will need to be transparent about how data is collected, processed, and protected if they want consumers to trust Ballie with intimate access to their homes and daily routines.\n\nThis summer, we’ll finally discover if this adorable rolling robot can live up to its considerable promise or if it’s just another expensive tech toy destined for the drawer of forgotten gadgets. Either way, Ballie represents an interesting step in the evolution of home robotics—bringing movement to a category that has been largely stationary and personality to systems that have often felt mechanical.\n\nAnd if nothing else, it’ll give your cat something new to be terrified of. That alone might be worth the price of admission.\n\nJust don’t be surprised when you find yourself apologizing to a ball after accidentally kicking it. We humans have a funny way of anthropomorphizing anything with even a hint of personality. Before you know it, you’ll be naming it, talking to it when no one else is around, and feeling guilty when you leave it alone for too long. Ballie might not be the companion we need, but it might just be the weird little robot friend we secretly wanted all along."}

You chat with them on the way, knowing that your privacy isn’t exactly sacrosanct in a stranger’s car, but still comfortable enough to talk. After you get there, someone sends you a text message with a transcript of your entire conversation during the ride.\n\nAnvi Ahuja, a Lyft user in Toronto, doesn’t have to imagine. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reports that’s exactly what happened to her. When she called the number that had texted her the transcript, she got a generic “not available” recording allegedly from the Lyft service.\n\nAhuja was, understandably, upset. After calling Lyft later that night, she was told that the company was piloting a program that recorded and transcribed conversations into a centralized database. But Lyft later adjusted its messaging, telling her in a follow-up message that it was the driver who specifically recorded her—without consent—and said that it was taking “proper actions” to rectify the situation.\n\nThe shocking revelation here is not that a customer was recorded. (Indeed, I can’t remember the last time I hopped into a ride-share or taxi without a dashcam that also had a camera pointed towards the car’s interior.) While a single vehicle feels more private and intimate than a normal public place, the fact is, the driver is part of a business and it makes sense to record stuff purely for the sake of safety.\n\nBut the transcription of words, especially if it appears to be coming from a centralized service somewhere within Lyft itself, is more concerning. “These ride-sharing apps are big companies and people have a lot of sensitive conversations within cabs and they feel like they’re secure,” Ahuja told the CBC. Lyft has confirmed to both the customer and the CBC that it is running a pilot program that records and transcribes conversations inside drivers’ vehicles, but claims that those transcriptions are only “supposed to be sent to the ride-sharing company for reference if a security issue is reported.”\n\nAccording to Lyft, the system is based on the app Lyft drivers use while on the job. A Lyft representative claims that Ahuja’s experience is not related to that program, which is only running in select US markets with opt-in protocols for drivers. Exactly how the driver, or anyone else, contacted Ahuja with the transcription isn’t clear. Lyft drivers are able to communicate with customers via the app, but aren’t supposed to have access to the customer’s phone number, nor are customers supposed to have the numbers of their drivers.\n\n“We can confirm that the communication was sent via a masked number, and the driver did not have access to the rider’s personal phone number,” Lyft told the CBC. The company said it is investigating. How the person got Ahuja’s number, got the transcript of her conversation, and called with an allegedly Lyft-associated number according to the recording Ahuja heard when she called back? None of that is known.\n\nIn Canada, recording business patrons must be disclosed along with the purpose of those recordings, even in a nominally public place. It’s typically achieved with some kind of signage. Ahuja claims this did not happen. Lyft’s Canadian recording policy directs drivers to follow local regulations and says that Lyft “doesn’t have direct access to the cameras, but we will know that you have a camera in the vehicle once you complete the registration.”"}

I’ll tell you: it’s a mish-mash of tiny mechanical details that serve little-to-no purpose other than making something look suitably futuristic.

And these mechanical mounts from Red Impala and Zakarion are masterclasses in the technique! First, we have K-Drak and his steed Zeet, as built by Red Impala. You may have seen his work before – he’s a frequent fixture in our Minifigure Monday round-ups. The figure here is suitably attired, which, together with its ostrich-looking mount, really drives home the fact these guys live in the desert.\n\nAs for Zak, he made Oros and Gazelle here – and this thing seems to be made almost entirely of greebles! I’m a sucker for sand-red, so that’s what I’m drawn to here. Of course it would be a sand-based colour, being a desert mount. It also appears to draw inspiration from birds like ostriches or emus, but it’s interesting to see how two different builders can take the concept in wildly different directions!\n\nRelated"}

MCP Client\n\nMCP Serverと通信するための実装をしてあるAIアプリケーションのことで、ご自身で作成するAIアプリケーションのことだと理解すればOKです。\n\n2. MCP Server\n\nServer、と名称から物理的なサーバーにデプロイして、そこへMCP Clientがアクセスするのだな、と思ってしまいますがそうではありません。ここ、大事なポイントで誤解しやすいところなので注意しましょう。MCP Serverとは、「MCPを通じて、特定の機能を公開する軽量プログラム」 のことです。（公式ページ）\n\n原文\n\nMCP Servers: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol\n\nなんだかピンとこないと思いますので、この後詳しくご説明します。とにかく今は、MCP ServerはMCP Clientとは別のサーバーにデプロイするわけではない、ということだけ覚えておいてください。\n\nMCP Serverはただのプログラムなのであらゆることが処理できます。DBにクエリを発行したり、ファイルサーバーを検索したり、GitHubにIssueを作成したりできます。それら１つずつをメソッドとして実装し、MCPを使って外部に公開します。MCP Clientは公開されたメソッドのうち、使いたいものを呼び出して使用します。\n\n正確には別サーバーにデプロイするMCP Serverもあります。が、それはMCPの理解が進んでから考えないとMCPを理解する遠回りになります。\n\nMCP Serverが公開するメソッドのことをMCPではToolと呼びます。MCP ClientはMCP ServerがどんなToolを持っているのかを知りません。そこでToolには自身がどんな処理をするToolなのかを解説するメタ情報を付与しておきます。MCP ClientがToolの一覧をMCP Serverに問い合わせると、MCP Serverから返却されたToolの一覧情報の中に各Toolのメタ情報が含まれているので、MCP Clientは適切なToolを選択できるようになります。メタ情報の付与についてはこの後のコードサンプルを見ていただければとても簡単なことがわかります。\n\n接続方式\n\nMCP ClientとMCP Serverとの間の接続方式はSTDIOとHTTP+SSE（or Streaming）の2種類が用意されています。まずはSTDIOから理解することを強くお勧めします。というかSTDIOから理解しないとMCPへの理解の遠回りになります。STDIO方式の通信についてはこの後ご紹介します。\n\nMCPの概念図\n\n今までの説明を図にするとこんな感じです。公式のものと比べるとだいぶざっくりしていると思いますが、まずはこれで良いのです。理解が進むともうちょっと細かくなっていきます。\n\n具体例からMCPを理解する\n\n私の結論として、まずはClaude DesktopとMCPとの組み合わせからMCPを理解するのが近道です。じゃあ仕方ないのでまずはClaude Desktopをインストールしようか、とやっても良いのですが、私はClaude Desktopをインストールしませんでした。しなくても大丈夫です。Claude Desktopのダウンロードページを見たり、Webで検索した結果からするに、おそらくChatGPTのようなChatbotのデスクトップ版のようなものなのだな、と理解できます。これだけで理解としては十分です。\n\nClaude Desktop\n\nそしてClaude DesktopにMCPを拡張機能として設定することで、MCPを通じて様々な情報を得た結果をLLM(Claude)に渡したり、与えられたプロンプトによってはMCP越しに何かしらの処理を実行させることができるようになります。\n\nClaude DesktopへのMCP ServerのセットアップからMCPを理解する\n\nClaude DesktopへのMCP Serverの設定例を見てみましょう。MCP公式ページのClaude DesktopへのMCP Serverセットアップをするチュートリアルを見ると、json形式の設定ファイルに対して、次のようなセットアップを行うことが記載されています。\n\nclaude_desktop_config.json { \"mcpServers\" : { \"filesystem\" : { \"command\" : \"npx\" , \"args\" : [ \"-y\" , \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\" , \"C: \\\\ Users \\\\ username \\\\ Desktop\" , \"C: \\\\ Users \\\\ username \\\\ Downloads\" ] } } }\n\nこの例はFileSystem MCP ServerというMCP公式ページでも紹介されているMCP Serverを設定しています。このMCP Serverを設定すると、ファイルの読み書きやフォルダの作成・削除、ファイルの検索もできるようになるそうです。\n\nこの設定ファイルから重要なことがいくつかわかります。まず、commandとしてnpxが使用されています。npxはNode.jsをインストールするとついてくるnpmというツールのコマンドのシンタックスシュガーで、Node.js製のツールを自動的にダウンロードして実行するツールです。そしてargsにある@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem、これがNode.jsで作られたMCP Serverです。残りの2つのファイルパスはこのMCP Serverへ渡す引数です。\n\n正確を記すためにnpxについて長々と書きましたが、要するにClaude DesktopはNode.js製のアプリケーションを起動している、ということがわかったのです。つまりMCP ServerはMCP Clientと同じマシンの中で稼働するプログラムに過ぎないのです。\n\nここでMCP Serverの公式定義を思い出してみましょう。MCP Serverとは\n\nMCPを通じて特定の機能を公開する軽量プログラム\n\nでした。なるほど、確かにMCP Serverはただのプログラムです。そしてこの設定を見る限り、MCP Serverは同一マシン内で起動したプロセスであり、MCP Client(Claude Desktop)とMCP Serverはプロセス間でデータのやり取りをしている訳です。\n\nそしてこのようにMCP ClientとMCP Serverが同一マシン内でプロセス間通信を行う際に、それぞれの標準入出力を使用して通信をする方式をSTDIO、とMCPでは呼んでいます。逆にいうと、STDIO方式を採用した場合はMCP ClientとMCP Serverは必ず同一マシン内に別プロセスとして存在します。\n\n詳しい方はご存知だと思いますが、標準入出力を使用してプロセス間通信を行いたい場合、親プロセスからもう１つのアプリケーションを子プロセスとして起動すると標準入出力の接続が簡単にできます。なので、Claude Desktopもこれに倣ってMCP Serverを自分で子プロセスとして立ち上げる方式をとっていると思われます。\n\nこの例ではMCP ServerはNode.js製のアプリケーションとして実装されているのでnpxコマンドを使用しました。でも、コマンドを叩いてプロセスを起動しているわけですから、MCP ServerはNode.jsアプリである必要はありません。Python、.NET、Go、SDKさえあれば何でも良い訳です。\n\n実際、Webコンテンツを取得するMCP ServerであるfetchはPython製なので、npxではなくuvxコマンドを使用するように設定します。\n\nMCP Serverとは結局何なのか\n\nClaude DesktopとMCP Serverのセットアップからわかったことは、MCP Serverはただのプログラムでした。しかもMCP Client(Claude Desktop)から同一マシン内で起動する子プロセスです。\n\n結局MCP Serverとはなんでしょうか。MCP Serverが公開するメソッド（Tool）を使用するとデータを取得したり、何か処理をさせることが可能な訳ですが、これは要するにAI Agentのことだと理解すれば良いでしょう。\n\nAI Agentの明確な定義をどこかの団体がしてくれている訳ではない（と思う）のですが、要するにデータを取得したり、何か処理をしてくれる独立した「何か」です。「何か」は製品やSDKによって変わります。例えば\n\nOpenAI Agent SDKの場合、Agentはオブジェクト\n\nAzure AI Agent Serviceの場合、Agentはサービス\n\nです。\n\nそして\n\nMCP Serverの場合、Agentはプロセス\n\nと理解すれば良いことがわかります。\n\nまとめると、\n\nMCP ServerとはMCP Clientと同一マシン内で別プロセスとして稼働するAgentである\n\nとなります。 これをServerと呼ぶのはやめてほしかったですね。\n\n※追記：Serverという言葉の定義からするとMCP Serverという名前付けが間違っているわけではありません。ご質問をいただいたのでこの一文の意図についてはコメントに記載してありますが、完全に余計な一言でしたので削除します。\n\nMCP の実装の難易度はどうか\n\nさてMCPの本質はもう掴んでいます。次に気になるのはMCPの実装難易度です。これが高い場合は採用を見送ることになるでしょう。実際に実装を見てみます。\n\n超シンプルなMCP Serverを実装する\n\nMCP Clientから先に作りたい気持ちがあると思いますが、適当なMCP Serverがないのでまずは超シンプルなMCP Serverを作ります。\n\nPython 適当にMCP Server用のフォルダを作成して移動します。 uv init uv add mcp[cli] main.py from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP # Initialize FastMCP server mcp = FastMCP ( \" weather \" ) @mcp.tool () async def get_alerts ( prefecture : str ) -> str : \"\"\" Get weather alerts for a Japan prefecture. Args: prefecture: Japan prefecture name (e.g. Tokyo, Osaka) \"\"\" return \" 現在警報はありません \" @mcp.tool () async def get_forecast ( latitude : float , longitude : float ) -> str : \"\"\" Get weather forecast for a location. Args: latitude: Latitude of the location longitude: Longitude of the location \"\"\" return \" 東京は雨です \" if __name__ == \" __main__ \" : # Initialize and run the server mcp . run ( transport = ' stdio ' )\n\nget_alertsとget_forecastの２つのToolを公開するシンプルなMCP Serverです。MCP Clientから問い合わせると、どんなToolをMCP Serverが持っているのかがわかるので、MCP Clientは取得したTool群のうち、プロンプトにとって適切なものを実行することになります。\n\n一番下にtransport='stdio'となっていますが、これはMCP Clientとのデータのやり取りに標準入出力を使用することを意味しています。\n\nこのMCP Serverを uv run main.py と動かしても何も起こりません。子プロセスとして立ち上げて標準入出力を接続するMCP Clientが必要だからです。そこで、公式に用意されているテスト用のMCP Clientである@modelcontextprotocol/inspectorを使います。\n\n使い方は簡単です。ローカル環境にNode.jsが入っていれば、次のコマンドを叩くだけです。ただし、今作ったばかりのMCP Serverのルートディレクトリでコマンドを叩く必要があることに注意してください。\n\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector\n\nnpx コマンドはローカルにモジュールがなかったら一時的にモジュールをダウンロードして実行してくれます。\n\nnpxでダウンロードしたモジュールの保存先は\n\nMac: ~/.npm/_npx\n\nWindows: %LocalAppData%/npm-cache/_npx\n\nだそうです。正確には npm config get cache でキャッシュのパスを得ると良さそうです。ダウンロードしたモジュールを削除するにはこのパスの中の_npxフォルダを削除する必要があるようですが、最新のnpm@11ではnpxに対するコマンドが用意されているようなので、そちらを使用して消した方が良さそうです。\n\nInspectorを起動すると、次のようなログがコンソールに表示されるはずです。\n\n真ん中あたりに表示されたhttp://127.0.0.1:6274 をブラウザで開きます。次にcommandに uv 、Arugumentsに run main.py と入力してConnectボタンをクリックします。\n\nすると、ボタンの下にConnectedと表示されるはずです。次に画面上部のToolsをクリックします。\n\nList Toolsをクリックします。\n\nすると、先ほどMCP Serverで実装した２つのメソッドget_alertsとget_forecastが表示されます。試しにget_alertsをクリックしてみましょう。\n\nすると右側にget_alertsの説明と引数のprefectureを入力するテキストボックスが表示されます。MCP Serverで実装した通りです。試しにTokyoと入れてRun Toolをクリックしてみましょう。\n\n固定値の\"現在警報はありません\"が表示されます。\n\nこれで超シンプルなMCP Serverが問題なく実装できていることが確認できました。\n\n超シンプルなMCP Clientを実装する\n\nでは、自前のAIアプリケーションをMCP ClientとしてMCP Serverを使うようにする実装をしましょう。ただ単にMCP Serverのメソッドを叩くこともできるのですが、それだとあまり意味はありません。私たちはAIアプリケーションにMCPを組み込みたいのです。なのでやりたいことは次の流れです。\n\nユーザーからプロンプトを受け取る MCP Serverからtoolの一覧を受け取る 生成AIのモデルを使って応答生成に必要なtoolをFunction Callingで特定 MCP Serverに引数を渡して処理を実行、結果を受け取る 受け取った結果を使って生成AIで応答を生成し、返却\n\nFunction Callingとは、複数のメソッドの情報（何ができるメソッドなのか）を生成AIに渡して、処理すべきメソッドを判定させる仕組みのことです。メソッドはAIアプリ側にあるので生成AIがメソッドの実行まではしてくれません。\n\nこれらの処理を自動化する場合はSemantic KernelやLangChainなどのフレームワークを使用するか、Agent用のSDKを使用します。ここではMCPに対応しているSDKの実装例としてOpenAI Agent SDKを使用する場合ご紹介します。\n\nOpenAI Agent SDK\n\nAzure上にデプロイしたOpenAI GPT-4oを使用します。\n\nuv init uv sync uv add openai-agents\n\nまずはMCP Serverを使用しないで単純にGPT-4oと通信するだけの実装をします。\n\nmain.py from openai import AsyncAzureOpenAI from openai.types.responses import ResponseTextDeltaEvent from agents import set_default_openai_client , Agent , Runner import asyncio api_version = \" 2025-03-01-preview \" endpoint = \" YOUR_OPENAI_ENDPOINT \" apikey = \" YOUR_OPENAI_APIKEY \" async def main (): openai_client = AsyncAzureOpenAI ( api_key = apikey , api_version = api_version , azure_endpoint = endpoint , ) # Set the default OpenAI client for the Agents SDK # set trace off because of recomendation from OpenAI set_default_openai_client ( openai_client , use_for_tracing = False ) try : agent = Agent ( name = \" Assistant \" , instructions = \" You are a helpful assistant. \" , model = \" gpt-4o \" ) result = Runner . run_streamed ( agent , \" 東京に行きます。天気予報は？ \" ) async for event in result . stream_events (): if event . type == \" raw_response_event \" and isinstance ( event . data , ResponseTextDeltaEvent ): print ( event . data . delta , end = \"\" , flush = True ) finally : await openai_client . close () if __name__ == \" __main__ \" : asyncio . run ( main ())\n\n結果はこんな感じです。\n\nでは、このコードを次のように修正して、先ほど作った超シンプルMCP Serverを使用してみましょう。\n\nmain.py from openai import AsyncAzureOpenAI from openai.types.responses import ResponseTextDeltaEvent from agents import set_default_openai_client , Agent , Runner import asyncio + from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio api_version = \" 2025-03-01-preview \" endpoint = \" YOUR_OPENAI_ENDPOINT \" apikey = \" YOUR_OPENAI_APIKEY \" async def main (): openai_client = AsyncAzureOpenAI ( api_key = apikey , api_version = api_version , azure_endpoint = endpoint , ) #

Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nBest Prices Today: Kingston DataTraveler Max 10Gbps USB stick\n\nRetailer Price Kingston $37.99 View Deal Product Price\n\nIncreasingly, vendors are upping the ante when it comes to the performance of their USB sticks. It’s now commonplace to see 10Gbps, as employed by the Kingston’s DataTraveler Max reviewed here.\n\nI have no doubt that a USB4 thumb drive will soon make an appearance. Okay, maybe not soon, but they will arrive at some point. For now, I can make do with 1 gigabyte-per-second transfers.\n\nRead on to learn more, then see our roundup of the best external drives for comparison.\n\nWhat are the Kingston DataTraveler Max’s features?\n\nThe DataTraveler Max is a 10Gbps (USB 3.2) USB stick/SSD sporting a Type-A connector. It’s around 3.63 inches long, 0.85 inches wide, and a mere 0.32 inches thick. Weight is hardly worth mentioning at 0.5 ounces.\n\nThe Kingston DataTraveler Max with the Type-A USB connector exposed.\n\nThe 1TB DataTraveler Max that Kingston sent me was black with a maroon sliding cover that clicks into place. As the cover is only a clamshell, when you slide it forward to cover the Type-A connector, it leaves the bottom half of said connector still exposed. Basically, don’t drop it into water.\n\nAlso, the light weight and hard material makes the drive feel a bit flimsy, though it held up well in my hands-on evaluation. Beyond that, I quite like the design.\n\nBecause you push on the actual drive portion for insertion, there’s no frustration of a lever or switch slipping.\n\nI also got a kick out of holding the drive between my fingers and my thumb, and using my thumb to slide the cover back and forth. Much like you’d flick a Bic. (Look it up.)\n\nHow much does the Kingston DataTraveler Max cost?\n\nThough the DataTraveler Max retails at $38 for the 256GB capacity, $68 for the 512GB, and $120 for the 1TB, I found it on sale on Amazon for $32.95, $56.39, and $92.43, respectively. At one point, the 1TB version was as low as $80 on Amazon — that’s pretty darn affordable for a 1TB external SSD, USB stick or no.\n\nThe Kingston DataTraveler Max with the Type-A USB connector retracted.\n\nBut as always, look around. There are competitors such as the significantly newer and faster-with-large-files PNY Pro Elite V3 that are priced even lower than the DataTraveler Max’s sale prices.\n\nBecause of that, I’m guessing that Kingston’s sale prices on this item won’t disappear anytime soon. (Don’t hold me to that.)\n\nI got a kick out of holding the drive between my fingers and my thumb, and using my thumb to slide the cover back and forth. Much like you’d flick a Bic.\n\nHow fast is the Kingston DataTraveler Max?\n\nFor light duty, the Kingston DataTraveler Max compares nicely to other 10Gbps USB drives. But it’s absolutely not the drive for long writes. While it placed 63rd among all drives and fourth among eight thumb drives in overall performance, it finished dead last in our 450GB write (69th place). It wasn’t close either — almost 9 minutes behind the next worst performer. Ahem.\n\nIn CrystalDiskMark 8 the DataTraveler Max performed well below par with the 64GiB data set we normally employ while writing. Much like the Teamgroup X1 Max. Maybe stop naming your USB sticks “Max”? Just saying, folks.\n\nWith CrystalDiskMark 8 using a much smaller 8GiB data set, the DataTraveler Max performed more on par with its peers. I’ve included both results here, but the 64GiB results are the official ones. Note that AS SSD 2.0 showed the drive with very good numbers using its 10GB data set.\n\nIn CrystalDiskMark 8 the DataTraveler Max perfromed well below par with the 64GiB data set while writing. With the 8GiB data set it performed more on par with its peers. With the lighter data set it’s largely competitive.\n\nRandom performance was much the same story — good, but not on pace with the most excellent SK Hynix Tube T31.\n\nThe DataTraveler Max’s random performance was much the same story, good, but not on pace with the most excellent SK Hynix tube T31.\n\nThe DataTraveler Max turned in decent, if not top-tier 48GB transfer times.\n\nThe DataTraveler Max turned in decent, if not top-tier 48GB transfer times.\n\nWhere the DataTraveler Max really fell apart was in our 450GB write test. Not to pile on, but again, it finished dead last in this test, at 69th place, almost 9 minutes behind the next worst performer.\n\nWhere are theDataTraveler Max really fell apart was in our 450GB write test.\n\nBelow you can see where the issue with the Kingston DataTraveler Max’s long writes falls. It slows to around 80MBps (Yowser!) once it runs out of secondary cache. That almost surely means that the NAND is QLC. I just complained about the PNY Pro Elite V3’s 1,800 second write time, so you can guess how I feel about this one.\n\nNote that the slowdown occurs at around the 12 percent mark, or after around 50- to 55GB.\n\nNote that the DataTraveler Max did recover well after this long write. Subsequent 48GB writes proceeded at their normal (for the DataTraveler Max) 700MBps pace. Hence, with smaller data sets you should get good performance even as the drive fills.\n\nShould you buy the Kingston DataTraveler Max?\n\nGiven the right price, the Kingston DataTraveler Max easily meets the needs of most users — I don’t hesitate recommending it for relatively light loads. I also love the way the cover flicks and clicks in place. However, if you’re looking for something that’s fast with really large files, look to anything else.\n\nHow we test"}

One name emerging from the rumour mill… [+3268 chars]", "title": "Liverpool ‘Definitely’ Interested in £60m Forward Ahead of Potential Summer Move – Journalist", "fullContent": "Liverpool’s Striker Search: Reading Between the Lines on Hugo Ekitike Rumours\n\nWith Arne Slot on the brink of Premier League glory in his debut season at Liverpool, attention is already beginning to turn towards the summer transfer window. One name emerging from the rumour mill is Hugo Ekitike, the 21-year-old French striker currently at Eintracht Frankfurt, who could be signed in a deal worth around £60million.\n\nDavid Lynch, speaking on Anfield Index with Dave Davis, added credibility to the whispers surrounding Ekitike and Liverpool, stating, “There’s definitely something in it. His representatives are definitely driving this, but Liverpool will be interested in a player of his quality and profile.”\n\nThis interest, while intriguing, feels layered. It’s not a case of Liverpool making formal moves just yet. As Lynch cautiously added, “He absolutely is on the radar this summer, there’s no question about that.” Yet, this radar is crowded — and Ekitike’s camp seem eager to amplify the signal.\n\nAgent-Led Noise or Genuine Interest?\n\nIn classic Liverpool fashion under Michael Edwards and now Richard Hughes, big moves are rarely telegraphed. The club operates in silence until signatures are inked. This makes the noise around Ekitike feel slightly off-brand.\n\n“My only thing about the agents, is that when they’re pushing it this hard it is often because Liverpool aren’t pushing too hard and they’re trying to drum up interest from other clubs,” Lynch explained, capturing a common pattern in transfer speculation.\n\nAnd he’s right. When Liverpool truly want a player, we usually hear about it after the deal is practically done. Think Gakpo. Think Mac Allister. So when representatives start pushing narratives into the public domain, it can often suggest the opposite — that Liverpool might not be at the front of the queue.\n\nAs Lynch put it, “Liverpool like to do their business quietly and keep it under wraps, and that’s not what is happening with Ekitike.”\n\nDoes Ekitike Fit Slot’s System?\n\nStill, let’s not dismiss the footballing logic. Slot’s system will require dynamic forward options, especially with question marks around the futures of Mohamed Salah and Darwin Núñez. Ekitike, with his tall frame, quick feet and eye for goal, does offer something slightly different.\n\nHis season hasn’t been outstanding statistically, but Liverpool have long valued potential over polished output. Think Diogo Jota from Wolves, or even a younger Luis Díaz. There’s development in Ekitike — and that’s what Slot could mould.\n\nLynch gave an important caveat: “Liverpool have definitely looked at him, but we will have to wait until the summer to really see if they want to pursue it.” This suggests due diligence is being done, but a concrete move is far from guaranteed.\n\nStrategic Patience or Summer Smoke?\n\nLiverpool’s success in recent years hasn’t been just about signing the right players, but doing it at the right time and under the radar. The Ekitike rumours, while exciting for fans eager for a glimpse into the club’s future, should be treated with a healthy dose of scepticism.\n\nArne Slot, assuming he seals the Premier League crown as expected, will likely be given the tools to evolve this squad. Whether Ekitike is one of them remains to be seen.\n\nWhat’s clear, however, is that Liverpool are entering a new era — one with a more continental approach, a younger manager, and likely, younger signings. Ekitike may or may not be the answer. But the question being asked — about what Liverpool need next — is the right one."}

But wh… [+3470 chars]", "title": "David Lynch Heaps Praise on ‘World-Class’ Liverpool Star After Dramatic West Ham United Win", "fullContent": "Alisson Becker Proves His Class Again as Liverpool Close in on Title\n\nAs Liverpool edged closer to a historic Premier League title under Arne Slot, their narrow 2-1 victory over West Ham United served as yet another showcase of elite-level quality and composure. But while Virgil van Dijk grabbed the headlines with a dramatic late winner, and Andy Robertson was unfortunate to score an own-goal that briefly levelled the match, it was Alisson Becker who truly underlined the gulf in class that still exists between him and virtually every other goalkeeper in the league.\n\nSpeaking to Dave Davis for Anfield Index, respected journalist David Lynch delivered a pointed analysis of Alisson’s performance, noting that “we talk about him quite a lot and about how good Caoimhin Kelleher is as a backup option, but over the past two games we have seen just how much of a step there is still between them. He’s world-class.”\n\nThat step is not just one of ability, but of reliability. It’s the subtle psychology Alisson imposes on opposition attackers, the quiet command that makes even high-pressure moments feel like a formality for the Brazilian.\n\nMatch Turned on Alisson’s Shoulders\n\nBefore Van Dijk’s header secured all three points and took Liverpool to within two wins of the title, it was Alisson’s interventions that kept the dream alive. In a first half where West Ham carved out several promising openings, it was Alisson who stood tallest—literally and figuratively.\n\n“He gets out quick and makes himself big when Bowen is through on goal, then he tips Kudus’ chip onto the bar and then he shows how good he is with the ball at his feet,” Lynch said, painting the picture of a man not just in form, but in full command of his craft.\n\nMoments like these are why players and fans alike hold Alisson in such regard. It is not just the saves—it is the assurance, the calm under pressure, the economy of movement. He is Liverpool’s foundation stone, and in matches like these, his value can’t be overstated.\n\nSlot’s Reds Keep Nerve as Title Beckons\n\nArne Slot’s Liverpool have shown a resilience this season that should excite any supporter. Even after Robertson’s own goal, which could have easily destabilised a less mature side, there was no panic—only resolve.\n\nLiverpool found their way back into control, culminating in a towering header from Van Dijk. But even then, it was Alisson’s earlier work that gave them the platform. As Lynch summed it up: “Liverpool don’t have a chance to win that game if it wasn’t for him keeping them out at the other end.”\n\nSlot’s tactical setup, which leans heavily on confident distribution from the back and disciplined pressing in midfield, thrives when underpinned by a goalkeeper like Alisson. His composure in possession is not just useful—it’s essential. It allows the team to reset, to build again. In tight matches where margins are razor-thin, this is the kind of asset that separates champions from contenders.\n\nLegacy of a Modern Great\n\nThere’s a temptation to take Alisson for granted. After all, how often do you see a goalkeeper who routinely makes one-on-one saves look routine? But as David Lynch so aptly put it: “It took one of our own players to score an own-goal for him to eventually concede and he was quite rightly awarded Man of the Match.”\n\nAlisson isn’t just Liverpool’s best goalkeeper since the glory days of Clemence and Grobbelaar—he is arguably one of the best to ever wear the shirt. And if this title charge ends with silverware in May, there will be no question that his fingerprints—gloved and all—are all over it.\n\nIn the words of Lynch: “Every time the opposition go through on goal, you always favour Alisson, and that isn’t normal.” Perhaps that’s the highest compliment of all."}

As reported by 90min, the Reds—alongside Arsenal, Manchester United, and Newcastle—are monitoring Hugo Ekitike, the 22-year-old forward lighting up the Bundesliga with Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nThe problem? He’s no longer the affordable option many clubs had hoped for. Ekitike’s emergence as one of Europe’s most promising centre-forwards has prompted Frankfurt to slap a record-breaking price tag on him. According to Sport Bild, the German club are seeking €100 million (£86.5m)—a fee that would eclipse the €95m they received from Paris Saint-Germain for Randal Kolo Muani last year.\n\nFrankfurt’s Financial Strength Drives Price\n\nFrankfurt aren’t in any rush. They’re not a club built on panic sales. The 2022 Europa League winners are on course for their best Bundesliga finish in three decades, and with Champions League qualification nearly in hand, they’re financially comfortable. That stability gives them the leverage to drive a hard bargain—and they’re doing exactly that.\n\n“Ekitike has caught the eye of Europe’s elite… Yet, if Frankfurt are even willing to lose their talisman this summer, they are hoping to extract €100m (£86.5m),” 90min reports.\n\nFor Liverpool, that’s a steep investment in a player with potential but not yet proven over multiple seasons in a top-five league. The Reds have been pragmatic in their recruitment strategy and may hesitate at that valuation, especially with other areas of the squad also needing reinforcement under Arne Slot.\n\nStandout Performances and Growing Hype\n\nEkitike’s goal in Frankfurt’s recent 1-1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League quarter-final first leg only added to his growing reputation. Four Premier League clubs sent scouts to watch him—and they won’t have left disappointed.\n\nThe Frenchman netted his 21st goal of the season last weekend against Heidenheim, continuing the kind of form that’s turned heads across Europe. Technically gifted and composed in the box, Ekitike is proving he can deliver against strong opposition.\n\nLiverpool’s Calculated Approach\n\nFor Liverpool, this isn’t just about chasing a shiny new signing. It’s about identifying the right fit at the right price. With an £86.5m valuation, Ekitike becomes a risk—a calculated one, perhaps, but a risk nonetheless.\n\nAnd with Frankfurt’s recent sales of Omar Marmoush and Kolo Muani bringing in hefty fees, the German side have every reason to stand firm. As it stands, Liverpool and their rivals will need to decide just how far they’re willing to stretch to secure one of Europe’s rising stars.\n\nStatistical Analysis by EPL Index\n\nAttacking Threat Shines Through\n\nWhen analysing Hugo Ekitike’s performance data and stats, one thing is immediately clear—this is a forward with high-end attacking output. According to data from Fbref, visualised via FBCharts, Ekitike ranks in the 99th percentile for xG + xAG (expected goals and assists combined) among forwards, underlining his ability to both finish and create. His non-penalty xG (93rd percentile) and assist numbers (94th percentile) support the profile of a well-rounded attacker, not merely a poacher.\n\nEkitike is a consistent source of threat in the final third, with shot-creating actions (94th percentile) showing his involvement in build-up and end-product phases. His productivity is a key part of Frankfurt’s sharp edge in front of goal.\n\nPossession Involvement Signals Modern Forward Profile\n\nFor a striker, Ekitike’s possession-based stats stand out. He ranks in the 97th percentile for successful take-ons, a sign of confidence and technical quality when carrying the ball. His progressive carries (92nd percentile) and progressive passes received (90th percentile) further point to a player capable of breaking lines and stretching defensive shapes.\n\nEven his touches (85th percentile) and progressive passes (57th percentile) suggest a forward willing to drop deeper, link play, and be involved in more than just final-third moments. The data here paints a picture of a modern, mobile forward with versatility in his movement and use of space.\n\nDefensive Contributions Surpass Expectations\n\nOften overlooked in strikers, Ekitike’s defensive output is notable. He scores solidly in aerial duels (73rd percentile) and dribblers tackled (77th percentile), while his tackles and interceptions (75th percentile) are higher than many would expect from a forward. He offers pressing utility—a non-negotiable in modern top-flight systems."}

Liverpool’s Summer No.9 Dilemma Unfolds\n\n\n\nSlot’s First Real Squad on Horizon\n\nThis summer marks a crucial pivot for Liverpool under Arne Slot. After inheriting Jürgen Klopp’s core squad and navigating a supposed transitional season that could now astonishingly deliver the Premier League title, Slot finally gets the chance to shape a team in his own image. Anfield Watch confirms: “that’s one of the main goals this summer” as the Reds look to “overhaul their attacking options.”\n\nLast summer brought only Federico Chiesa—a signing Slot has “barely used”—leaving the Dutchman working with a unit not of his making. But the 2025 window offers a clean slate, and with a new No.9 firmly on the agenda, Liverpool appear to be casting their net wide.\n\nEkitike: The Complete Prospect?\n\n“Ekitike is one of the most promising forwards in Europe right now, after all. He’s still only 22 but looks near-enough complete – exactly what Liverpool are looking for right now.”\n\nThat glowing assessment from Anfield Watch outlines why Hugo Ekitike has surged into prominence. Once valued around £60m, the Frenchman offered an ideal profile: dynamic, technical, and far cheaper than Newcastle’s Alexander Isak.\n\nHowever, as interest in Ekitike grows, so does his price tag.\n\nIsak Remains the Benchmark\n\nNewcastle’s Isak is widely considered Liverpool’s top target, but a “near £150m” valuation creates serious barriers. That’s why “Liverpool [had] every single reason to push for Ekitike as an alternative.”\n\nBut with Bild reporting Frankfurt now want “at least £70m”, the chasm between Isak and Ekitike is narrowing. It’s no longer about finding a bargain—it’s about making the right strategic call.\n\nFrankfurt Hold the Cards\n\nFrankfurt know exactly what they have. A 22-year-old forward seen as “the alternative to Isak” and younger than the Swede, Ekitike’s valuation is ballooning accordingly. According to Bild, Frankfurt “internally believe Ekitike could be their first €100m transfer.”\n\nIf that holds, Liverpool may find themselves back at square one—debating whether to go all in on Isak despite the cost, or gamble on a rapidly rising Ekitike market.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\n\n\nThis is the kind of transfer talk that gets pulses racing. Liverpool are on the brink of a Premier League title and now, for the first time in years, they’re heading into a summer where a new manager gets to handpick his frontman. It’s exciting—and the thought of Ekitike leading the line under Arne Slot is mouth-watering.\n\nAt 22, Ekitike is the modern forward prototype—fast, skillful, and clinical. If £60m was once the fee, that felt like a bargain for someone of his potential. But as Bild suggests the price may climb to £70m or beyond, fans might rightly ask: is he worth the risk if he’s no longer the value option?\n\nThen there’s Isak. £150m is absurd, but if Ekitike keeps creeping closer to nine figures, suddenly the safer, Premier League-proven option doesn’t look quite so far-fetched.\n\nWhat we do know is this: Arne Slot needs his man, and Liverpool can’t afford to miss again like they did last summer. Whoever they pick, the pressure is on to deliver a striker worthy of leading a title-challenging squad into a new era.\n\nLet the striker saga begin."}

Replacing Jürgen Klopp, a managerial colossus who delivered a long-awaited Premier League title and redefined an era, was never going to be easy. Yet, within months, Slot has not only stabilised the Reds but carved out his own place in Liverpool’s rich footballing tapestry.\n\nSlot has guided Liverpool to 36 wins from his first 50 matches, a club record that surpasses the achievements of revered figures like Joe Fagan, Kenny Dalglish, and Klopp himself, who managed 26 in his first 50 games. In doing so, Slot has brought an immediate effectiveness and adaptability that few anticipated.\n\nHis tactical acumen has revitalised the squad. Which was highlighted by Liverpool.com “His tactical approach has brought a fresh dynamic to the squad, and it’s paying off in a major way.” This fresh outlook is exactly what Liverpool needed as they looked to evolve post-Klopp, and the results have been instant.\n\nSetting a Relentless Pace\n\nThe 46-year-old Dutchman is not only delivering wins but style and substance. With Liverpool primed to challenge for their second Premier League title in five years, Slot’s fingerprints are all over this renaissance. His ability to adapt, think quickly on his feet, and instil belief into a new-look side has made a real difference.\n\n“Many predicted he would struggle,” yet here we are, with Slot’s Liverpool pushing boundaries that seemed out of reach just a year ago. His “winning formula” is more than cliché—it’s been tangible and ruthless in execution.\n\nHistoric Comparisons and Modern Dominance\n\nLiverpool’s managerial lineage is glittering—Dalglish, Fagan, Shankly, Paisley, Klopp. Each carved their names through silverware and spirit. Fagan, notably, remains the only English manager to win three major trophies in one season. But Slot is earning his right to be mentioned in the same breath.\n\n“Slot’s achievements in his first season suggest he may have already unlocked a winning formula for the Reds.” It’s not just about numbers—it’s the tone he’s set. The players look sharper, the fans are louder, and the belief has returned to Anfield.\n\nMomentum With Purpose\n\n“Liverpool fans have been quick to praise the new head coach’s approach”—and rightly so. There’s a visible shift. This isn’t a manager trying to copy what came before. Slot is setting his own identity. It’s bold, energetic, and tactically astute.\n\nLiverpool.com says: “Arne Slot’s early achievements at Liverpool aren’t just impressive—they are a statement… He’s not just filling big shoes—he is starting to craft his own legacy.” Few would argue otherwise. The foundation laid in this first season could signal the start of another historic chapter.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nHonestly, it feels like we’ve been given a glimpse of the future—and it looks bright. Slot came in under huge pressure, with some of us unsure if he was the right man. But breaking a club record already? That’s more than just encouraging—it’s electric.\n\nThis isn’t just about tactics. It’s about energy. You can see it in the way the lads press, in how we turn defence into attack with pace and intelligence. And above all, you can see it in the smiles. The team looks happy, hungry, and ambitious again.\n\nWe loved Klopp, and we always will. But Slot is not trying to be Klopp 2.0. He’s brought his own methods, and they’re working. Beating a record set by legends? That sends a message—not just to fans but to rivals. Liverpool are not in transition; we’re in contention.\n\nIf this is what the first season looks like, we’re buzzing to see what’s next. We might just be watching the birth of something special again at Anfield."}

The Japan international, who has registered eight goals and three assists this season, is expected to be at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war in the coming months.\n\nMitoma, 27, remains under contract at the Amex until 2027, placing Brighton in a strong negotiating position. But despite this, there is a growing feeling the south coast club may be willing to cash in—especially if they fail to secure European football. Currently sitting ninth in the Premier League, Brighton risk falling out of contention for continental competition, and that could force a rethink on their most valuable assets.\n\n“Brighton will consider big Kaoru Mitoma sale,” the article states. “Sources have told TEAMtalk that Brighton will demand £80m for the dynamic forward.”\n\nLiverpool’s Summer Ambition\n\nWhile the figure may prove a stumbling block, Liverpool have shown long-standing admiration for Mitoma’s directness, intelligence in wide areas, and technical quality—attributes that align well with Arne Slot’s high-tempo blueprint.\n\nTEAMtalk also note that Liverpool have held long-term interest in the winger, and while Al-Nassr from Saudi Arabia remain interested after submitting £54m and £61m bids in January, the pull of Anfield—and potentially Champions League football—could yet prove decisive.\n\n“A big summer is on the horizon for Liverpool and they do have money to spend as they look to back Arne Slot with reinforcements all over the pitch.”\n\nSquad Dynamics at Anfield\n\nMitoma operates primarily from the left flank, where he would compete with Luis Díaz and Cody Gakpo. Díaz’s future remains uncertain amid growing links with Barcelona and other top European sides, raising the possibility that Liverpool are positioning themselves for a wider reshuffle in attack.\n\nMo Salah’s new contract locks down the right-hand side, but the opposite wing remains more fluid. Mitoma’s arrival would offer depth, pace, and direct threat—key in breaking down low blocks, a regular challenge for Liverpool in domestic fixtures.\n\nWages Could Complicate Pursuit\n\nOne major obstacle is likely to be financial. While Liverpool may match Brighton’s valuation if required, Al-Nassr and other Saudi Pro League clubs can outmuscle European sides on salary packages.\n\n“Liverpool would also not be able to match the wages that Saudi clubs would be able to offer Mitoma,” TeamTalk note, signalling that the Reds may need to rely on project appeal and prestige rather than raw finances.\n\nWith Mitoma entering the final two years of his contract, Brighton’s business model suggests they may sell rather than renew. Liverpool, aware of this, will be watching the situation closely.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThere’s plenty to admire about Kaoru Mitoma, but this report should be taken with a degree of caution if you’re a sceptical Liverpool fan.\n\nFirstly, the £80m price tag feels steep—especially for a player who, while clearly talented, has not been consistently elite across a full Premier League season. Mitoma’s bursts of brilliance have been exciting, but are they worth that kind of investment in a window where Liverpool need reinforcements across defence, midfield and potentially at striker?\n\nSecondly, there’s the question of fit. Luis Díaz, despite the noise around his future, remains under contract, and Cody Gakpo continues to show promise. Adding another wide player without significant outgoings could unbalance the squad.\n\nFinancially, this also feels like a tough ask. If Liverpool really are chasing Alexander Isak, as reported, then pursuing both him and Mitoma seems unlikely unless substantial sales are made.\n\nThere’s no denying Mitoma could add something different to the frontline—but unless Brighton lower their demands, or Díaz departs, it’s hard to see this deal being a priority. For now, it may be more smoke than fire."}

David Lynch, speaking to Dave Davis for Anfield Index, has provided an intriguing nugget: Liverpool “definitely like” RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons. And while interest doesn’t always equate to action, this one carries weight.\n\nSimons has been linked with a switch to Merseyside, in a move that could be worth up to £70million.\n\nA Complicated Fit for a Complex Talent\n\nSimons is no ordinary target. Still just 21, he’s already been at the heart of multiple rebuilds—first at PSV, then PSG, and now at RB Leipzig. His flair, technical skill, and positional versatility make him an obvious asset, but as Lynch points out:\n\n“Harvey Elliott and Dominik Szoboszlai are already in the attacking midfielder position, then on the left there’s Luis Diaz and Cody Gakpo. So something has got to give in those positions to make this a possibility.”\n\nThe issue isn’t about quality—Simons has plenty of that. It’s about squad architecture, balance, and planning. Arne Slot inherits a team brimming with attacking midfielders and wide forwards. Adding another, even one as talented as Simons, could cause congestion unless there’s movement out.\n\nTransfer Reality Check\n\nOne of the most revealing points Lynch made in the Anfield Index interview was about the nature of Simons’ Leipzig deal:\n\n“He looks pretty much nailed on to leave RB Leipzig this summer because he only signed a two-year contract.”\n\nThat detail cannot be overstated. A short-term deal at a club like Leipzig is a neon sign to the market. Simons may well have intended Leipzig as a stepping stone, and with his trajectory, a Premier League move would make sense.\n\nBut Liverpool aren’t operating in a vacuum. Manchester United have been linked. Arsenal too. And with his pedigree, Barcelona may sniff around again. As Lynch rightly notes,\n\n“Whether that comes to anything this summer depends a lot on the competition around him and where you can fit him in the squad.”\n\nIn short, the player may be keen, the club may be admiring—but unless someone exits, it’s just admiration for now.\n\nArne Slot’s System Could Tip the Scales\n\nYet, this is where Arne Slot’s influence becomes more than just a managerial curiosity. He favours fluid systems with interchangeable attacking roles—a setup where a player like Simons could thrive. He doesn’t restrict creative talents; he empowers them.\n\nAnd if, for example, Cody Gakpo were to move into a more central striking role, or if interest in Luis Diaz from Spain materialises into something more concrete, Liverpool might suddenly have a slot—literally and figuratively.\n\nA front four of Szoboszlai, Elliott, Simons and Nunez, rotating with Gakpo and Jota, could offer the kind of depth needed to challenge on all fronts. But again, that’s contingent on movement—Liverpool don’t stockpile stars for the sake of it.\n\nEyes on the Market\n\nSo what does it all mean for now? As Lynch so succinctly put it:\n\n“In terms of whether Liverpool act on their interest, there has to be spots opened up in the squad before anything happens.”\n\nLiverpool fans would do well to temper excitement with realism. This isn’t the first time a young talent has been admired but not pursued. Simons is clearly liked, possibly loved—but a summer move depends not just on desire, but on design.\n\nFor now, the club is watching. But in the chaotic theatre of the transfer market, admiration can become action overnight."}

David Lynch, speaking to Dave Davis for Anfield Index, has all but confirmed that Virgil Van Dijk will sign a new deal imminently, with the formal announcement expected before Sunday’s trip to Leicester.\n\n“I would expect it this week because it’s pretty much all done as far as I understand,” Lynch stated. “It’s when not if, so I would be surprised if we get to the Leicester City game on Sunday and it hasn’t been announced by then.”\n\nVan Dijk’s Value in Transition\n\nThe timing of the news could hardly be better. Van Dijk’s late winner against West Ham secured a vital 2-1 win, leaving Liverpool needing just two victories from their final six games to seal the Premier League title. It was the kind of moment that reminded fans—and perhaps decision-makers at the club—why keeping him is non-negotiable.\n\nThere’s a certain irony in how often supporters are gripped by fear when it comes to contract renewals, especially for ageing players. But as Lynch pointed out, much of that anxiety may have been avoidable.\n\n“It’s exciting and good news for Liverpool and there has been so much time wasted by so many people worrying about it this season,” he said.\n\nIn truth, Van Dijk has never appeared to waver. He’s spoken like a man who sees his future at Anfield, and his performances—particularly in big games—suggest he remains the emotional and tactical anchor of this Liverpool side.\n\nStrategic Planning Begins with Certainty\n\nSlot’s appointment marked a new era, but it would have been unwise to tear down all pillars at once. With James Milner, Jordan Henderson, and Roberto Firmino already part of recent departures, Van Dijk’s extension brings vital balance to the transition.\n\n“You could look back at our podcasts at the start of the season, and we both said that we expect Mohamed Salah and Virgil Van Dijk to renew, whilst Trent Alexander-Arnold would be trickier – and that’s exactly what has happened,” Lynch continued.\n\nIt’s a fair reflection of Liverpool’s internal dynamics. Salah and Van Dijk, experienced but still impactful, offer leadership and reliability, whereas Trent’s renewal touches on questions of ambition, positional role, and the club’s long-term strategy.\n\nSetting the Tone for a Busy Summer\n\nBeyond the feel-good factor, Van Dijk’s renewal allows Liverpool to tackle the summer with momentum. With defensive reinforcements likely to be on the shopping list—given Ibrahima Konaté’s fitness record and Joe Gomez’s potential departure—it’s essential that the club can plan around a figure like Van Dijk, rather than replace him.\n\n“Now Liverpool can move forward and it’s a very good start to a summer that is expected to be very busy,” Lynch concluded.\n\nIf Van Dijk’s contract is the first domino, it’s a well-chosen one. It suggests Liverpool are determined not only to build but to build smart—retaining leaders, maintaining standards, and setting the tone for what could be a new period of success under Arne Slot.\n\nHis header at Anfield last weekend wasn’t just a match-winner; it was a symbolic reminder of who still sets the tone in this Liverpool team."}

A player hits form, earns admiration, and suddenly the drums from Spain begin to beat. This time, it’s Alexis Mac Allister—Liverpool’s metronomic midfielder—who’s being “studied” by Real Madrid, according to Liverpool.com, via reports in Marca.\n\nFresh from a season where he’s settled in seamlessly under the Anfield lights, Mac Allister has become central to the side’s midfield rebuild. His ability to dictate tempo, link play and stay composed under pressure has not gone unnoticed—not just by fans, but by clubs with deeper pockets and broader European reach.\n\nMadrid, still licking their wounds from their own structural disarray in midfield at times this campaign, are reportedly considering Mac Allister as a potential solution. But if the noise from Spain is rising, the response from Merseyside has been quiet—measured, even.\n\nFather’s Comments Offer Clarity\n\nAmid the swirl of speculation, Carlos Mac Allister—Alexis’ father and a regular sounding board in such affairs—offered perspective:\n\n“For now, I don’t think so. Time will tell. Alexis is very happy where he is. He lives in Manchester, and on the block where he lives is (Andy) Robertson, (Joe) Gomez, and four blocks away is Licha Martinez.”\n\nThere’s a calm in those words. No immediate movement, no hidden agendas. Just a family grounded in the present, with no urgency to chase the shine of the Bernabeu—at least not yet.\n\nStill Open to a Spanish Future\n\nMac Allister himself hasn’t slammed the door on a move abroad, but his honesty hasn’t stirred panic either.\n\n“Yes, why not?” he said in December. “It’s a country I like a lot… I would definitely like to play in Spain one day. But right now, I’m very comfortable at Liverpool and I don’t think about what might happen in the future.”\n\nThe tone? Not flirtatious, but realistic. Footballers are allowed dreams. And if Spain is part of his long-term vision, so be it. The key here is his satisfaction with life at Liverpool—and under Arne Slot, who’ll have big plans for the Argentine next season.\n\nTiming and Context Matter\n\nIn a summer where Trent Alexander-Arnold’s future looms uncertain, and the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah are navigating contract negotiations, another potential Madrid exit rumour might seem like a headache. But Salah has just signed a new deal, and Van Dijk could soon follow. There’s no great exodus. Just gossip. And right now, that’s all this appears to be.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nIf you’re a sceptical Liverpool fan, you’ve seen this all before. Real Madrid whispers, a conveniently timed quote, and suddenly a saga is born. It feels like déjà vu, whether it’s Xabi Alonso, Steven Gerrard, or even Sadio Mané in years past. The Spanish press love a “Liverpool-to-Madrid” pipeline. But this time, it feels more fiction than fact.\n\nMac Allister has integrated brilliantly—he’s one of the few consistent midfielders in a team transitioning into a new era under Arne Slot. His father’s comments don’t exactly scream urgency to leave. And Mac Allister himself? He’s honest, but hardly plotting an exit. His admiration for Spain is cultural, not contractual.\n\nThe scepticism, though, comes from experience. Liverpool have lost players to European giants before, often when things look stable. So while there’s no fire here yet, fans will keep a cautious eye.\n\nStill, in this case, the situation feels more like media mischief than Madrid manoeuvring. If anything, it’s a compliment—Madrid don’t come knocking unless you’re doing something right. For now, Mac Allister stays, and Liverpool keep building."}

Yet, that’s precisely what Liverpool may need to do this summer as they consider their options at centre-back — and the name Dean Huijsen has entered the discussion once more.\n\nIn a recent discussion on Anfield Index, football journalist David Lynch joined Dave Davis to share insight on Liverpool’s potential summer moves. Speaking on the Reds’ reported interest in the young AFC Bournemouth defender, Lynch said plainly: “I’ve been sceptical about this link because other clubs can definitely offer him the minutes that Liverpool can’t really guarantee.”\n\nIt’s a fair point — and one that gets to the heart of the issue. Huijsen, at just 19, is not lacking suitors. With Serie A and La Liga clubs circling, the Dutch-eligible centre-half can likely secure regular starts elsewhere. Can Liverpool, with Virgil van Dijk still commanding a starting role and Ibrahima Konaté (for now) the assumed long-term partner, really make a compelling case?\n\nSquad Spots and Selection Dilemmas\n\nIf there’s any opening in this squad, it will have to be prised open by departures — something Lynch didn’t shy away from suggesting: “I do expect Liverpool to sign a centre-back this summer because I expect Joe Gomez to leave, which would mean the player coming in would be third or fourth choice.”\n\nThere’s both intrigue and uncertainty here. On one hand, Gomez has offered versatility and valuable squad depth. On the other, his role has been gradually diminished. If he does leave, it paves the way for a new face, albeit still one in a rotational role.\n\nBut Huijsen isn’t just any prospect. He’s tactically sharp, composed under pressure, and technically excellent in build-up play — a modern defender made for Slot’s potential system. Still, it’s that nagging issue of minutes. As Lynch rightly noted, “At the moment, I’m not sure that there’s a place in the squad that he would be keen to take up.”\n\nKonaté Contract Clouds the Picture\n\nOne twist in the narrative lies with Konaté. While fans consider him a nailed-on starter when fit, there’s now a degree of uncertainty. Lynch revealed: “There is doubts at the moment though over Ibou Konate’s future as he hasn’t agreed a new contract yet.”\n\nIt’s a line that may have slipped under the radar — but it shouldn’t. If Liverpool decide to act pre-emptively, as they have in the past with contract standoffs, Huijsen becomes a much more realistic target. It’s not inconceivable to see a scenario where Liverpool make a sale and turn that into a proactive reinforcement plan.\n\n“And if Liverpool chose to act decisively over that, then perhaps a move for Huijsen is more likely,” Lynch added — a subtle, yet telling line that speaks volumes. This summer, it won’t be just about adding bodies; it’ll be about reading the market, getting ahead of problems, and adapting to the decisions of others.\n\nSales Pitch Must Match Ambition\n\nIt’s clear that Huijsen will have options. Top-flight football. European campaigns. Defined starting roles. What Liverpool have to offer is something less tangible — a project, a learning curve, and a place in one of the most tactically ambitious teams in Europe under Arne Slot.\n\n“We will see. It’s another one where it’s an interesting storyline going into the summer but can they create the package and the sales pitch to get him on board,” Lynch concluded.\n\nThat’s the real question — not just whether Liverpool can afford Huijsen, but whether they can convince him. There’s a fine line between ambition and opportunity.

It went beyond wages and extensions—it was about what comes next for the club. The Dutchman, still the figurehead of this side and its on-pitch general, made one thing clear: Liverpool cannot afford to stand still.\n\nWith the Premier League title all but wrapped up—potentially with the same swaggering margin as 2019/20—Van Dijk has underlined the club’s requirements for continued success. “Whatever happens in terms of players going out, players coming in, I think it should be a big summer,” he said. “I think they’re planning to make it a big summer, so we all have to trust the board, as a Liverpool-connected fan, to do the right job.”\n\nThat’s not just a player protecting his legacy. It’s a captain demanding ambition from the boardroom.\n\nFull Pre-Season with Slot Crucial\n\nThere’s no hiding from the fact that Arne Slot has inherited a high bar. But Van Dijk believes time is on their side this year. With no major men’s international tournament clogging up the calendar, the defender sees an opportunity to rebuild properly—with intent and intensity.\n\n“I think we one hundred percent can improve,” he said. “If you take it all the way back to the [previous] summer, I didn’t have a proper pre-season. You don’t have time to work on what the manager really wants in terms of a training camp.”\n\nThat will change this summer. “There is time for the team to work on what the manager wants and I think that will then improve the team. There are still so many things to improve.”\n\nVan Dijk isn’t wrong. For all of Liverpool’s success, it hasn’t always been smooth. But a full pre-season offers a foundation—and it’s a foundation Van Dijk is determined to build on.\n\nQuality of Competition Still High\n\nSome have dismissed Liverpool’s likely title triumph as a consequence of a weak Premier League field. Van Dijk bristles at the suggestion.\n\n“We shouldn’t forget the quality that the Premier League possesses, especially this season in my opinion,” he said. “It’s incredible how everyone can beat everyone. Brentford got a draw at Arsenal. Chelsea-Ipswich was a draw… listen, it’s just difficult.”\n\nIt’s a reminder that no title is won by default in this division. The margins are always thin—even when the table says otherwise.\n\nOne Hand on the Trophy\n\nAs the finish line approaches, Van Dijk knows how close Liverpool are. “We are two wins, six points away from glory. I know what it means to the club and I know what it will bring us if it happens. Most of the players don’t so when it happens, it will be beautiful… but we still have a job to do.”\n\nA contract may be signed in ink, but Van Dijk’s real signature is on the pitch—demanding, commanding, and always thinking beyond himself."}

I think Mo Salah had his moment a few days ago and I’m sure that will be the case with Virgil van Dijk next week.”\n\nIt’s a subtle but telling nod from Carragher, who remains closely connected to the rhythm of Anfield. If Salah’s extension is the first domino, Van Dijk’s deal may not be far behind.\n\nVan Dijk Poised to Extend Stay at Anfield\n\nThe 32-year-old Dutch defender had hinted earlier this month that an update on his future was forthcoming, stating there would be news “soon”. That optimism appears well-founded, particularly in light of Carragher’s remarks and the club’s broader ambition to build stability ahead of the new era under Arne Slot.\n\nVan Dijk, who has been a towering presence in Liverpool’s back line since his arrival in 2018, remains integral to the club’s leadership group. With Trent Alexander-Arnold heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid, keeping Van Dijk becomes even more important—not just from a tactical perspective, but from a dressing room standpoint too.\n\nSalah’s Commitment Boosts Recruitment Potential\n\nSalah’s new deal, and the certainty it brings, extends beyond his own influence on the pitch. As Carragher pointed out, it has ramifications for Liverpool’s summer recruitment plans.\n\n“It’s not just Liverpool players now, probably more for future Liverpool players, maybe players Liverpool are looking to tout in the summer.”\n\n“The manager mentioned that in his press conference. When you’re speaking to players and their agents over these next few months, it’s always helpful to say that Mohamed Salah’s staying next season.”\n\nIn a summer where Liverpool aim to reshape parts of the squad, having a figure like Salah publicly committed can be used as a persuasive tool during negotiations. Potential signings will be reassured by the fact that the club’s most prolific forward remains part of the project.\n\nMomentum Building for Contract Clarity\n\nSalah’s long-anticipated renewal ends months of speculation, particularly amid interest from Saudi Arabia and growing frustration among supporters. Speaking after putting pen to paper, he said:\n\n“Of course I’m very excited – we have a great team now… I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football. I have had the best years of my career here.”\n\nFor Liverpool, the job now is to carry that momentum forward. Carragher’s comments suggest Van Dijk’s contract could be next—and that would offer further reassurance that the club is securing the spine of its squad for the challenges ahead."}

Ben Jacobs of talkSPORT reports that Al-Ahli are preparing a monumental €350m [£303m] offer for Real Madrid’s Vinicius Jr — a potential world-record deal that eclipses even Neymar’s 2017 move to PSG. If successful, the ramifications of that approach could be felt at Anfield.\n\n“The club making the approach are Al-Ahli,” Jacobs confirms, “which means Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr will have to look elsewhere for reinforcements.” Their gaze, it seems, has already landed on Luis Diaz.\n\nDiaz as Plan B — or Plan A?\n\nWith Vinicius Jr’s future in flux and his attitude increasingly questioned in the Spanish capital, a ripple effect is in motion. Jacobs notes that “Diaz is the most likely alternative, having emerged as one of Europe’s top wingers since moving to Liverpool.”\n\nAnd he’s not wrong. With 15 goals and five assists this season, Diaz is thriving under Arne Slot and playing the best football of his career. Since arriving from Porto in January 2022 for £37.5m, the Colombian has lit up Anfield with his direct style, relentless energy, and eye for goal. But his contract expires in 2027, meaning Liverpool may soon face a contract conundrum.\n\nReal Madrid’s Vinicius Problem\n\nVinicius Jr, for all his brilliance last season — including a Champions League final goal — now finds himself the subject of public scrutiny. His straight red against Valencia, disciplinary issues, and clashing with fans and teammates have all raised questions.\n\nJacobs’ report outlines this shift: “Since then he’s seen both the media and fans show signs of turning on him,” with MARCA even calling him a “problem for Real Madrid.”\n\nReal’s acquisition of Kylian Mbappe hasn’t helped. With both stars operating from the left, friction was inevitable. That tension, plus Saudi Arabia’s open chequebook, creates the perfect storm.\n\nDecision Time at Liverpool\n\nLuis Diaz’s future, by contrast, appears tied more to timing than attitude. Liverpool must now weigh up resisting financial temptation or selling high at a time of record valuations. Al Nassr’s £64m swoop for Diaz’s countryman Jhon Duran shows how inflated this market has become.\n\nAnd while £303m for Vinicius feels absurd, nothing in modern football is truly shocking. As Jacobs writes, “That may well see Arne Slot’s bosses faced with an irresistible offer from big-spending SPL for their star Colombian.”\n\nLiverpool’s transfer stance has long been one of pragmatism. If the Saudis miss out on Vinicius, Diaz becomes a prime target — not as a compromise, but as a statement.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool fans, this report sets off more alarms than it does applause. Diaz has been one of the few consistent outlets in a season of attacking transition. Losing him — especially not long after the departures of Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino — would create a vacuum not easily filled.\n\nSure, the Saudi money is eye-watering, but at what cost? Fans want to see players who want to be at Liverpool — not those tempted by riches elsewhere. Diaz has never looked like he’s itching for a move, but if his head gets turned, can the club convince him to stay with a new deal and a clear vision under Arne Slot?\n\nMore urgently, where’s the plan if he goes? There’s no guarantee that the club can find a like-for-like replacement, especially with top-tier wingers now commanding massive fees. And if Mbappe’s arrival makes Vinicius disposable, that sets a new — and dangerous — bar for how top clubs handle elite talent.\n\nLiverpool’s stance in the coming months will reveal plenty: whether they see Diaz as untouchable or as the next asset to cash in on."}

I do my best to make sure everything that is posted to SimpleTalk.com is as correct as I can get it. All of my career was spent as a specialist of sorts. I spent my time with:\n\nSQL Server Tools and Techniques\n\nI suppose that wasn’t really bulleted list worthy, but it is true. I did study and work with SQL Server as a DBA, Developer, and Architect, using the relational and dimensional capabilities. Maybe that probably should have been a bulleted list. This is a fun article series, so I am taking a few liberties with the writing too.\n\nThe problem\n\nBecause I am not a generalist, I often lean on other people to do some of the technical edits. The problem with finding technical editors is that you really need to trust them more than actual writers.\n\nThis probably seems counterintuitive, but you don’t see a technical editors mistakes in the same way you see a writer’s. If a writer says that 1+1=3; this is likely a typo, especially if they have also said it was 2 in other places. You see a lot more of their work. But a tech editor might actually think 1+1=3; and just think “nice work”. (Naturally I am thinking less about elementary math and more about things like “shrinking your SQL Server database every day is a good thing to do” or something else completely wrong. Definitely possible that they don’t know what they are doing.)\n\nAs an editor, you put a lot of trust into your technical editor, especially since as the editor of a site, you put your stamp of approval on the content.\n\nThe test\n\nSo, I got this idea to test out a few LLM, ChatGPT and the Web and Office Copilot at the very least and see how they handle a load of bad advice. So I put out a question on X, asking:\n\n“A request! Send me your most realistic, but worst, SQL Server management advice. I want to test (and write an article) about using AI to fact check writing.”\n\nAnd thanks to Anders Pedersen, Koen Verbeeck, Jennifer Stirrup, Matt Oates, Marc Brooks, Michael Fisher, Rui Romano, Wes Crokett; I got this a set of advice that is all delightfully bad. I will list that advice in the next section.\n\nWith this advice I will write a couple of articles. The body of advice will stay the same, but the header will change.\n\nOne that explicitly states that this is a set of best practice advice that you can’t get along without.\n\nOne that explicitly states that these are a set of worst practices.\n\nThis should show me how much it is paying attention to the advice, and how it replies to the same advice given in different ways. After I finish this process, I will consider using one of these LLMs to generate a paper of bad advice, and again the worst advice and repeat this process.\n\nWhat I am hoping for\n\nOnce I got the advice gathered, I realized I was mildly terrified by this process. Why? Because it is possible that either the LLM will give me perfect, nuanced answers as to why these suggestions are typically incorrect or it will say, these suggestions all seem to be valid advice.\n\nOne means easily be replaced by a machine. The second means the tools are useless for technical editing. I am more concerned by the latter, because I rarely do get a “this is technically incorrect” from asking for review of a document. I did say rarely, which is encouraging, but this test should help me decide.\n\nThe test data\n\nIn this section, I will present the tips I was given, and then I will link to a .zip file with the two text versions of the article that I mentioned saying these are and are not, good tips. Here are those tips:\n\nTesting in production is the best way to test because production is ‘clean’.\n\nDon’t need a backup or restore plan – we run all of the ETL pipelines again every time we lose the database (sidebar note: this happened frequently)\n\nAutogrow files so they don’t have to think about it\n\nStore images for your website on the same server as your database\n\nNeed SQL Server Analysis Services, the engine, SSIS and DQ? Why not run them all on the same machine so they can talk to one another better?\n\nUse auto-shrink to keep your data files lean and mean\n\nGive all developers SA in production so you, the DBA, don’t have to be woke up at night to fix their deployments\n\nAlways use an index on a binary column as the first segment as it halves the search space. This is especially useful for active vs. inactive flags.\n\nAlways give your server less than or equal to 64 GB of RAM when your database is 1 TB in size.\n\nAlways use the object-first ORM approach to generate your database for optimal and efficient schemas. Avoid database-specific features like table-valued functions or materialized views to prevent vendor lock-in without added benefits.\n\nAlways use NOLOCK in each and every SQL statement.\n\nYou shouldn’t change the default MAXDOP, as it has been set for you to handle all situations.\n\nSo those are the raw details, and in the text you will note that I have expounded just a little bit on each of these to make a section with a paragraph or two, giving some background on why these are “good” ideas. Writing that text definitely did not turn my stomach at all!\n\nHere is the zip file with the two versions of the article in both .txt and .docx formats (I did not want them entering the search engines and dropping the Simple Talk authority value!)\n\nWhat next\n\nIn the coming articles, I will take the two articles and test them with the different LLM tools one article at a time and include some of the output. This should let us know at least a little bit about what it can do when answers are wrong.\n\nDepending on how this goes, I will probably try a more subtle approach (try an article that is mostly right, and add a stinker in there), and then maybe see what happens when I ask it to rewrite these articles. I know it will be fun, and I hope it will help people to see just how much they can trust the mainstream LLM tools to help them make sure their writing makes sense."}

The club, a tapestry of tradition and modern excellence, now faces the possible departure of one of its most iconic academy graduates. Trent Alexander-Arnold, a symbol of the club’s identity and innovation, is expected to leave Anfield at the end of the season as a free agent. David Ornstein has confirmed, “The expectation is that he will leave for Real Madrid as a free agent at the end of the season.”\n\nWhile Mohamed Salah has signed a two-year extension and Virgil van Dijk is believed to be close to committing his future, Alexander-Arnold’s potential departure underscores a concerning lapse in planning. As Ornstein noted, “Perhaps some criticism for Liverpool, for FSG on that front, for leaving it late on a younger player who has come through the system here at Anfield.”\n\nNunez Falling Short of Expectations\n\nAlongside Alexander-Arnold, Darwin Nunez also finds himself on the verge of an Anfield exit. Brought in under Jürgen Klopp with a reputation for chaos and creativity, Nunez has struggled to cement a consistent role under Arne Slot’s system.\n\nHis numbers paint a stark picture: five Premier League goals in 25 appearances, ranking only fifth in the squad for goals. His average of 0.4 key passes and 1.2 shots per game places him well down the list of Liverpool’s attacking contributors. Despite being a physical presence and producing important moments – such as the winning assist against PSG and a brace against Brentford – his match rating of 6.52 ranks 17th in the squad. Ornstein’s conclusion is clear: “Darwin Nunez [is] expected to leave as well.”\n\nRebuild Demands Precision and Boldness\n\nWith Arne Slot preparing for his second summer at the helm, the challenge is no longer one of evolution but of full-scale transformation. Little was done last summer in terms of incoming transfers. This window promises activity and intensity.\n\nOrnstein reports that Liverpool are “in the mix for Dean Huijsen at Bournemouth, the centre-half, and Milos Kerkez, the left-back at Bournemouth.” There is also mention of the need for a new forward, with Nunez’s likely exit leaving a notable gap in the front line.\n\nThis is no ordinary transfer period. It is a summer where decisions will shape the spine of Liverpool’s future – defensively, creatively, and in attack.\n\nLegacy of Nunez Remains Unwritten\n\nNunez’s Liverpool career has been defined by extremes. With 40 goals in 138 games, and 13 goals for Uruguay in 35 appearances, his numbers are far from catastrophic. But expectations were stratospheric. His explosive style thrilled fans but too often left results lacking. His flashes of brilliance – not least his contributions in Europe and January’s double against Brentford – showed what might have been.\n\nWhether he departs this summer or stays to fight for his place, his time at Anfield will be remembered for what it promised as much as what it delivered."}

Juan Cole’s remarks at their conference.\n\nThe Islamic Peace Studies Initiative\n\nJuan Cole and Samer Ali have directed the Islamic Peace Studies Initiative at the Center for Middle Eastern and North African Studies in the International Institute of the University of Michigan from 2016. The initiative sought to stimulate thinking and writing on the intersection of Peace Studies as an academic field with Islamic Studies, an intersection that our literature search suggested was all too rare. Other religions, including Christianity and Buddhism, were much better represented in the Peace Studies field. The Initiative led to two courses at the University of Michigan, two conferences, and two books — a monograph by Cole on the Prophet Muhammad and an edited book out of the conferences, edited by Cole. This paper will discuss the project and its major findings.\n\n\n\nThe Islamic Peace Studies Initiative: Juan Cole\n\nTranscript of Juan Cole’s remarks, computer-generated at YouTube and cleaned up by ChatGPT. Caveat emptor.\n\nJuan Cole: So — I’d like to talk a little bit about the Islamic Peace Studies Initiative at the University of Michigan.\n\nThis is an initiative that was begun by myself and Samer Ali at the Center for Middle Eastern and North African Studies in 2016. The context of it, of course, had been the long years of the U.S. so-called War on Terror — the dramatic events of al-Qaeda, and then the rise of ISIL. Samer and I felt that Islamic Studies and Middle Eastern Studies were being securitized in unfortunate ways.\n\nWithout wanting to deny that extremism exists — and has been a significant factor — we felt the emphasis on extremism was out of proportion to the reality. When one looks at the entirety of the Muslim world, other things have been going on — and have been going on for 1,400 years — which were being ignored.\n\nSo we proposed to our [University of Michigan] International Institute an Islamic Peace Studies Initiative to promote academic research on this subject — and to promote the professionalization and recognition of this subfield.\n\nWe did a literature search in Index Islamicus using the Boolean search terms “Islam” and “peace” — and we came up with about 77 articles. Index Islamicus tries to index everything written in European languages about Islam since 1500. There are thousands and thousands of entries — so even if the search was in some way inadequate, or there were other search terms that might have been more fruitful — we can see that this is a neglected subject in European-language research.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the International Journal of Peace Studies, which is the foremost journal in the field — at George Mason University — seems to have published few or no articles on Islam. Perhaps some articles set in Muslim societies — but not on Islam per se.\n\nIn contrast to this dearth of work on Islam and peace, peace studies itself — as an academic field — has become well established over the years. In some ways, it began in 1955, when Johan Galtung became the chair in peace studies at the University of Oslo. By now, there are 150 colleges and universities just in the United States that offer courses in the area of peace studies.\n\nPeace studies is very broadly conceived and diverse — there’s political philosophy of peace, security studies, practical conflict resolution. The religious dimension of peace studies has been important — many peace studies programs are housed at denominational institutions. The Kroc Institute for Peace Studies at Notre Dame is one example. Haverford, and traditionally Mennonite and Quaker peace church institutions, often have peace studies as well. Secular institutions also participate.\n\nThere’s been a fair amount of work on peace and Christianity — peace and Buddhism — so religion as a dimension of this subject is well recognized. But again — not, on the whole, with regard to Islam.\n\nWe received funding from the International Institute — they were very kind — and we moved forward with our first “Peace in Islam, Islam in Peace” conference in Ann Arbor in March of 2017. I won’t read the whole program, but I’ll share the participants so that you can get an idea of the diversity of topics and people represented.\n\nI should mention that I was concerned the subject should be treated in the context of the global Muslim world. Africa, for instance, has been an important site for peace studies within Islam — and it was well represented [Rudoph Ware, Lamin Sanneh, Abdullahi An-Naim.]\n\nWe did not want to make the mistake of essentializing — saying that Sufism is always about peace. Because of course, there has been militant Sufism — but we did include a paper on that. On the other hand, Sherman Jackson gave us a paper on the fundamentalist turn toward peace in Egypt after the 1990s. We also looked at Salafism and the early Salafis — we argued they should be read in this context.\n\nWe did receive some critiques — some nervousness was expressed by invitees. Some turned us down, unsure of what we were about. My guess is that the U.S. government’s CVE (Countering Violent Extremism) program — under Homeland Security — has gotten a bad name in the American Muslim community as being Islamophobic or a brainwashing operation. We had — and have — nothing to do with CVE. We’ve not taken money from the U.S. government.\n\nStill, I suspect that nervousness around CVE made people a bit suspicious about why we were focusing on this subject.\n\nAbdullahi An-Na’im, who gave the keynote at our first conference, also included some critiques — he worried it might become paternalistic — white people showing Muslims how to make peace, and so forth. I hope you can see from our invite list that this was not our intention — we wanted scholars of Muslim heritage to be prominently represented in this project. We aimed for a good mix of people — and as we conceived the project, it was an intellectual and academic program.\n\nWe certainly had no intention of trying to train peace negotiators or anything of that sort.\n\nIn spring of 2019, we held a second conference — this time, less sociological and more focused on the inner life of Islam and Muslims, looking at peace and serenity as values. Again, we aimed for a diverse set of respondents. Our keynote that year was Dr. Irfan Omar of Marquette University.\n\nUltimately, these two conferences — along with our other activities — culminated in the book Peace Movements in Islam, published in December 2021 by I.B. Tauris (Bloomsbury), who I believe may be represented at your conference.\n\n\n\nPeace Movements in Islam: History, Religion, and Politics, edited by Juan Cole. IB Tauris/ Bloomsbury, 2021. Click here to buy.\n\nThe referees for the book — we received three long referee reports — were very enthusiastic. One said the book could be “potentially field-forming.”\n\nI know there are other teams and scholars working on this subject throughout the world. Asma Afsaruddin at Indiana University Bloomington has been one — and she kindly contributed a chapter to our book. There are others as well. There have been a few other such anthologies — for example, one around 2010 by Douglas Johnston with the U.S. Institute of Peace. So it’s not unprecedented — I don’t want to make undue claims for our project.\n\nBut I do think it may be the first thoroughgoing project of this sort to result in a book that is theorizing the possibility of a subfield of Islamic peace studies.\n\nMany of our contributors were of Muslim heritage, and we tried to address a wide range of phenomena — Senegal is there, Bosnia is there, India is there, and so on.\n\nI included a paper of my own — looking at peace verses in the Qur’an. These verses are numerous — and I believe they’ve been under-theorized in the field. I used many of these in my own 2018 monograph, Muhammad: Prophet of Peace Amid the Clash of Empires — but there I used them in writing the biography of the Prophet. In the paper for the book, I focused specifically on the Qur’an itself, trying to do a more analytical study.\n\nAs Abd al-Haqq rightly said — you can let the Qur’an comment on itself — and I tried to look at how the verses interplay with one another. I argue that peace, conciliation, and peacemaking are absolutely central to the Qur’an. Even in the Medinan period — where you have what I consider to be “just war” verses — the emphasis on ultimate conciliation continues in that period as well.\n\nSo — thank you for letting me give this little overview of our project and of the book that resulted.\n\n—-\n\nPS: The initiative ran 2016-2022.\n\nPPS see also Juan Cole, “The Great Sufi Qushayri on “Responding to Evil with the Greatest Good”."}

Due to the record number of submissions, we are thrilled to feature an additional 39 manuscripts showcasing the growing interest and groundbreaking science driven by long-read technologies.\n\nIn this Special Issue of Genome Research, we have assembled a diverse collection of articles highlighting novel methods, applications, and insights emerging from long-read technologies. This Special Issue contains four reviews, two perspectives, 16 research, and 17 method articles. While the long-read research primarily focuses on sequencing, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi-based sequencing, this Special Issue also highlights another long-read technology: optical genome mapping (OGM). Although not sequencing-based, OGM is particularly valuable for detecting large complex structural variants (SVs) and chromosomal aberrations.\n\nThe maturation of long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies, marked by enhanced accuracy, increased throughput, and reduced costs, has propelled a substantial expansion in human genetics and genomics research. This trend is clearly reflected in this Special Issue, where four review articles, authored by leading experts, and two perspective articles, predominantly emphasize human LRS application. These reviews and perspectives explore the contributions of LRS to human population sequencing, advancing our understanding of human genome architecture and SVs with improved genome assemblies and graph genomes (Rausch et al. 2025) and rare disease diagnostics, uncovering previously undetected variants in rare disease patients, with particular attention to SVs, short tandem repeat (STR) expansions, and variant phasing (Del Gobbo and Boycott 2025). They provide an update on the emerging use of LRS for direct readout of DNA modifications, notably DNA methylation (Montano and Timp 2025), and provide novel insights into cancer-related genomic and epigenomic alterations (Li et al. 2025).

Breathe onto the bathroom mirror just to see how amazing your breath looks. The moment you start acting like life is a blessing, I assure you it will start to feel like one. And when you start the day in a mindful state like this, it’s easier to focus more effectively on what matters most.\n\nIf you’d like to practice starting your mornings more mindfully in the weeks ahead, below you will find 52 good morning quotes. I choose one of these quotes every Monday morning and sit quietly for two minutes, repeating it silently in my mind as if I were meditating. I also write it on a sticky note and put it next to my computer monitor for the duration of the week. This weekly ritual has helped reduce unnecessary stress in my life by reminding me to keep things simple, peaceful, and in perspective. Perhaps this practice can add value to your life too, for the next 52 weeks and beyond…\n\n1. The secret to being grateful is no secret. You choose to be grateful. Then you do it again and again, every day. When you forget, begin again.\n\n2. If you worry too much about what might be, and wonder too long about what might have been, you will ignore and completely miss what is.\n\n3. You don’t know what the future will bring, so your best strategy for living is to make the best and most positive use of the present.\n\n4. Two things, more than anything else, define you daily: Your patience when you are struggling, and your attitude when you are not.\n\n5. Patience is not about waiting — it’s the ability to keep a positive attitude while working hard for what you believe in.\n\n6. It’s not selfish to enjoy life. What’s selfish is to insist on being negative despite all the positive possibilities available to you.\n\n7. Before you waste it on anger, resentment, spite or envy, think of how precious and irreplaceable your time is today.\n\n8. You may be exhausted. You may be discouraged. You may feel uncomfortable. No matter what, your best option is to move forward one tiny step at a time.\n\n9. Those times when you don’t feel like being positive are the times when choosing to be positive makes the biggest difference.\n\n10. It’s impossible to accomplish what you assume you cannot do. Be careful not to become a prisoner of your own negative assumptions.\n\n11. If you truly wish to improve your self-confidence, self-esteem, and self-worth, stop allowing other people to be responsible for them.\n\n12. Your track record for getting through hard days is 100% so far.\n\n13. When you fail to get what you want, consider that it just might be a blessing in disguise, enabling you to have something even better, soon.\n\n14. Use your struggles and frustrations today to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of the way you look at life.\n\n15. What may seem like a setback is really an opportunity for you to learn something new, and develop a more effective, more realistic strategy.\n\n16. Again and again, remind yourself why. With a strong enough reason why, you will be able to do what’s required at any time and in any circumstance.\n\n17. Be determined and ambitious, but not out of a desperate sense of need — do it out of a love for the possibilities. Appreciate your journey.\n\n18. Do your thing with passion and integrity even if folks don’t notice you. We do what we do not for an applause, but because we know it’s right.\n\n19. If the grass looks greener on the other side… Stop staring. Stop comparing. Stop complaining and start watering the grass you’re standing on.\n\n20. When you are lost in worry it’s easy to mistake your worries for reality, instead of recognizing that they are only thoughts.\n\n21. Whatever your challenge is, worrying about it won’t help. Either do something to address it, or do something to move past it.\n\n22. Unless you let go of what’s behind you, unless you forgive yourself, unless you forgive the situation, unless you accept that it’s over… you cannot move forward.\n\n23. Most people make themselves unhappy simply by finding it impossible to accept life just as it is presenting itself right now.\n\n24. You can’t calm the storm. What you can do is calm yourself, and the storm will gradually pass.\n\n25. Nothing is permanent. When you understand this, you can do almost anything you wish because you’re not trying to hold onto everything anymore.\n\n26. The most powerful changes happen when you take control of what you do have power over, instead of craving control over everything you don’t. (Read “The Untethered Soul”.)\n\n27. Too often we see ourselves as the past victim, rather than the creator of our present situation. This is why our life is so difficult to change from one moment to the next.\n\n28. When you are no longer able to change a situation, you are challenged to change yourself. And that changes everything.\n\n29. Being grateful in life doesn’t mean everything is perfect; it often means you’ve decided to look beyond the imperfections.\n\n30. Your life will improve only when you take small chances, and the first and most difficult chance you can take is to be honest with yourself.\n\n31. It’s not what you say to everyone else that determines your life; it’s what you whisper to yourself that has the greatest power.\n\n32. Awareness is not just noticing what’s going on around you, but what’s going on within you as well. (Keep your eyes open and your Self in mind.)\n\n33. Be careful about who you give the microphone and stage to in your life, especially when times are tough. Don’t just listen to the loudest voice. Slow down and listen to the truest one.\n\n34. Don’t let someone who has done nothing tell you how to do your thing. Don’t let small minds convince you that your ideas and dreams are too big.\n\n35. You can’t base your ideas of success and happiness on other people’s opinions and expectations.\n\n36. Sometimes you need to distance yourself to see things clearly again.\n\n37. Don’t be scared to walk alone down the path less traveled, and don’t be scared to appreciate every minute of it.\n\n38. Wherever your heart is — wherever your truth is — that’s where you will find your reason to smile.\n\n39. Don’t let not knowing how it’ll end keep you from beginning today. Uncertainty chases us out into the open where life’s true magic is waiting.\n\n40. You can’t be afraid to have certain conversations. It’s better to talk and find out, than to keep going and get nowhere. Communication is key.\n\n41. No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a peaceful way to live, and a beautiful legacy to leave behind.\n\n42. Changing the world doesn’t necessitate earth-shattering feats, but rather doing small things with great love. Think simple and consistent, not spectacular.\n\n43. Our days are always happier and more fulfilling when we give people around us a bit of our heart rather than a piece of our mind.\n\n44. Don’t judge someone harshly just because they’ve made different mistakes than you have.\n\n45. When you choose to see the good in others, you end up finding the good in yourself.\n\n46. Set an example. Do your best to treat people with kindness and respect, even those who are momentarily rude to you — not because they are nice, but because you are.\n\n47. Be thankful for all the rude, obnoxious, and difficult people you meet in life. They serve as important reminders of how NOT to live.\n\n48. There are no permanent jobs on this planet. We are all interning here. Learn from everyone, remain humble, and don’t forget to have some fun along the way.\n\n49. There’s no such thing as a self-made person. Someone else believed, encouraged, and invested in you. Be grateful and be that someone for others when you can.\n\n50. Accept what is, let go of what was, and have faith in your journey one day at a time.\n\n51. Every day is a new beginning; treat it that way. Stop thinking about what could have been and start looking at what can be starting today. (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Passion and Growth” chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)\n\n52. Right now it all starts over. The possibilities ahead are endless. Be strong enough to let go, wise enough to move forward, diligent enough to work hard, and patient enough to wait for what you are gradually earning.\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nWhat’s one additional quote or personal reminder that has given you some extra peace and clarity in life?

As a result, we enjoy excellent search engine ranking and placement, with articles immediately becoming indexed by the major search engines, including Google. We have always accepted guest contributions for publication, and while that is not changing, our publication rules and guidelines have recently changed. For full transparency, I wanted to explain what has changed and why.\n\nNever Behind a Paywall\n\nUnlike virtually every other publication in the industry, IPWatchdog has never published articles behind a paywall. And we diligently work to index all the articles we publish with LinkedIn, and we publish a free daily newsletter received by our most dedicated readers. Our approach to publishing and promoting articles—and the fact that they can be easily found and freely read by anyone and everyone—is why IPWatchdog.com is one of the largest intellectual property publications in the world, with nearly 1.1 million different, unique individuals visiting IPWatchdog.com in 2024 alone. Indeed, we know that in many respects IPWatchdog.com has become the publication of record for the industry, with many firms and individuals telling us they have canceled subscriptions to expensive news services because they view them as unnecessary.\n\nOur plan is to continue to put our foot on the accelerator, and to publish the best news and most accurate analysis and to keep that free of charge from the readers’ perspective. And truthfully it is hard to imagine any circumstances where we would ever change this core belief. We are fundamentally opposed to publishing articles behind a paywall and charging readers because, overwhelmingly, people will not pay for content. Whether that is good or bad is irrelevant. Internet readers simply do not pay for content in numbers large enough to make charging readers to read a viable business model.\n\nSo, ruling out charging readers to read means that we must monetize IPWatchdog.com in other ways. And over the years we have increasingly moved to monetize through sponsored webinars, in-person programs, banner ads and podcast sponsorships.\n\nWhy the Change?\n\nIncreasingly, as more publications charge fees to publish, require assignment of the underlying copyright, and place content behind a paywall, we are receiving more (and numerous) requests to publish on our platform. And the increase has largely come from attorneys at large firms who never (or only rarely) financially support us. Ironically, the pitches we receive typically come from an outside PR firm who is being paid to get us to publish articles for free. So, it has been hard not to notice that these firms never support us financially, they do support others financially, and—instead of supporting us—they are paying PR people to get us to publish for free. Clearly, we are doing something wrong and need to course correct.\n\nWho is Eligible to Publish on IPWatchdog.com\n\nMoving forward, we will only allow law firms and service providers who financially support IPWatchdog to write for our platform. Specifically, we will only publish articles from those who have financially supported IPWatchdog in some way within the last 12 months. This financial support can be through some combination of sponsoring webinars, sponsoring in-person programs, buying banner ads and/or sponsoring our podcast. As a small business ourselves, we understand that it is unrealistic and inappropriate to have bright-line expectations that equally apply to big and small firms. We will not expect the same level of support from solo practitioners and small firms as we will require from larger firms.\n\nAny articles submitted by law firms and service providers must still satisfy our other publication criteria, including being primarily non-commercial in nature. And this new policy does not apply to in-house attorneys, industry thought leaders, newsmakers, such as current and former government officials and judges, who are welcome to continue publishing on IPWatchdog.com.\n\nSupport IPWatchdog and Join the Community\n\nIn short, if you want to build a reputation as an authority and you want people to actually find and read your articles, you need to be publishing with IPWatchdog.com! After all, it takes the same amount of time to write an article that no one will find and read, so why not publish with IPWatchdog.com instead?\n\nSupport us and become a member of the IPWatchdog community. From a business development perspective, I assure you it will be the best decision you and your firm have ever made.\n\nIf you have interest in supporting IPWatchdog, please contact us using this form.\n\nImage Source: Deposit Photos\n\nAuthor: alexmillos\n\nImage ID: 29893499"}
