The bill authorizes the creation of a bipartisan commission to pave a path for several Illinois counties to join Indiana, pending the passage of similar legislation in Illinois and, ultimately, federal approval. \nBut a corresponding bill in neighboring Illinois, House Bill 1500, remains stuck in committee, and there is ample reason to be skeptical about any change to state borders taking place. Yet, the issues raised by the proposed move speak to the difficult balance between promoting national unity and recognizing local distinctiveness.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThe idea of counties leaving a state is not as eccentric as it may seem. In fact, it has happened several times in American history resulting in the states of Vermont, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Maine. And at various times, counties in Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri experienced cross-border movement. The idea may be gaining traction once again, as illustrated by the Indiana-Illinois proposal and the Greater Idaho movement, which hopes to see much of eastern Oregon join Idaho.\nPerhaps the best example of the local appeal—and national dangers—of the practice comes from Maine’s journey to statehood. This history highlights why local voters pursue such solutions, along with the unintended national consequences which can arise as a result of these goals being realized.\nWhile Maine’s statehood is often remembered only in the context of the Missouri Compromise, it was also the culmination of decades of growing political and cultural divides between Maine and Massachusetts. \nRead More: Now You Know: Why Are There Two Dakotas?\nMaine was originally part of Massachusetts. Following the American Revolution, many in Maine began to express resentment about how the state legislature in far-off Boston administered the District of Maine, likening their situation to that of the American colonies before the Revolution. They complained about the sale of massive tracts of land to speculators, driving up the cost of land for would-be settlers. They chaffed under taxes and regulations that were better suited to the economic realities of Massachusetts than Maine, where prices were already higher, foodstuffs and currency more scarce, and farmers more dependent on the seasonal export of timber than in the rest of the state. At the same time, Mainers emphasized their hardiness in coping with the harsher winters they endured and their distinct history. They celebrated and mourned the facts that Maine had been a separate colony from Massachusetts until the 1670s and the site of many of the most intense battles between English, French, and Indigenous forces during the early 1700s.\nPerhaps most frustrating to Mainers: the domineering influence of Boston in the state’s government. They also complained that the distance from any part of Maine to Boston made it an “inconvenience” to participate in the state’s legislature, or to access government records and services.\nBetween the 1780s and the 1810s, there was only very slow progress toward Maine separating from Massachusetts. The Massachusetts legislature was not completely inattentive during this time, creating new district courts in Maine and allowing the counties in Maine to vote on the issue several times, with each successive occasion garnering a greater portion of the vote. Mainers, both in favor and in opposition to separation, were also active in rallying support during these years, publishing countless newspaper articles and pamphlets on the subject, as well as holding several separation conventions in Portland and Brunswick.\nPro-separation writers tended to emphasize the distinctiveness of Maine and the need for a smaller legislature, composed of men who understood the local environment and economic conditions, and who could effectively legislate on behalf of Mainers. They argued that if smaller states like Vermont and New Hampshire could govern themselves, so too could Maine. That was especially true because Massachusetts, they contended, had a history of vacillating between mismanaging and neglecting Maine, as seen in the War of 1812, when the state government did not send the militia to oust the British from occupied Castine and Eastport. \nAnti-separation arguments tended to focus on the stability that remaining a part of Massachusetts offered, the larger population and economic potential of the two together, and the hopes (at least before the War of 1812) that Massachusetts would be a powerful ally in the event of a British invasion from New Brunswick.\nMeanwhile, a small group of Mainers, especially in York County (west of Portland, and the location of the Portsmouth naval yard, in Kittery), favored joining New Hampshire, instead of becoming part of a new state. They had different aims from those wanting independence, but they shared the desire to be a part of a state that reflected their own political values and to which they were economically tied.  \nIn both 1816 and 1819, the start of the Massachusetts legislative session was met with a flurry of petitions from Maine towns requesting the opportunity to vote on separation. Signed by thousands, these petitions revealed the rising popularity of the idea. \nIn these petitions, separatists provided numerous reasons why Maine should break off from Massachusetts. One, from the town of Hallowell, argued “the resources and extensive territory of Maine could be best called forth and improved by a local government.” They also claimed that education, so essential “to preserve the political virtue of our free and invaluable institutions,” could be better supported by a separate state of Maine.\nAn 1816 vote was mired in controversy, but finally, on July 26, 1819, Mainers conclusively voted to separate from Massachusetts, with 17,091 favoring and 7,132 opposing separation. In October, a constitutional convention was held in Portland and Maine’s provisional legislature petitioned Congress for statehood in January 1820. All indications suggested a rapid admission into the Union.\nRead More: America's Rural Hospital Crisis Has Been Looming for Decades\nBut then a roadblock emerged: at the time, the U.S. had an equal number of free and slave states. Politicians from slave-holding states feared that rapid growth in the number of states that outlawed slavery would eventually lead to a national ban. As such, they threatened to block Maine’s statehood (just as anti-slavery Congressmen threatened to block statehood for Missouri).\nIn an effort to maintain the status-quo, members on both sides agreed to the Missouri Compromise: Maine would enter the Union as a free state, while Missouri would enter as a slave state. Additionally, no new slave states would be created north of the 36°30′ line of latitude. While Mainers got what they wanted, the Missouri Compromise merely postponed the battle over slavery. Subsequent compromises delayed the battle further, but eventually such efforts failed to prevent the outbreak of the Civil War.  \nWhen seen through this lens, Maine’s separation from Massachusetts speaks to both the spirit of community and of legislators listening to their constituents, which, at its best, makes American representative democracy work. Yet, the tie to the Missouri Compromise speaks to the dangers of geographic factionalism as well.  \nThe Illinois residents who want to separate from Illinois share some of the complaints voiced by Mainers in the 19th century. They assert that Chicago dominates Illinois politics, and the state government does not represent them well. The Maine case illustrates that their desire to be governed by likeminded legislators and to live in a more homogenous political community is far from new. \nYet, the role of Maine’s separation in the sectional politics of the U.S. also offers a cautionary note. No one can argue that Maine’s statehood, or even the Missouri Compromise itself, was the singular or direct cause of the Civil War. It nonetheless hardened deepening partisan and geographic divisions in the U.S. \nThe absorption of some of Illinois’ most strongly Republican counties into already solidly Republican Indiana, strengthening Democratic control of Illinois in the process, would similarly risk writing partisan and ideological divisions into state borders. \nIf successful, Illinois residents leaving the Prairie State for another state, or forming a new one of their own, might feel like such a move gives them more of a voice in their own governance. Yet, the eventual outcome of the geographic tensions could deepen our already hardened partisan divides and reawaken the long-dormant precedent of writing political divisions into our maps. Redrawing the borders of Illinois, as Indiana legislators are proposing to do, might create fault lines that could one day prove rapturous.\nConor William Howard is a PhD candidate at Indiana University, Bloomington.

Iâve seen both Steve and Mark talk about things in their chats they feel are playing it safe and then be wrong time and time again. The new torpedo bats being a recent examples. Both Mark and Steve said theyâre being overblown and not a big deal but then the rest of mlb jumped on the bandwagon because any small advantage adds up over 162 and this is a copycat league (something Nick mentioned in his last chat). Thatâs an intelligent take instead of referring to some overreactions on twitter.

Artificial intelligence (AI) finds insights from across the web, whether you want basic tips or need to research for your college thesis—and these are the best AI research tools you can use to do it.\nPerplexity is one of the best AI tools if you want software resembling a search engine. Each time you look up a topic, you'll get comprehensive reasoning and a list of resources from which the information was pulled. The app will then provide a summary of your response and follow-up questions with which you can deepen your research if needed.\nWhile its basic tools are some of the best, Perplexity doesn't stop there. With the Deep Research feature, you'll first get initial information about your query. Then, the app will dig deeper to find all the statistics and citations you need. Once it has done that, you'll see everything in three tabs:\nFrom personal experience, I found Perplexity's Deep Research tool to be significantly more comprehensive than Copilot and ChatGPT (though you should still consider getting Perplexity Pro and ChatGPT Plus subscriptions. Perplexity, in general, is so good that it has even made AI doubters change their minds; besides browsing articles, you also get images and videos related to your searches.\nPerplexity is available as a web app; the desktop app offers no extra benefits, so I recommend using it in your browser from a computer. Alternatively, you can get the app on iOS and Android.\nDownload: Perplexity for iOS | Android (Free, in-app purchases available)\nYou can use ChatGPT Deep Research in numerous ways, such as discovering statistics and finding sources for your big research projects. It's an excellent companion for students and academics, and you'll find similar uses if you want to research for your job. At the time of writing in April 2025, the software is available to ChatGPT Plus and PRO users.\nWhile searching the web, ChatGPT provides live updates. You'll discover what the software has found throughout the research process, which helps you get a better overall picture. This feature is particularly useful considering ChatGPT usually takes at least 3-5 minutes to gather its research and bring everything together in the app.\nAfter compiling its research, ChatGPT's Deep Research tool gives you a full analysis. You'll see the sources used for each point, allowing you to click through and do more research if needed. You get access to a limited number of monthly Deep Research credits if you have a premium subscription.\nDownload: ChatGPT for iOS | Android (Free, in-app purchases available)\nWhile Copilot's Deep Research tool isn't on the same level as ChatGPT or Perplexity, the basic version holds its own against these two tools. Copilot is great at visualizing data and making it easier to digest. For example, its mind-map graphics generally have fewer glitches than the likes of ChatGPT.\nCopilot is similarly excellent at generating tables. You can use this feature to compare different products you want to buy, and it's equally useful for highlighting key statistics or talking points from your research projects.\nTo use Copilot, you can sign in with a Microsoft or personal GitHub account. The basic version is free, but you can subscribe for $20/mo. Before paying the monthly fee, you can get a 30-day free trial.\nDownload: Copilot for iOS | Android (Free, in-app purchases available)\niAsk lets you filter your prompts and get more accurate responses via:\nWhen using this tool, you can use iAsk in your search engine by downloading the extension for Google Chrome. If you don't want to use this, you can ask questions within the web app. iAsk lets you research in Incognito Mode if you don't want to save your history, and you don't need an account to use the tool.\nYou'll get results pulled from online articles, social media, and other places when you receive your answers, with a mixture of text, videos, and images. If you need more information, you can use the Elaborate tool. Otherwise, going deeper is possible with the Related Questions tab or by asking a follow-up.\nIf the response you get is too confusing, you can use the Simplify feature instead.\nDownload: iAsk for iOS (Free, in-app purchases available)\nIf you're looking to enhance your academic research with AI, LitMaps might be what you're looking for. The tool is designed specifically for scientific research, making it perfect for your next research paper or your big thesis. To ensure your results are more accurate, you can see which papers do not have enough citations.\nOnce you choose a research paper, LitMaps will provide a list of similar papers. Once you have a list, you get a summary of each research paper when clicking on it. Filter by date and journal title to get more accurate results.\nWhile you should still read the research papers to get a full overview, LitMaps is ideal if you want a starting point. With the summary information, you can then determine if a paper is worth reading further.\nWhether completing research for personal, professional, or academic reasons, these AI research tools will help you fulfill your goals. Many are free to use at a base level, though you'll need a paid subscription to unlock some features. When cross-referencing with search results in Google, you'll build a powerful strategy to research more effectively.\nWe want to hear from you!

I have used their earlier version, but I understand they have now incorporated a search function. The search function is supposed to search for the sources, from which we can then select the ones we want.

Fast forward nearly two months, and many of those questions remain.\nIt will take some time for both divisions to reset following Topuria's bombshell decision. At lightweight, the million-dollar question is whether Topuria will get an immediate title shot or have to earn one by facing another lightweight contender. Topuria claimed at a news conference last month that the UFC promised him his next bout would be for a title, but the UFC has not yet announced Topuria's next fight nor the next title matchup for its lightweight champion, Islam Makhachev.\nFormer lightweight champion Charles Oliveira is in the running for a shot against Makhachev. As is former interim champion Justin Gaethje. Arman Tsarukyan, who withdrew the day before his January fight at UFC 311 with Makhachev because of back spasms, is still in play. On top of that, Makhachev reportedly has aspirations of moving up to welterweight, either in the immediate future or somewhere down the road.\nAs UFC CEO Dana White said of the situation at a recent news conference, \"A lot of s--- going on right now ...\"\nLuckily, we are about to get answers at featherweight. Former champion Alexander Volkanovski faces Diego Lopes for the 145-pound championship at UFC 314 on Saturday night in Miami (ESPN+ PPV, 10 ET, with prelims on ESPN/ESPN+/Disney+ at 8 ET), and that's just one of several featherweight bouts on the card. Topuria's departure threw both divisions into a bit of chaos, but at least at featherweight, we know the questions and when they'll be answered.\nVolkanovski went from one of the surest bets in MMA to a mountain of question marks within two years. He is only 36 years old and nearly beat Makhachev in a lightweight title fight in 2023, but he has also been knocked out in back-to-back appearances and has revealed he's been working on his mental health.\nAhead of this matchup against Lopes, 30, Volkanovski's back is against the wall. His fans might be worried about another loss and about his health. This is the most doubt Volkanovski has faced in his 14-year UFC career. He told ESPN he stopped drinking alcohol well before the start of this camp and has been ahead of schedule with his weight cut. His confidence certainly appears to be intact.\n\"I want to prove I can beat this new school [of fighters],\" Volkanovski said. \"I still got these guys, trust me. Lopes is young, hungry, on a tear at the moment. [I want] to go out and do that and [have fans] be like, 'Oh wow, Volk's still got it.'\"\nSorting out this 145-pound division starts with Volkanovski. He was the king until he ran into Topuria. Now that Topuria is moving on, who's to say that the throne shouldn't still belong to Volkanovski? To get there, he has to overcome a tough historical trend: Fighters 35 and older are 0-17 in UFC title fights at 155 pounds and lighter.\nThe best fighter in the world at any weight class is often the UFC champion. The UFC has the top talent and the deepest weight classes. Occasionally, however, there is a debate -- and for years, a potential one has involved Pitbull.\nPitbull was a long-reigning featherweight champion in Bellator MMA, and he also won its lightweight title in 2019 by knocking out Michael Chandler, who will take on Paddy Pimblett in the co-main event of UFC 314. Any longtime MMA fan would have loved to see Volkanovski fight Pitbull during their respective reigns in the UFC and Bellator. That's why it was no surprise that Pitbull's first social media post upon securing his release from Bellator earlier this year was, \"Hi, @alexvolkanovski.\"\nPitbull faces Yair Rodriguez on Saturday. If he wins impressively, there's a very good chance he catapults himself to the top of the rankings and a title shot.\nHe is 37, though, and was knocked out for the first time in 2023 by Chihiro Suzuki at Super Rizin 2. Like Volkanovski, Pitbull is at a unique point in his career where he has something to prove. But if he can prove it, he can jump the line. And that line isn't even super long. It basically comes down to one other contender ...\nThat contender is Evloev, who is 19-0 overall and 9-0 in the UFC, including a unanimous decision over Lopes two years ago. In fact, each of the wrestling-heavy Evloev's wins in the UFC has come by decision.\nHere's a good way to sum up Evloev's standing in the UFC: White referred to his win over Arnold Allen in January 2024 as \"the least fun fight anybody's ever seen.\" Movsar has since stated he won't beg White for a title shot and will run his record to 100-0 if that's what it takes to win a championship. You get the picture.\nVolkanovski and Lopes have both said they want to fight Evloev, and the UFC can't deny him forever. His path already has been long, but for it to culminate in a title opportunity, nothing short of perfection is required.\nPico is headed to the UFC. It hasn't been officially announced, but the news has been coming and the biggest hurdles have been cleared.\nPico, 28, signed with Bellator back in 2014, three years before he even made his MMA debut. The young freestyle wrestling phenom was one of the most promising prospects in MMA history but lost three of his first seven Bellator fights. Since the rough start, he has won nine of 10 and was in line to fight for the Bellator title before the promotion ceased operations this year.\nEight years and 17 fights into his professional career, Pico's true ceiling remains a mystery. He has all of the talent in the world, but a move to the UFC will be a step up in competition. If he does prove to be championship-caliber, his stock could go through the roof. You want to talk about a shakeup in this division? Pico's move to the UFC could be the biggest wild card of the year.\nJean Silva has been thrown an opportunity to face Bryce Mitchell at UFC 314 in an extremely quick turnaround from his first-round knockout of Melsik Baghdasaryan in February. Youssef Zalal, who is on his second run in the UFC after getting cut in 2021, is finding his stride, too. He just beat the always-game Calvin Kattar in February to get to 4-0 since he reentered the UFC a year ago.\nLastly, Lerone Murphy is undefeated and will be ranked among the top 10 following Saturday's main event win against Josh Emmett. There's not a lot of flash to Murphy, who is quietly on an eight-fight win streak, but there appears to be more than enough substance to create some issues for the top of the division."}

Discover is a good source for getting the latest articles, videos, and other personalized content delivered to you, and chances are that you’d like the content and want to share it with friends and family. Google is changing how Discover content is shared on the internet, and some users may find this change unnecessary and possibly irksome.\nPreviously, when you shared content you spotted on Google Discover (whether from the minus-one screen or within the Google app itself), it was shared as an ordinary URL. Users who saw the URL would recognize the website if they were familiar with it. Social media websites and instant messaging apps would also generate rich preview cards from this URL (like showing the meta description and featured image) if the website followed standard web practices.\nGoogle has been experimenting with inserting its own link shortener whenever you share content you spotted in Discover.\nThese shortened URLs take the form of search.app and share.google links, both of which are Google-owned domains. This change has been around for a bit but is now rolling out to more users.\nThe shortened URLs obfuscate what website others will be clicking on. However, Google is solving this by presenting a verbose share message that does mention the website’s name of the website, but as standard text that you can easily modify or delete. Thankfully, it does seem that Google has preserved metadata, as we’ve seen rich previews on WhatsApp when sharing these shortened URLs.\nLink shortening is a fairly common practice. Sometimes, it is helpful, like if you have a lengthy URL that a customer needs to type out. But in most instances, it doesn’t serve a purpose other than collecting analytics data on clicks.

The panic comes as Trump’s officials have worked to deport foreign nationals accused of supporting terrorist groups or putting U.S. foreign policy at risk, citing federal law.\nThe trepidation around anti-Israel advocacy stands in contrast to the years of Joe Biden’s presidency, when activists frequently made national news at colleges by illegally taking over campus facilities in large numbers or espousing violent rhetoric against Israel and Jews.\nThe first highly publicized example of the Trump administration’s crackdown was its arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, who helped lead a pro-Hamas encampment at Columbia University that cost the school millions of dollars in federal funding. Lawyers are fighting in court to keep the government from deporting him on the basis of national security. (RELATED: Legal Group Defending Anti-Israel Activist Previously Warned Protesters Like Him Could Be Deported)\nThe free speech advocacy group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), which has criticized Trump’s approach, questioned the sincerity of universities’ sudden support for pro-Palestinian expression since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 attacks.\n“If this is what it takes for colleges to start taking the First Amendment and free expression seriously, we’ll take it. But we’re not holding our breath,” said FIRE Campus Advocacy Director Lindsie Rank.\n“At the same time universities are issuing statements in support of free speech, we’re also seeing rampant censorship of pro-Palestinian expression by college administrations,” Rank told the DCNF. “And we’re hearing from Jewish and pro-Israel students who feel chilled in expressing their views.”\n“Meanwhile, we’re still handling plenty of our ‘usual’ cases that have nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — things like student groups unable to table, student newspapers facing administrative pressure, and speakers being disinvited,” Rank said.\nThe University of Virginia (UVA) privately advised a student editor on a visa that articles linked to him or her could risk immigration status, according to the Guardian. This reportedly led the student to resign from the student paper. That paper told the outlet that the articles were “about Trump’s policies on universities, specifically regarding immigrants and pro-Palestine activism.”\nUVA has also released statements saying it will support foreign students in navigating visa difficulties and that it stands for free speech, though the statements did not criticize Trump’s policies. UVA’s media team did not respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\nIt is a privilege to be granted a visa to live & study in the United States of America.\nWhen you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country.\nI’m glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers… pic.twitter.com/jR2uVVKGCM\n— Secretary Kristi Noem (@Sec_Noem) March 14, 2025 \nImmigration experts previously told the DCNF that deporting migrants over their foreign policy stances is not a free speech issue and that the government historically has had broad authority to do so. The Trump administration shows no signs of stopping.\n“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in March. “When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.”\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\t\t\t\t\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n\t\t\t\t\thands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\t\t\t\t\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n\t\t\t\t\tOur original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n\t\t\t\t\tthem -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\t\t\t\t\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n\t\t\t\t\tour being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.\n\t\t\t\t\nHelp us save her.\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have \n\t\t\t\t\ttrained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily \n\t\t\t\t\tCaller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n\t\t\t\t\tNewsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\t\t\t\t\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n\t\t\t\t\tfair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\t\t\t\t\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n\t\t\t\t\tto ignore.\n\t\t\t\t\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — \n\t\t\t\t\tthe everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.\n\t\t\t\t\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n\t\t\t\t\tcorporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new \n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there \n\t\t\t\t\tare millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.\n\t\t\t\t\nIn return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that \n\t\t\t\t\twe have long used to support our mission.

It felt like I had lost the gear for it.\nWe talk a lot about strength and muscle gain here on AoM. If youâre looking to get bigger and stronger, youâll find plenty of articles on those topics.\nBut an area of fitness that weâve overlooked, but Iâm now starting to appreciate more and more as I move into middle age, is muscle power.\nWhat I was experiencing in my basketball match-ups against Gus was a diminishment in this capacity.\nResearchers have given the age-related loss of muscle power a name: powerpenia. And growing research shows that itâs a key predictor of whether youâll be able to pick up your grandkid, climb a flight of stairs, or hoist your keister off the toilet when you’re 70.\nHereâs what you need to know about powerpenia â and how to resist it.\nYouâve likely heard of sarcopenia â the loss of muscle mass with age. It typically begins around age 40 and accelerates after age 60. Muscle mass typically declines by .5-1% per year after 40. Sarcopenia leads to frailty in old age, which makes it hard for old people to get out of chairs, let alone get up from the floor if they fall down.\nThen thereâs dynapenia â the loss of muscle strength. Sarcopenia contributes to dynapenia, but there are also other things going on that lead to age-related declines in muscle strength. Mostly it comes down to our neuro-muscular system becoming less efficient at activating our muscles. Muscle strength declines along a similar trajectory as muscle mass, with a loss of 0.5â1% per year after age 40.\nBoth sarcopenia and dynapenia can be mitigated and even reversed with regular strength training, which is why weâre big fans of weightlifting.\nIn 2024, researchers introduced a third area of concern: powerpenia â the loss of muscle power.\nMuscle power is the ability to display strength quickly; itâs explosiveness. Examples of muscle power in action include jumping for a rebound, sprinting, and punching. But muscle power doesnât just come in handy in sports. Muscle power is also what lets you:\nPowerpenia may be the new age-related muscle concern on the block, but it seems to be the most influential factor in the maintenance of our physical vitality. In fact, a recent study found that power â not strength â is the best predictor of whether older people are able to successfully navigate the activities of daily living.\nThe interesting thing about muscle power is that it actually drops faster than muscle size and strength â as much as 2â4% per year after 40. That means by your 60s or 70s, you might still look pretty solid and even test decently on a strength test, but youâve lost the explosiveness needed to stay agile and independent.\nWhy the rapid decline? Three big reasons:\nFirst, thereâs the loss of fast-twitch muscle fibers. Fast-twitch fibers are responsible for generating quick bursts of strength and speed, and they naturally atrophy faster than slow-twitch fibers as we age and donât call upon them.\nSecond, there are the changes in our tendons due to inactivity. If you donât regularly do activities that require you to display strength quickly, your tendons become stiff and less efficient at storing and releasing energy, making explosive movements harder to perform. The degradation of tendon health from disuse explains why a lot of middle-aged guys injure themselves when they decide to play pick-up basketball for the first time in a decade. Itâs why I got a bad case of hamstring tendonitis a few years ago when I decided to do a sprint workout after years of not sprinting.\nFinally, as we age and donât call upon our fast-twitch muscles for explosive activity, our brain and nervous system become less efficient at telling our muscles to contract quickly.\nAfter my lackluster performance in basketball games against Gus and after reading the research on powerpenia, I decided I needed to do something to counteract the decline of muscle power that comes with middle age.\nFortunately, itâs not that hard to do.\nHere are some things Iâve started to incorporate into my physical training to fend off powerpenia:\nPlyometric exercises develop explosive power by training your muscles and nervous system to react quickly.\nYou donât have to devote an entire workout to plyos. You can add one or two plyometric exercises to your regular strength-training routines. Hereâs what Iâm doing:\nBefore my first lower-body workout of the week, I do the following plyometric exercises:\nBefore my second lower-body workout of the week, I do the following plyos:\nBefore my first upper-body workout of the week, I do the following plyometric exercise:\nBefore my second upper-body workout of the week, I do the following plyometric exercise:\nAs I continue with these plyos, Iâll probably rotate some of them out and substitute some of the plyometric exercises weâve written about here into my routine.  \nHill sprints are one of the most potent weapons against power loss. They engage fast-twitch fibers better than flat-surface sprints while also reducing impact on your muscles and tendons, thus reducing the likelihood of injuries. Besides training for power, hill sprints are a great HIIT exercise.\nFind a 20â30-yard hill. After a warm-up, do 4â6 sprints up the hill at 80â90% effort. Walk down slowly to recover. Rest 1â2 minutes between sprints. You just need to do this once a week.\nFor more tips on doing safe and effective sprints in general, read our Grown-Upâs Guide to Sprinting.\nIf you’re looking for another powerpenia-fighting cardio/HIIT exercise, jump roping is a great one. We’ve got a whole guide to that, too.\nIf it’s been a long time since you did the kind of explosive exercises outlined above, you may be concerned that trying them will get you injured. Start slowly and gently, to be sure. Doing things like stepping down from the box after your box jumps and sprinting uphill will help lessen the risk of injuries. And you can do things like broad jumps and hill sprints on softer surfaces like grass.\nBut you do need to steadily ease into these movements to avoid a kind of catch-22: avoid plyometric exercises out of fear of injury, and you actually increase the risk of injury when life suddenly demands an explosive movement.\nThe only way to safely rebuild this capacity is to train it â gradually and consistently. And once you have it back, donât stop. Keep training these movements into old age, until the day youâre truly no longer capable of doing them.\nIâve been doing these power exercises for about a month now, and Iâm already noticing a difference.\nIâm still not as explosive as my teenage son, but I can better shift myself into that gear when we face off on the driveway court.\nAnd knowing that training for power will keep me strong and capable as I age â not just in the game, but in life â is the real win.\n\nNever miss an update\nSubscribe to the AoM Newsletter\nWant to start taking action on the content you read on AoM?\nNever miss an update\nSubscribe to the AoM Newsletter\nView all          \nRelated\nArticles///\nView all          \nThe Art of Manliness participates in affiliate marketing programs, which means we get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links.

This time, the company has imposed an update block on devices that use an incompatible driver called sprotect.sys from SenseShield Technology, which is causing serious problems for users after the latest update.\nAccording to Microsoft, the driver “provides encryption protection and is used by specialized security software and enterprise solutions” and “can be automatically introduced into a system as part of the installation process of many different applications” (e.g., antivirus software).\nIn serious cases, the compatibility problems caused by the latest Windows 11 24H2 update can lead to an increase in blue screen errors or black screen crashes.

System administrators should check whether these drivers have been installed on devices. As already mentioned, these drivers can be installed and updated by various applications, and there’s no comprehensive overview at this time.\nTo prevent the error on affected devices, Microsoft has instated an update block with ID number 56318982. Affected systems are no longer eligible to receive an update to Windows 11 24H2 via Windows Update.\nMicrosoft is working together with SenseShield Technology on a solution so that the problems can be resolved soon and that affected users get the update once more.

That’s why the idea of a dashcam app for Android Auto is so appealing, but while Google built such an app for Android Automotive, there’s no sign of it coming to the phone-based platform.\nAn “Integrate Dashcam” page on Google’s website for Android developers was surfaced by Android Authority last week, with the page detailing a “dashcam app” built for Android Automotive. The app, Google explains, would allow vehicles with Android Automotive (AAOS) to offer this functionality to drivers.\nThe Dashcam app is designed to integrate with AAOS, providing drivers with video recording capabilities for enhanced safety and security. This guide outlines the technical requirements, integration steps, and best practices to ensure a successful implementation.\nThe app isn’t available for download, but Google’s guide details the recommendations for how an automaker should implement the functionality. The report which first surfaced this app also rightly points out that one reason why this app doesn’t appear to be in use is due to various technical and legal concerns that would come from building this functionality directly into the vehicle itself.\nImportantly, though, this dashcam app has absolutely nothing to do with Android Auto.\nIn the days since this app first surfaced, we’ve noticed other publications irresponsibly running articles that Google made a dashcam app “for Android Auto” and that an “Android Auto update” adds support for a dashcam.\nIn no way, shape, or form has Google said this, nor has any reporting on the topic suggested may be the case.\nRather, these articles are effectively spreading misinformation, taking advantage of Google’s messy branding of these platforms to garner additional attention. While Google briefly called both of these platforms “Android Auto,” this has not been the case for years, with the native OS currently being referred to as “Android Automotive,” “AAOS,” or “Google built-in.” \nFollow Ben: Twitter/X, Threads, Bluesky, and Instagram\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

For more information, click here.\nMemphis got the hard part out of the way on Thursday by finally winning its first game under Tuomas Iisalo, with Morant nailing a buzzer-beater to cap a 30-point performance at the Miami Heat. With so little time left in the regular season, the Grizzlies now need to home in on the elements of Iisalo's system that best position the team for success in the playoffs. It's clear Iisalo wants to feature Morant more on the offensive end, but the Grizz need to find a way to do it while also optimizing Jaren Jackson Jr. and Desmond Bane. Expectations for the postseason appear to be low internally, with general manager Zach Kleiman saying he is looking for \"clarity of direction\" under Iisalo. But if Memphis finds a way to surprise in the playoffs, it could go a long way in stabilizing a shaky situation between the team and Morant caused by the abrupt firing of Taylor Jenkins.  -- Michael C. Wright\nThe Denver Nuggets, the last Western team to win the NBA title (2023), are the most likely to pull off an upset against an Oklahoma City squad that will end up with the best point differential in league history. Nikola Jokic presents a massive matchup problem for anyone, even a team that can play a pair of 7-foot rim protectors together in Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein. Jokic offered a resounding reminder of that in Oklahoma City on March 10, when he registered 35 points, 18 rebounds and 8 assists in a win that was aided by Jamal Murray's 34 points to secure a 2-2 split in the regular-season series. The Nuggets will need that kind of production from their No. 2 option to get through Oklahoma City, which will be quite a challenge with Murray's Team Canada teammate Lu Dort leading the Thunder's top-ranked defense.  -- Tim MacMahon\nWhat's worse than being a second apron team? Being one that missed the playoffs with a $400 million payroll, including luxury taxes. What's worse than that? Having the player you need to trade in Bradley Beal own a no-trade clause and giving on-the-record quotes about holding all the cards. OK, one more question: Do the Suns want to trade Kevin Durant this summer? No, not really. But the reality is that the Suns' pathways of getting out of the second apron -- to ensure they have flexibility -- all seem to lead to Durant. They can't trade Beal and won't trade Devin Booker. That is why at the trade deadline the Suns held talks with a handful of teams about Durant trades, conversations that are likely to lead to action this summer. One of the reasons there wasn't a Durant trade in February -- other than Durant himself making it clear he didn't want one -- is the Suns were looking for a massive haul in return, per sources.\nRegardless of how much Durant has left in the tank, that might not be in the cards. Durant will be 37 years old at the start of next season, and while he's absolutely still worth the $55 million he will earn next season, the two-year, $120 million max extension he may be looking for might not attract suitors. Teams that will want Durant will be title contenders who generally have high payrolls already. If the Suns arrive at a crossroads where they have to move Durant, they might have to make a decision between getting what they want, which is a beautiful package of players and draft capital, and settling for what they need, which is flexibility. Last summer, for example, the Clippers chose flexibility over all else when letting Paul George leave. It was a hard decision, but it has changed their entire horizon. The Suns might end up studying that decision closely. -- Brian Windhorst\n• Fantasy basketball 101: How to play\n• 10 tips to win your league\n• Projections | Top 150 rankings\n• Experts: Our five favorite draft targets\n• Mock draft: 10-team H2H points league\nSign up for free today!\nAn accommodating draw. With a handful of games left in the regular season, L.A. could feasibly finish anywhere from No. 3 to No. 8 in the West. Avoiding the play-in tournament and securing the No. 6 spot or better would give the Lakers a week to prepare for the playoffs and afford some time for a few of their banged-up players (LeBron James, Luka Doncic and Rui Hachimura topping that list) to heal. If they can finish No. 4 or better, they would begin by hosting their first-round series at Crypto.com Arena, where they have the second-best home record in the West. \"We would like to be in the top four,\" coach JJ Redick said Thursday. \"We'd like to have home court [advantage]. I think beyond just playing well at home, it would be nice for our guys to finish [the regular season] in Portland and then be able to be home for nine or 10 days.\" Of the teams below them, the Grizzlies would be the preferred matchup considering L.A.'s playoff success against them in 2023 and its 3-1 mark to win the regular-season series. Then again, facing a team such as Denver early for a chance to avenge previous playoff series against the Nuggets could provide a boost. Or playing the Clippers and not having to travel at all -- and seeing Laker Nation storm the gates of the Intuit Dome for \"road\" games -- could be a beneficial series to start things off. If the Lakers can finish No. 3 and avoid a showdown with Oklahoma City until the conference finals, they'd potentially be trying to take down the West's No. 1 seed after already having played high-level hoops for a month straight, with their belief factor growing the entire time. -- Dave McMenamin\nOklahoma City. It would be devastating for the Warriors, after spending much of the past two months chasing down and then holding on to the sixth spot, to fall into the play-in tourney in the final week of the regular season. If the Warriors drop below sixth, they would lose a valuable week off before the first round and have to battle in the play-in. Stephen Curry (age 37), Draymond Green (35) and Jimmy Butler III (35) could then potentially face a young and athletic Thunder squad. The Warriors believe they can go up against any opponent given the championship pedigree of Curry, Green and Steve Kerr not to mention the addition of \"Playoff Jimmy.\" But despite being 2-1 against the Thunder before the Butler trade, facing Oklahoma would be a difficult matchup.\nOn top of finding a way to contain MVP favorite Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Warriors would have to deal with emerging stars Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. With one of the top defenses in the league, the Thunder can send multiple defenders at Curry, starting with the physical Lu Dort and Alex Caruso. And inside, Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein can give the smaller Warriors trouble. Curry told ESPN in January that he and the Warriors feel they can beat anyone in a seven-game series. Butler's arrival only enhances that confidence. But the Warriors would rather avoid the league's best team in the first round and use their time off to prepare their star players.  -- Ohm Youngmisuk\nMinnesota has maintained a top-10 defense basically all season, but the offense has leaped forward down the stretch. At the end of February, the Timberwolves ranked 13th in offensive rating. But since the start of March, they've had the third-best offense, behind only the Clippers and Boston Celtics. Much of that improvement stems from hot shooting in the backcourt: Over that stretch, Mike Conley has made an astonishing 53.2% of his 3-pointers, while Donte DiVincenzo is shooting 43% from deep. Jaden McDaniels (38.2%) and Julius Randle (36.6%) also have boosted their efficiency, surrounding Anthony Edwards with plenty of spacing.\nWe shouldn't expect Minnesota's role players to stay this hot for the rest of the season; nobody in the NBA makes 53.2% of his 3s over a long span. The Timberwolves also have benefited from a relatively easy slate of opponents during this stretch: In March, they went 10-1 against sub-.500 opponents and 3-2 versus teams with winning records. They're looking better now than how they looked for most of the campaign while struggling to incorporate Randle and DiVincenzo. -- Zach Kram\nThere's bad news for Western playoff teams hoping to get a jump on scouting their first-round opponents: With less than a week left in the regular season, nothing besides Oklahoma City finishing first is close to decided. By contrast to the Eastern Conference, where the 4-5 matchup could essentially only involve the Detroit Pistons, Indiana Pacers and Milwaukee Bucks, no single Western matchup happens in more than 27% of simulations using ESPN's Basketball Power Index.\nEven that single most likely Western series, between the Grizzlies and the Houston Rockets, might not be set until after the first night of play-in action, because Houston most likely will face the winner of the opening play-in game as the No. 2 seed.  -- Kevin Pelton"}

Here’s how to save yours", "fullContent": "When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nAbout 10 years ago, a prominent tech executive confidently informed me that computer files would become obsolete. The exec was Bret Taylor, who at the time was building a Microsoft Word alternative called Quip. (He previously oversaw the birth of Google Maps and served as Facebook’s CTO, and later became the co-CEO of Salesforce.)\nTaylor argued that Quip and other online-first services like Google Docs, Netflix, and Spotify were making file management unnecessary, and that conventional file formats like .DOC or .MP3 would eventually seem as antiquated as the floppy disk.\nHis prediction has, in many ways, proven accurate. File management is now a foreign concept to an entire generation of young tech users, and you have to be a special kind of nerdy to consume media without relying on streaming services. If someone emails you a Word document, you might be more annoyed than if they’d linked to a Google Doc.\nBut I’ve always found the humble computer file to be more than just an occasional nuisance. I enjoy using apps that produce easily-accessible files on my devices, because those files are under my command and can’t be taken away. Not the case with many of the online services we rely on.\nAnd this philosophy is gaining fresh life in some tech circles as people reckon with the trade-offs of a file-free future.\nThis column first appeared in Advisorator, Jared’s weekly tech advice newsletter. Sign up to get tech advice like this every Tuesday.\nStreaming services can remove content and impose new access restrictions on a whim. Facebook and Google have locked people out of their accounts by mistake, rendering photos and communications inaccessible. Useful online resources could one day vanish from the web without warning. It’s all beyond your control.\nPreserving your own files can be a countermeasure against these kinds of scenarios. But beyond just data preservation, files provide a kind of freedom to choose the best tool for a given job.\nThese days, I do most of my writing in Obsidian, which stores documents on my computer in Markdown format. If Obsidian goes away, or if I ever just want to try a different app, I can open those files in another Markdown editor without having to convert, upload, or migrate. Same goes with photos. I automatically back up my phone’s camera roll to Google Photos, but I also keep copies in OneDrive and on my computer. That means I can try out other solutions (like the offline-first Mylio) without going through Google’s time-consuming export process.\nPerhaps best of all, a file collection says something about you. It’s an all-encompassing representation of your digital life that—unlike most things in tech—becomes more valuable with time.\nDig deep into my computer, for instance, and you’ll find a folder called “OldComputer.” This is one of my most cherished digital time capsules, a treasure trove of forgotten photos, college music projects, early web creations, and embarrassing AOL Instant Messenger chat logs that I apparently thought were worth keeping. Rifling through these old folders evokes feelings that Google Docs and Spotify can never guarantee.\nJared Newman / Foundry\nI’m not saying you need to drop all your online-first services in favor of strict file zealotry, or that you shouldn’t use cloud-based services for backup or syncing purposes. I still use all of those things because they’re useful and convenient. But if you value more control over your digital footprint, consider cultivating a file collection as part of that:\nMeanwhile, I’m glad that the idea of owning your files is gathering momentum. Obsidian CEO Steph Ango calls this philosophy “file over app” while Matt Birchler calls it “downloading the things you love“. However you label it, I think the idea is worth cherishing even if big tech execs would prefer that you didn’t.\nThis column first appeared in Advisorator, Jared’s weekly tech advice newsletter. Sign up to get tech advice like this every Tuesday.\nJared has been a freelance technology journalist for more than 15 years and is a regular contributor to PCWorld, Fast Company, and TechHive, where he's written a weekly cord-cutting column since 2014.

That’s $150 off, only a month after it launched.\nFor the full scoop on the Alienware AW2725Q, check out Matt Smith’s review on PCWorld. Long story short, it uses an eye-popping OLED panel, super-fast at 240Hz and thus suitable for intense multiplayer games, and already smaller and cheaper than many alternatives at its original $900 price. The lack of USB-C video is a bit of a bummer, especially if you’re using a gaming laptop. But considering its capabilities and value, it’s still an easy 4.5 out of 5 and an Editors’ Choice gaming monitor.\nAs usual with Dell’s Alienware monitor lines, we didn’t have to wait too long to see it discounted. Dell is currently selling it for $830 right on its own site (where you can also get a 27-inch OLED with a faster 360Hz panel but lower 1440p resolution, for just $700). Amazon’s price is even better—you could add on a VESA monitor arm to make up for the AW2725Q’s somewhat disappointing plastic stand and still be well below the going rate for a 4K OLED gaming monitor.\nAmazon doesn’t have an end date for this sale price, but you might want to get it sooner than later because consumer tech prices are expected to spike soon, especially in the US.\nSee our Best Monitor round-up for more PC monitor buying advice.\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nAbout 10 years ago, a prominent tech executive confidently informed me that computer files would become obsolete. The exec was Bret Taylor, who at the time was building a Microsoft Word alternative called Quip. (He previously oversaw the birth of Google Maps and served as Facebook’s CTO, and later became the co-CEO of Salesforce.)\nTaylor argued that Quip and other online-first services like Google Docs, Netflix, and Spotify were making file management unnecessary, and that conventional file formats like .DOC or .MP3 would eventually seem as antiquated as the floppy disk.\nHis prediction has, in many ways, proven accurate. File management is now a foreign concept to an entire generation of young tech users, and you have to be a special kind of nerdy to consume media without relying on streaming services. If someone emails you a Word document, you might be more annoyed than if they’d linked to a Google Doc.\nBut I’ve always found the humble computer file to be more than just an occasional nuisance. I enjoy using apps that produce easily-accessible files on my devices, because those files are under my command and can’t be taken away. Not the case with many of the online services we rely on.\nAnd this philosophy is gaining fresh life in some tech circles as people reckon with the trade-offs of a file-free future.\nThis column first appeared in Advisorator, Jared’s weekly tech advice newsletter. Sign up to get tech advice like this every Tuesday.\nStreaming services can remove content and impose new access restrictions on a whim. Facebook and Google have locked people out of their accounts by mistake, rendering photos and communications inaccessible. Useful online resources could one day vanish from the web without warning. It’s all beyond your control.\nPreserving your own files can be a countermeasure against these kinds of scenarios. But beyond just data preservation, files provide a kind of freedom to choose the best tool for a given job.\nThese days, I do most of my writing in Obsidian, which stores documents on my computer in Markdown format. If Obsidian goes away, or if I ever just want to try a different app, I can open those files in another Markdown editor without having to convert, upload, or migrate. Same goes with photos. I automatically back up my phone’s camera roll to Google Photos, but I also keep copies in OneDrive and on my computer. That means I can try out other solutions (like the offline-first Mylio) without going through Google’s time-consuming export process.\nPerhaps best of all, a file collection says something about you. It’s an all-encompassing representation of your digital life that—unlike most things in tech—becomes more valuable with time.\nDig deep into my computer, for instance, and you’ll find a folder called “OldComputer.” This is one of my most cherished digital time capsules, a treasure trove of forgotten photos, college music projects, early web creations, and embarrassing AOL Instant Messenger chat logs that I apparently thought were worth keeping. Rifling through these old folders evokes feelings that Google Docs and Spotify can never guarantee.\nJared Newman / Foundry\nI’m not saying you need to drop all your online-first services in favor of strict file zealotry, or that you shouldn’t use cloud-based services for backup or syncing purposes. I still use all of those things because they’re useful and convenient. But if you value more control over your digital footprint, consider cultivating a file collection as part of that:\nMeanwhile, I’m glad that the idea of owning your files is gathering momentum. Obsidian CEO Steph Ango calls this philosophy “file over app” while Matt Birchler calls it “downloading the things you love“. However you label it, I think the idea is worth cherishing even if big tech execs would prefer that you didn’t.\nThis column first appeared in Advisorator, Jared’s weekly tech advice newsletter. Sign up to get tech advice like this every Tuesday.\nJared has been a freelance technology journalist for more than 15 years and is a regular contributor to PCWorld, Fast Company, and TechHive, where he's written a weekly cord-cutting column since 2014.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nModern tech has two annoying problems: first, too much cable clutter across numerous devices; second, laptops, phones, and tablets don’t really come with charging blocks anymore. That’s why we’re big fans of multi-port wall plugs, especially when they’re built with GaN tech.\nLike this powerful 4-port Ugreen Nexode X charging block, now on sale on Amazon for just $80 (was $100). This is a special Prime-only deal, but you can still snag it at this price by simply signing up for a 30-day free trial of Prime. You’ll also get all those other Prime perks for the duration.\nThat’s a fantastic price for such a powerful model that can handle this many devices at once. With its 140W throughput, you can fast-charge your laptops, phones, earbuds, and more with minimal wait. And this thing has 3x USB-C and 1x USB-A, so it’s versatile no matter what kinds of devices and cables you have on you. But do note that when using multiple ports, the 140W total charging will get split up between ports.\nWhat’s nice is that this is a GaN charger, which is newer and more efficient tech—that means faster, smaller, and less heat given off. It’s not just great for home, but also perfect for travel thanks to its compact build and foldable prongs, which tuck in to save space and prevent damage.\nI have the non-foldable version of this and it’s easily my favorite wall plug because it’s so fast and convenient. With the foldable prongs, it’d be the ultimate travel plug. Go ahead and snag this Ugreen Nexode X on sale at Amazon while you can! And remember to sign up for a Prime trial if you aren’t a member already so you get this special price.\nGabriela has focused on tech writing for 12 years, covering news, reviews, buying guides, deals, and more.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nMicrosoft is currently developing the KB5053643 update for Windows 10, which was released on March 25 as an optional update that needs to be installed manually if you want it. Come Patch Tuesday in April, this update will be automatically deployed to all Windows 10 PCs.\nHowever, if you’re the kind of person who often needs to know the exact time down to the second, then KB5053643 could be unfavorable for you. Turns out, with this update, Microsoft is removing the clock display from the flyout menu that’s normally accessible by clicking on the time in the taskbar, reports Windows Latest.\nThis may not sound very dramatic, but it’s actually a really annoying change for anyone who regularly needs to know the exact time, whether for synchronization or programming purposes or something else.\nAfter installing KB5053643, the clock—which you can expand by clicking on the time display in the taskbar—only shows the monthly calendar and the day of the week and the current date at the top. Microsoft has completely removed the time display from the flyout menu. (Prior to the update, the time display shows accurate to the second and the day of the week and the current date are displayed below it.)\nNothing changes with the clock display right in the taskbar, but as always you only get to see the hours and minutes there.\nAccording to Windows Latest, Microsoft claims that the seconds display in the clock is a burden on the graphical user interface and causes a performance hit. Windows 10 has to spend extra resources updating the time every second, and this constant activity prevents the CPU from entering a power-saving state. This is the same reason why Windows 11 originally didn’t have a seconds display in the taskbar (but Microsoft added the seconds display back in as an option in 2023).\nWhy is Microsoft removing this feature just a few months before the end of support for Windows 10? It almost seems as if they’re deliberately making Windows 10 less attractive in order to persuade Windows 10 users to upgrade to Windows 11. No surprise given that Microsoft apparently wants you to scrap perfectly good Windows 10 PCs.\nThis article originally appeared on our sister publication PC-WELT and was translated and localized from German.\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters"}

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nCheaper Nvidia graphics cards are on the way, though exactly when they’ll arrive is still quite fuzzy. But if you prefer your PC gaming on the go, it looks like you’ll have some less-expensive RTX 50-series options soon. Several laptop makers—including Lenovo, LG, and Razer—have been spotted advertising or otherwise tipping laptop models with RTX 5060 and 5050 GPUs.\nVideoCardz.com spotted all three companies showing off the latest Nvidia laptop cards in one way or another. Lenovo has an unboxing video for the IdeaPad Pro 5, wherein the description text (not the video itself) mentions an optional RTX 5050 graphics card. Interestingly, this info appears to have been floating around for a while, with the Lenovo YouTube post marked January 30th. So unless the 4,000-view video was updated since then, Lenovo has apparently had this info floating around internally for at least a few months.\nMeanwhile, LG listed the RTX 5050 in a Taiwanese promotional page for the Gram 16 laptop, specifying that it’ll have 8GB of video memory. (That’s 2GB more than the RTX 4050 laptop card, by the way.) Finally, the latest version of Razer’s Blade 16 gaming laptop is listed with an RTX 5060 graphics card option in China, though, like the other two variants, it’s not available to order yet.\nWe’re still waiting on less-expensive desktop cards from both Nvidia and AMD, and while lower-power discrete graphics are less relevant in the current market thanks to far more capable integrated graphics, there’s still a market for them. \nIt’s possible that the chaos currently unfolding in the consumer electronics market—resulting from the Trump regime’s punishing tariffs on China, Taiwan, and several islands inhabited only by penguins—is delaying these releases as manufacturers scramble to adjust supply lines and pricing. Nintendo had to delay Switch 2 pre-orders just one day after last week’s announcement, possibly to adjust pricing for new tariffs.\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nMicrosoft unveiled a swath of new AI features during its 50th birthday bash in Redmond last week, and I got to try many of them. Copilot Vision holds the most potential for consumers, but Copilot’s shopping features aren’t far behind.\nIf you’re concerned about Copilot’s new Memory and Personality traits, I wouldn’t be — it looks way too early to get a sense of what it will eventually be. Those were my impressions after sampling most of the new Copilot demonstrations on display at Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebration. \nMicrosoft talked about its vision for a personable Copilot that could shop for you and walk you through tech issues step-by-step. Finally, Copilot is set to add some specific research tools like Deep Research, AI-generated podcasts, and Copilot Search.\nSeeing these features in action left me with some different impressions. My top three? Copilot Vision (for Windows), Copilot Shopping, and Copilot Search. As for the other features, they didn’t quite land for me.\nMicrosoft offered me the choice of several different scenarios to see a demonstration of Copilot Vision, which had impressed me with the way that it navigated through Photoshop. Seeing a gaming demo on the menu, I asked for it.\nUnfortunately, I ended up seeing a version of Minecraft being played with Copilot Vision that Microsoft had referenced before rather than something brand new like navigating through the Blender CAD app.\nMark Hachman / Foundry\nAs of now, Copilot Vision is launched via the Copilot application. Copilot “knows” what applications you’re looking at but won’t actively interpret the results until you toggle on a switch allowing it access. In this demo, Copilot Vision has the option of looking at either Minecraft or Clipchamp. We chose Minecraft.\nThe demo was pretty short. Copilot Vision looked at the contents of a chest, determined that there was some armor and emeralds inside it, and explained what they were for. Vision then looked at some vegetables and determined what they were and that they could be harvested by clicking on them.\nThe Microsoft employee opened Clipchamp and asked a question about how to facilitate transitions in a video, although she used the phrase “blend more seamlessly between all these clips.” Copilot Vision interpreted this as “seeking smoother transitions.” The employee then asked Copilot to “highlight” what to do. After a substantial pause, Copilot Vision created a halo or highlight around the proper control.\nMark Hachman / Foundry\nMicrosoft has said that Copilot Vision will be rolling out as part of the Windows Insider preview program soon, in about a week or so.\nI was more impressed than I thought I would be with Copilot’s ability to go shopping, only because Microsoft’s original documentation indicated that it would be limited to a set of specific partners. ChatGPT had announced this capability two years ago with vendors like OpenTable, but it seems like it was held up. OpenAI sort of re-announced this agentic capability in January as Operator, currently a research preview.\nCopilot’s implementation is straightforward. You just type in what you’d like and Copilot goes hunting. For now, the main screen of Copilot shows you how it’s working, with snapshots of various home pages and product pages, and a sidebar summarizing where it’s going and what it’s doing.\nMark Hachman / Foundry\nThe Shopping feature was pretty interesting to watch. The demonstrator asked for two dozen red roses from a specific site and Copilot went hunting. She then asked for a simpler, more generic request and Copilot searched multiple sites. (My question, of course, is whether Copilot will favor Microsoft’s partners.)\nShopping is also designed to perform more than one task in conjunction with one another. Want to book a trip to New York on a given date? Copilot Shopping should — if it operates as expected — be able to book a flight, knowing who’s going and what their preferences are, book a hotel for those dates, and then check for tables at restaurants, knowing how many will attend and what their preferences might be.\nMark Hachman / Foundry\nShopping is very much part of this concept of “memory” and personalization that Microsoft is trying to imbue into Copilot. It will be rolling out soon.\nCopilot Search isn’t a preview, it’s live. It’s worth trying out, too. Anthropic uses AI search; Google did, too, before it backed off.\nWhile I still think it’s worth your time to visit web pages to gather the context you’ll need, Copilot Search delivers. In part, it actually “rewrites” your search to widen the focus. For example, “What’s the best version of Windows?” could be interpreted as the “most reliable version of Windows” or the “version of Windows with the most features.” (Its answer? Windows 7, which was a bit different than my own ranking.)\nIt’s scary to see AI try to replace our expertise in real time. It’s also interesting that Microsoft doesn’t think Copilot Search is actually a Copilot feature, it’s part of Bing. I don’t know what kind of future AI search offers, but it’s an interesting way forward.\nMark Hachman / Foundry\nI’ve been deeply impressed with Google Gemini’s Deep Research, which samples from dozens of web pages and assimilates its findings. A demo of Copilot’s Deep Research doesn’t seem as in-depth?\nI didn’t get a clear sense of which sources Copilot would pull from and how many tokens and/or words would be in the final output. It’s easy for an AI to summarize its findings. It’s harder for it to present a long, well-sourced, and coherent piece of writing–that’s a sign of a superior AI output.\nThe whole concept of a “personalized AI” also took a weak swing and foul-tipped one into the mitt. I was asked to talk to Copilot about my interests (baseball pitching, in my case) and some other corollary pieces of information. I was told that Microsoft, ideally, would use that to build a profile of my likes and dislikes, also knowing that (for example) I have kids or that I’ve enjoyed my visits to the Pacific Northwest because I like cooler weather.\nBut there was no evidence of that at all, selling the whole thing on my suspension of disbelief.\nMark Hachman / Foundry\nMicrosoft did show off an AI-generated “video game,” spitting out a few frames per second, intermittently, as it generated a first-person shooter level via AI based on the PC classic Quake. Why not consider this to be one of the success stories that Microsoft showed off? Because it’s really awful save for the concept. You can try it yourself if you want. It’s just a mishmash of Quake scenery without consistency or cohesion. You’ll probably be bored within seconds.\nAI may be headed to your PC, but not everything is going to be a winner. Developers, you’ve still got jobs. \nMark has written for PCWorld for the last decade, with 30 years of experience covering technology.

At its heart lies the XNU kernel – an acronym humorously standing for “X is Not Unix.” XNU is a unique hybrid kernel that combines a Mach microkernel core with components of BSD Unix. This design inherits the rich legacy of Mach (originating from 1980s microkernel research) and the robust stability and POSIX compliance of BSD. The result is a kernel architecture that balances modularity and performance by blending microkernel message-passing techniques with a monolithic Unix kernel structure. We’ll go through a chronological exploration of Darwin and XNU’s evolution – from Mach and BSD origins to the modern kernel features in macOS on Apple Silicon and iOS on iPhones. We’ll follow this with a deep dive into the architectural milestones, analyze XNU’s internal design (Mach-BSD interaction, IPC, scheduling, memory management, virtualization), and examine how the kernel and key user-space components have adapted to new devices and requirements over time.\nDespite its popularity and open source kernel, it’s quite rare to see detailed deep-dives into the underpinnings of macOS. It always surprised me that nobody took whatever Apple threw across the fence every macOS release and ran with it – much further than “run existing open source desktops but worse” we never got when it comes to Darwin distributions (although this might change) – so perhaps having more approachable articles like these out and about get people interested.\n\nFollow me on Mastodon @[email protected]\nThe lost opportunity for Apple was not to make a server operating system out of this.\nThey already had a server OS & discontinued it around the time that they discontinued their server offerings.\nI know that. But it was limited, for smal offices and things like that. I am talking about competing with Linux in all fronts, not necessarily on Apple hardware. To eat a slice of the server market but most importantly, to turn Macs in the de facto development environments for all of that.\nLinux is free. You’re going to have a hard time competing against that…\nIf Apple made a “MacOS Server for generic PCs”, there was the risk (or should I say the certainty) that people would use it on generic PCs (instead of buying Apple’s computers). In plain English, it would require Apple to provide a version of MacOS that boots on generic PCs without modification and commit to a hardware compatibility list.\nJust because you and I wanted to see something like that, it doesn’t mean it would benefit Apple’s bottom line.\nThey could provide it without the graphical parts.\njgfenix,\nThey could provide it without the graphical parts.\nThey could, is macos really that compelling without the graphical parts? After all tons of linux developers use a macos desktop to work on linux services. If you take away the desktop, then you might as well be running linux. I could be wrong about the demand, but that’s my opinion. Apple has a marketing advantage with consumers, but those same consumers don’t care about back end systems where   apple don’t have an advantage over FOSS. Given the fact that apple dropped their server line, I suspect that even they feel the same way.\nalfman,\nThey could, is macos really that compelling without the graphical parts?\nNot particularly, no. There are better Unix-like server OSes out there.\nAn Apple RPi competitor running Darwin might be interesting as a throwback to the Apple ][, but it probably wouldn’t be more then a toy.\n@Flatland_Spider\nWhat does the Darwin kernel have to do with the Apple ][ though? I mean, it would be better just to boot straight into an emulator.\nI found one:\nhttps://github.com/FZBunny/applepi\nIt runs on Linux.\nPeople tried and what they found out is that a kernel tuned for interactive latency is bad as a server OS. Apple realized this themselves and have a bunch of Linux servers powering iCloud, etc.\nApple really should have bought Red Hat and kept RH as an independent subsidiary. RH could have built a management ecosystem and made sure macOS is a first class platform in the ecosystem.\nHuh.\nGiven the amount of code that Apple lifted from the BSDs, it would be nice if Apple pumped some of their huge stashes of cash into the BSD foundations.   Heck, even Blackberry was a donor  …\nhttps://freebsdfoundation.org/our-donors/donors/?donationYear=2024\nSure — Apple might have contributed  back to the code bases, but then so did Netflix.\n>”It always surprised me that nobody took whatever Apple threw across the fence every macOS release and ran with it – much further than “run existing open source desktops but worse” we never got when it comes to Darwin distributions (although this might change) – so perhaps having more approachable articles like these out and about get people interested.”\nEvery benchmark I’ve seen for many years has shown that Apple OS’s perform worse than the competition, even on Apple’s own hardware. So it’s not really surprising that almost no one wants to use Darwin as a base for developing another OS. Other source code is more freely available, works with vastly more hardware, and performs most tasks faster. Which makes Darwin a lose-lose-lose proposition. I wish these hobbyists well in their pursuits, but they are not likely to gain much of an audience. Apple’s success is in its branding and marketing, not in its kernel performance, file system performance, etc.\nDarwin/macOS is tuned for latency not throughput, and latency isn’t what they were testing.\nIt’s a great OS for interactive use (desktop, laptops, mobile, tablets), and a bad OS for server use.\nDesktop performance is horrible from everything I’ve seen. File system performance is awful. You can take any Mac hardware and install Windows or a GNU/Linux distro on it and improve the performance significantly.\nI’ve never felt desktop performance was a problem with macOS, and I’m probably the bottleneck with whatever desktop OS anyway.\nI run Windows, Linux, and macOS daily. They’re all fine as long as the hardware isn’t total trash; then, Linux works better.\nThat was a great read – thanks.\nprobably true for servers. I don’t know.   I do know the experience seems like the opposite when you take a bogged down windows installation, and turn it into a hackintosh . Then  it seems to stay snappy with the same amount of software installed.   Probably more of a window bloatware thing.\nThere were some interesting uses of the source in the early hackintoah days like the voodoo kernel, where they added support directly into the kernel for hardware that Apple never supported.\nI was always surprised as well that Apple Open Sourcing their kernel did not cause a bigger Open Source response. My gut instinct was that somebody would grab it, put GNUstep on top, and create an Open Source macOS clone in short order. Nope.\nWhy has the Darwin kernel not been a catalyst for Open Source innovation? A big hint can be found in the FAQ of probably the most viable macOS clone attempt–RavynOS (see Why BSD instead of Darwin?):\nhttps://ravynos.com/faq\nThe short answer is “hardware support”. They are choosing to make a macOS clone on top of FreeBSD instead of Darwin because of “hardware support”. Let that sink in. When has anybody ever chosen FreeBSD because of “hardware support”. As a Linux user, I would say that is the main reason not to use it.\nBut it makes sense.  While Apple did Open Source much of their OS, they did not include most of the drivers for Apple hardware or third-party hardware. If you look at Linux, more lines of code are for drivers than anything else. Even though Apple Open Sourced the kernel and much of the userland, a lot of the work required to make a viable operating system still needs to be done.\nAnother big factor is that the kinds of people that are attracted to macOS are not the kinds of people that value less functional Open Source replacements. So gaining ground with the crowd most compatible with the code Apple contributed would be a long road. That has probably been the issue with GNUstep as well. Despite efforts to pivot, it has been more of a continuation of the NeXT APIs than a real alternative to Apple. Hopefully that changes.\nHelp keep OSNews alive!"}

We’re big fans of its performance and price performance. It has allowed so many photographers get reach without selling their car or a kidney.\nUnfortunately, we have now seen multiple reports of a possible weak point in the construction of the lens, and it may not be an ideal lens in challenging environments.\nJoshua Holko, who some of you may know or remember a few articles he has written for the site. He is currently in Svalbard, which is a challenging environment, and his RF 200-800mm f/6.3-9 IS USM split in half while in a backpack.\nThe Canon 200-800 is a very sharp lens. It does offer amazing bang for buck performance for those who need reach on a budget. However it is NOT an L series and not built to withstand the same punishment. This lens (not mine) was not dropped, it was in the camera bag on the back of the snow mobile safely secured. Plastic internal construction instead of magnesium makes all the difference…\nWe have also seen two others that have been split in half. One of the lenses was hit off the side of a safari vehicle in Zambia and the front half fell out of the vehicle. Smacking a lens off things in safari vehicles isn’t unusual. Sometimes one has to move quickly, or space is tight.\nMy gear has a lot of scars from African fun times.\nThe third report involved the lens also breaking in half, but the shooter has no idea what happened. He was out shooting birds in some wetlands of Florida. He thinks it’s possible the lens was banging off something in his bag. He wasn’t using it at the time and discovered it when he opened his bag.\nCanon did fix his lens under warranty.\nIt looks like the lens halves are mounted using a standard sort of plastic. This isn’t an unusual material choice in non-L lenses.\nIs this a design flaw or do we have to realize the 200-800 isn’t built to the same standard as a lens such as the RF 100-500mm f/4.5-7L IS USM? You are paying for how L lenses are put together and the materials used inside the lens along with the optical elements.\nWe aren’t slamming the RF 200-800, we just wanted to let you know what we have seen over the last few months. It’s a great lens, but getting this sort of information out there is a good idea for everyone. Know what you’re shooting with!\nIf you’ve had a similar issue with the lens, we’d love to hear from you. We we want to stress that we’re not trying to cause a ruckus, we just think it’s important to let people know when we find something that could ruin one’s day out shooting.\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.\nGo to discussion...\nCraig is the founder and editorial director for Canon Rumors.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nUnless you’re a real stickler for the finer points of the consumer tech industry, you might not know the history of the Vaio laptop series. But to miss the chaos unfolding from the Trump administration’s massive tariffs, you’d have to be living under a rock, under a penguin, on an uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean. The current owner of Vaio is leveraging this chaos to sell a few “tariff free” laptops.\nTo address the first point: Yes, Vaio (stylized VAIO) laptops are still a thing, originally launched by Sony back in 1996 but spun off into an independent Japanese manufacturer when Sony exited the laptop business about a decade ago. It’s currently majority-owned by Japanese retailer Nojima. At the moment, Vaio offers three different series—the SX, SX-R, and FS—in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes. The designs are unremarkable and don’t often get spotted even on big retailers, but it looks like they’re getting some love from Costco as a US sales partner.\nAccording to Tom’s Hardware, the Vaio brand sent out emails to some customers hoping to lure them in with “Tariff Free Inventory.” While it doesn’t go into specifics, this is undoubtedly a reference to US president Donald Trump’s latest round of tariffs on nearly every country that supplies finished goods and raw materials to the United States. This sent stock prices and other economic indicators into a tailspin, in what’s already being referred to as “the 2025 stock market crash.”\nFor the Japanese Vaio brand, which manufactures all its current models in a Nagano factory, the relevant tariff is the 24 percent tax on products from Japan, according to Reuters. Depending on how the tariffs are implemented on specific components, the 34 percent tax on goods from China and 32 percent tax on goods from Taiwan may also come into play for laptops sold in the US. \nIn the best-case scenario, Vaio’s cheapest laptop at the moment will jump from $1,100 to $1,364, assuming Vaio passes the cost directly onto retailers and final buyers. For the SX-R mentioned in the “tariff free” email, the starting price would jump from $2,200 to $2,728 for the same model. For more estimations on how tariffs will affect consumer electronics prices, check out this breakdown. The prices on the Vaio website as of April 7th don’t seem to have changed much since January, as seen on the Internet Archive.\nIt seems like a safe assumption that Vaio is promoting prices for current inventory held within the United States, which can be sold at today’s prices without fear of tariffs affecting profitability. It’ll be a few weeks before the latest round of tariffs imposed on goods being imported to the United States start impacting finished items being sold to consumers.\nIf you’re in the market for a new laptop in the US, you might want to look for one right away. As Vaio demonstrates, there’s only a limited amount of computers in current supply line that can be sold at pre-Trump prices.\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

But with the right choice, you can ensure that your CPU will continue to offer solid performance in the future. \nIf you’re a gamer, an AMD X3D CPU is an excellent choice to keep your hardware performing in the long term. AMD’s X3D models with 3D V-Cache, such as the Ryzen 5800X3D, have proven to deliver outstanding performance in CPU-intensive games even years after their release. \nNewer models such as the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D or the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D continue this trend and currently offer the best gaming performance.\nCurrent prices: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D\nHigh-performance CPU series such as AMD’s Threadripper ensure reliably high performance over several years. However, to achieve this future-proof performance, you need to make a real investment when purchasing.\nAMD \nIf you have a limited budget, mid-range CPUs such as the Ryzen 7 7700X or Ryzen 5 7600 are still an excellent alternative. These processors will continue to deliver over 60 frames per second in most games for years to come — albeit with certain limitations for particularly demanding future titles.\nA modern quad-core CPU such as the Intel Core i3-12100F is perfectly adequate for everyday office use and less demanding tasks. Even older processors such as the Intel Core i5-2500K, which is over 10 years old, can still handle many everyday tasks without any problems.\nFurther reading: Ryzen 7 7800X3D: 5 things you must know about AMD’s gaming titan\nA current processor with four cores will therefore offer reliable performance for at least half a decade. With a little more budget, you can also opt for a six-core CPU such as the aforementioned AMD Ryzen 5 7600 model. This processor is even more versatile and promises an even longer lifespan.\nMaximum computing power: The 3D-V cache of AMD’s X3D processors enables extremely high data rates and therefore a significant increase in performance compared to CPUs without this special buffer memory.\nAMD\nProfessional users who earn their living with a PC should invest in high-end CPUs. Models such as the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X or the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K are ideal for multi-threaded workloads. They remain competitive for years, even with the most demanding tasks. If you are prepared to invest even more, you can also take a look at AMD’s Threadripper series.\nWith a high-end CPU like this one from AMD, there’s a good chance you’ll have several years of peace of mind when it comes to upgrades. The prerequisite for this is that you know exactly what your requirements are and find the right CPU model for you.\nAMD \nThese processors are specially designed for professional applications and offer extreme performance for complex professional tasks. The choice of the right processor ultimately depends on your individual requirements. Gamers benefit from powerful gaming CPUs, while cheaper models are perfectly adequate for everyday office use and simpler applications. \nReading tip: Save your money! Most PC gamers don’t need a flagship CPU\nProfessional users should choose high-end variants in order to remain competitive at work in the long term. With thorough research and the right decision, you can ensure that your CPU will be able to cope with the demands of the coming years.\n\nThis article originally appeared on our sister publication PC-WELT and was translated and localized from German.\n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters"}

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nChances are, if a monitor sits on your desk, more than one device is plugged into it. Maybe your setup is a personal PC and a work laptop, or a computer plus a gaming console. Perhaps it’s all of the above. (Yes, I do live at my desk, thank you.)\nLiving this way can come with one small hassle, though—switching between device inputs can be hard on some monitors. I’m stuck going between a couple of buttons to get to the input menu, then selecting the correct one. No nice monitor with dedicated buttons for each input port. (Seriously, that’s a quality of life feature worth paying for.) But I found a better way. \nThe solution that took me way too many months to arrive at? I stuck something on my display’s bezel, right over the buttons I need.\nAlaina Yee / Foundry\nTape, stickers, editor’s flags—the world was my label oyster. I’m currently honoring my roots in print publishing with two leftover editor’s tabs (we used these to keep track of page printouts during production), but I’m considering a move to stickers for better adhesion. I know a young kid who’ll have plenty of options for me to choose from. A spot of painter’s tape or even Scotch tape would work, too.\nYeah, I know most modern displays auto-switch between devices if only one system is turned on, but that doesn’t always happen for me. Sometimes I have multiple PCs turned on, too. I also could try to hone my depth perception so that I stop inevitably hitting the button that turns off the monitor instead of the one that finalizes the input selection. (Insert skull emoji here.)\nThe Registi / Unsplash\nOr I could just buy an HDMI switcher or a KVM switch, but look, I’m cheap. Also, switchers sometimes have their own quirks to deal with, which I once learned the hard way during a sweaty Overwatch match. Sorry to my teammates, I was literally playing with my monitor off for a bit. (Insert multiple skull emojis here.)\nAnyway, I’m aware this is one of those “hacks” where if you naturally think of things like this, it’s a no-brainer. I grew up in a home where I would have caught major trouble if I gummed up a monitor bezel with adhesives, so it’s not my first instinct. (In fairness, back then, they could ruin surfaces.) But these days, it’s pretty easy to remove and clean up any residue if you eventually upgrade and want to give or sell your existing monitor to someone else.\nAlso, I’m a full adult now, so if I want to gunk up my monitor bezel, I can.\nA 14-year veteran of technology and video games journalism, Alaina Yee covers a variety of topics for PCWorld.

Not keeping up with maintenance could mean your garden quickly starts to resemble a jungle. Two new robot lawn mowers from eufy hope to change your outlook on garden maintenance.\nThe eufy E15 and E18, available for sale now, are a pair of connected robot lawn mowers. These clever gadgets can take this chore off your hands by bringing smart tech into your yard. Read on for more details and a $300 off discount code.\nDesigned to simplify maintaining a perfectly trimmed lawn, eufy E15 and E18 deliver precision cutting, smart navigation, and energy-efficient operation.\nMuch like a robotic vacuum cleaner, these eufy lawn mowers make use of a feature called Vision Full-Self Driving. It spots and avoids obstacles, from lawn edges and stone pathways to that football your kid left out in the yard yesterday. It can also dodge any pets that are too lazy to move out the way of the robot approaching them.\neufy\nUnlike you would with some alternative models, there’s no need for you to set up a boundary wire or complicated RTK antenna. You simply unbox the robot, connect it to Wi-Fi, place it on the grass, and leave it alone to do its job. These eufy robots will automatically map the yard on their first outing, and then simply get on with trimming the grass. Meanwhile, you can take a seat and relax with a coffee and a good book.\nEach eufy model seeks to deliver a uniform cut, and by meticulously routing their path across the yard they leave no area untouched. Whether you opt for the eufy E15 or E18 will depend on how much ground you want it to cover: the E15 can handle yards up to 0.2 Acres (800 square meters), while the E18 can mow up to 0.3 Acres (1,200 square meters).\nBoth robot lawn mowers can handle cutting heights as low as 25mm and as high as 75mm, and will easily climb slopes up to 18 degrees. You should, however, make sure to remove stones and debris from its path and fill out any holes in the ground before letting them loose on your garden.\neufy\nThe accompanying base station sits close to your lawn, making for an easy return path, but also allowing the robot to make a quick return to the station if it senses rainfall.\nBoth E15 and E18 feature an anti-theft system, using GPS and 4G to offer location information. So, if you’re worried about someone picking it up off your front lawn and making a run for it, you should know you’ll be able to keep track of its location through the eufy app.\neufy’s Robot Lawn Mower E15 costs $1,600, while those with larger lawns should consider the $1,999 E18. The eufy E Series Robot Lawn Mower models can be ordered directly from the eufy website or via Amazon.\nPurchase before April 30 with the promotional code eufyRLE15 on Amazon to save $300 on the E15 model, bringing it down to just $1,300!\nSave $300 on eufy E15 at Amazon with code eufyRLE15\n\n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters"}

If so, Mozilla has your back.\nSaltiness aside, current nightly builds of Firefox include an experimental link preview feature that shows an AI-generated summary of what the linked page is (purportedly) about, so you can check before you visit it, saving you time, a click, or the need to use critical thinking.\nFirefox generates its AI summaries locally, on device – great for privacy but not for speed\nNo data about you or the link preview (or its summary) is sent to remote servers or third parties, so no-one (sentient or data centre) can glean info on whatever it is you were thinking about having a look at.\nThe upside: Firefox’s link preview AI summaries are generated locally, on your device. \nThe downside: Firefox’s link preview AI summaries are generated locally, on your device.\nSnark as there is a big speed hit to running “AI” inference locally: it’s slow. I tested it on my laptop and, similar to Firefox’s AI-powered on-device text translation, it took ages to do its things. The first summary bullet point didn’t appear for a good 10 seconds.\nArguably, it’d be faster to visit the link myself evaluate the content using human intelligence.\nI know; I’m a luddite.\nSure, this might be handy for the occasional link (especially one you’re a bit “eh” about visiting) but as-is it’s simply too slow to “elevate” productivity and “empower” users with a “seamless” experience – it’s an AI-generated speed bump.\nIt’s also not accurate.\n“Key points are AI-generated and may have mistakes”, the link preview warns. It ought to add “…but will be devoid of nuance, humour or originality” given the banal, boilerplate and routinely wrong “key points” it derived from processing my own content. \nIf you want to try link previews with AI summaries yourself, you can — only in a nightly build of Firefox 139 right now (though depending on when you read this article, it may be available in the beta release channel too, or it might not – life can be like that). \nUpdate: Link Previews are now available in Firefox 138, albeit as an experimental feature and only in select locales. To see if it’s available for you, go to about:settings#experimental and if you see the Link Previews setting, turn it on.\nTo enable Firefox link preview with AI summaries: \nOnce activated you then hold shift + alt and hover your cursor over a web page link you wish to see a preview of (it also works for story cards on the Firefox New Tab Page).\nAfter a pause, a link preview box should appear. Emphasis on should, as this feature’s reliability proved inconsistent in my hands on. Hovering over a link and pressing the keys often did nothing… Your milage may vary.\nA “first-time setup” runs on the initial preview showing a loading bar to indicate that an on-device AI model1 is downloading in the background (which is roughly ~350MB). \nThereafter, each time you press the keyboard combo and hover over a link you’ll see an image preview, web page description (pulled from metadata, if available) and a 3-point AI summary for content.\nFor now, only in English languages.\nIt is possible to get Firefox to generate an AI summary for a link in languages other than English (requires a separate flag) but you might not wish to. \nFirefox feature hawk Soeren Hentzschel notes the error rate increased substantially when he tried it on German articles.\nC’est la vie.\n—Err, that’s French.\nFirefox adding AI-powered page summaries is inevitable now that Mozilla’s all-in on AI in an effort to it “diversify” away from its “legacy products”. \nCompared to the Orbit by Mozilla AI Add-On for Firefox, this is a more subtle. It only summarises pages you’ve not yet visited, and then only on-demand. As it’s on-device (Orbit uses a Mozilla AI data server) there’s a greater privacy assurance too.\nRight now this feature is experimental, unfinished and not ready for wider use. Parsing, speed, unreliability and (I hope) preview modal size will no doubt improve over the coming months. When it rolls out to stable builds it will be better than it is now.\nIn conclusion, don’t expect perfection from Firefox’s AI summary feature just yet — but it’s a’coming!\n\nBy buying me a $2 coffee, you’re directly funding continued independent coverage of the Linux ecosystem—content for you, and for everyone!\n© 2025 Ohso Media"}

Here's what we found", "fullContent": "A rumor that cellphones are 10 times dirtier than toilet seats has circulated online for years.\nFor example, iterations of the claim have appeared on Instagram, Facebook and Reddit since at least 2019.\nThe Facebook post's caption read: \"Your phone is 10 times dirtier than a toilet seat!\" The Instagram post's caption echoed this statistic, and the video itself included a screenshot of a blog post on the University of Arizona website, titled, \"Why your cellphone has more germs than a toilet.\"\n \nA post shared by Dr. Pal Manickam (@dr.pal.manickam)\nIn short, it was not possible to find a study that concluded that people's cellphones are 10 times dirtier than a toilet seat. The claim originated from an article published online by a now-defunct website called \"MyHealthNewsDaily,\" which included comments from a microbiologist at the University of Arizona. However, at no point in the article was the expert reported as producing the explicit claim that cellphones are 10 times dirtier than toilet seats.\nBelow we outline what we found regarding this rumor. \nIn 2006, Charles Gerba, the aforementioned microbiologist at the University of Arizona, reportedly told NBC in an interview that telephones and keyboards found in the office are particularly dirty. Gerba reiterated this sentiment again in a 2010 TEDx lecture in Phoenix (starting at the 6:28-minute mark of the video below), during which he said that phones are among the \"germiest objects\" in offices, along with desktops, computer mouses and first-floor elevator buttons.\n\nHe told the audience:\nMost of us actually work in offices today, but nobody ever really thought about hygiene in offices until about a decade [ago]. We started studying and we realized how incredibly germy the average office is. We found that most people don't clean their office desk until they start sticking to it, and the number of bacteria and viruses we found was really quite surprising. \nThe germiest objects in your office, by the way, are going to be your phone, your desktop, your computer keyboard and your computer mouse. So those are some of your germiest objects. \nHowever, in neither instance did Gerba specify whether he was talking about cellphones or landlines.\nIn August 2012, the now-defunct health news website MyHealthNewsDaily published an article, titled, \"Why Your Cellphone Has More Bacteria Than a Toilet Seat.\" The report featured the claim that \"cellphones carry 10 times more bacteria than most toilet seats\" and included quotes attributed to Gerba. The article was also published by the \"Today\" morning TV show (archived), and the following month the University of Arizona published a now-deleted blog post linking to the \"Today\" article (archived here).\nHowever, Gerba was not reported as making that specific claim himself anywhere in the MyHealthNewsDaily article. Instead, the claim was introduced by the reporter, who wrote: \"Cellphones carry 10 times more bacteria than most toilet seats, so it shouldn't be surprising that a man in Uganda reportedly contracted Ebola after stealing one.\" The claim, however, was not attributed to a source. Likewise, the MyHealthNewsDaily report did not cite any studies that concluded that cellphones are 10 times dirtier than toilet seats.\nSnopes has contacted Gerba, the University of Arizona and the reporter for comments on the claim and for assistance in locating the scientific research or literature upon which this rumor was based. Neither Gerba nor the university had replied as of publication. The reporter said she was unable to comment, and added that she had written the piece roughly 13 years ago as an intern at MyHealthNewsDaily.\nTherefore, it was not possible to conclude whether cellphones are 10 times dirtier than toilet seats based on this article. There have been some studies into how dirty cellphones and toilet seats are; however, none of these studies made comparisons between the two.\nMost of the scientific literature on how dirty cellphones are has focused on the cellphones of health care workers in hospital settings. \nStudies in 2009, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2022 across numerous countries all found that cellphones contain potentially harmful bacteria, viruses and fungi, including E. coli, Staphylococcus and those that exhibit antibiotic resistance. \nAdditionally, a small-scale study of 27 phones in 2017 found that secondary school students' phones commonly had highly pathogenic bacteria.\nFindings like these prompted scientists in 2024 to dub cellphones a \"Trojan horse\" for infectious germs.\nTherefore, it comes as no surprise that one in six mobile phones tested in a 2011 British study was shown to be contaminated with fecal matter, likely because people do not wash their hands properly after using the restroom.\nResearchers have found that the space under a toilet seat can sometimes host pathogens, which can transmit from the bowl during flushing or \"during a bout of acute diarrhea\" when there is \"splashing.\"\nBacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have also been found on toilet seats.\nAs always, medical experts recommend washing hands thoroughly for the best protection against harmful pathogens.\n596K Views · 4.5K Reactions | Your Phone Is 10 Times Dirtier than a Toilet Seat | Your Phone Is 10 Times Dirtier than a Toilet Seat! | By Hashem Al-Ghaili | Facebook. www.facebook.com, https://www.facebook.com/ScienceNaturePage/videos/your-phone-is-10-times-dirtier-than-a-toilet-seat/361994888023593/.

America’s creative industries are part of what make this country great, and stealing their work is un-American and wrong. Tell Washington today to make Big Tech companies pay for the content they take.\nThe ad campaign features attention-grabbing red-and-white banners containing phrases like \"Protect Jobs from AI Theft,\" \"AI Steals from You Too,\" \"Keep Watch on AI,\" and more.\nAs we settle into the new week, expect to see these banners in \"hundreds of news publications and digital outlets\" across the US. The campaign has three main requests from the US government:\nPresident and CEO of News/Media Alliance Danielle Coffey argues that the news media industry is not necessarily anti-AI. Still, it wants to see a \"balanced ecosystem where AI is built responsibly, providing return to the quality content that fuels its intelligence and drives international competitiveness.\"\nThis comes several days after OpenAI released a new image-generation tool that went viral for its ability to generate images in the style of the Japanese animation studio Studio Ghibli, as well as generate fake receipts.\nThe image \"ghiblification\" affair really upset some people, especially artists on X who are pretty anti-AI. Last year, some of them decided to leave the platform altogether because X chose to train AI on user posts.\nThey switched to alternatives like BlueSky, where, wait for it, a machine learning librarian at Hugging Face actually caught heat after releasing a dataset made from publicly available BlueSky posts for anyone to train their models on.\nOpenAI and other AI labs have clashed with members of the News/Media Alliance in the past. A notable example is The New York Times's December 2023 lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging unauthorized use of its articles for AI training. Just last month, a federal judge ruled that the lawsuit could proceed, rejecting OpenAI's request to dismiss.\n\n\nDavid Uzondu\n                                                ·\n                    \nMar 13, 2025\n\nwith\n1\n                            comment\n                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\nAditya Tiwari\n                                                ·\n                    \nMar 12, 2025\n\nwith\n1\n                            comment\n                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Uzondu\n                                                ·\n                    \nNov 22, 2024\n\nwith\n1\n                            comment\n                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\nKarthik Mudaliar\n                                                ·\n                    \nMar 23, 2024\n\nwith\n4\n                            comment\n                                s\n                                                            \n\n\n\nLogin or Sign Up to read and post a comment.\nPlease enter your reason for reporting this comment.\n\n                                chromebook\n                                \n\n                                amd rx 9070\n                                \n\n                                gamesir super nova\n                                \n\n                                windows 11\n                                \n\n                                t-force 7200\n                                \n\n                        windows update\n                        \n\n                        change screenshot folder\n                        \n\n                        windows 11 unamused\n                        \n\n                        cuktech 10\n                        \n\n© Since 2000 Neowin®\n                                    All trademarks mentioned are the property of their respective owners.\n                                "}

To learn from her, we need to consider which phase of her career she was ... More in. For most companies this is when she first established a niche market in country music.\nOne is the biggest pop star on the planet. The other is one of the world’s most valuable companies. But Taylor Swift and Amazon have two things in common. First, they are both outliers in terms of success. Swift’s Eras tour was the highest-grossing music tour ever, generating more than $2 billion. Amazon has a market cap of more than $2 trillion and is the global leader in several industries. Second, they are both used to explain why particular strategies lead to success. Amazon is cited in no less than 700 Harvard Business Review articles for exactly this purpose.\nThe problem for strategists is that, as outliers, Swift and Amazon are able to do things others can’t. Drawing strategy lessons requires a chronological approach.\nI spoke to Kevin Evers, the author of There’s Nothing Like This. The Strategic Genius Of Taylor Swift and a keen observer of business strategy, to understand which insights from their extraordinary success are transferrable, at which stage of a corporation’s lifecycle.\nEntrepreneurs have three options. They can enter an established market doing the same thing that everyone else does, come up with a new twist, or target an entirely new niche market. The last option—often called a Blue Ocean strategy—is hard to pull off. However, it also offers entrepreneurs an opportunity to carve out a dominating position that lasts. That’s what both Swift and Amazon did.\n“Swift wanted to write songs for an audience of her peers—teenage girls,” Evers points out. Country music did not see this as a market. Even more unusual, she wanted to write her own songs.\nTo pull it off, Swift needed a partner that was fully aligned with her vision. Even though she had a development contract with RCA, a big player, she decided to go with Scott Borchetta who was starting his own label. Evers explains what that means: “He didn't have funding. He didn't have headquarters. He didn't have much of anything, really. But it ended up working out because Brochetta had a lot of skin in the game.” He needed this to work as much as Swift.\nFor new entrepreneurs the takeaway is obvious: developing a new niche market is tough and you need a fully committed partner with complementary skills. For Amazon that partner was Ingram, a wholesaler for books. Amazon’s relationship with Ingram meant it could list over a million titles right from the outset, even though its own warehouse only had a capacity of 2,000. In essence Jeff Bezos’ technology became the web frontend for Ingram.\nSwift’s first album was a major success. She had carved out a new audience in country music. But what would she do next? Should she double down or venture into something new? “The answer was a bit of both,” Evers explains. “Swift and her team were very careful not to alienate people in country music. But they also gradually started to move more into pop music.”\nThey did this carefully and deliberately as “they reconfigured some of her songs so they would play better on pop radio.” One reason Swift was able to make the move so successfully was that she had built a strong fan base, using emerging social media—at that time MySpace—to connect with them directly. Most of her fans were not concerned about the genre of music that Swift made, they only saw the artist. However, to complete the transition, new partnerships were needed. This meant working with new producers and leveraging the networks of her distributor, Universal Music Group.\nInfiltrating pop without losing the country connection meant that Swift created a second growth engine. Amazon did the same thing when it moved into selling music and videos, gradually building a full-fledged online store. It did not stop there. In 2000 Amazon Marketplace became a third growth engine, two years later followed by a fourth, Amazon Web Services.\nImportantly both Amazon and Swift did so after they touched the ceiling of their niche market. For companies who still have space to grow within their initial market, it makes sense to stick to what they know—and are known for—rather than getting distracted by new opportunities.\nAt a 2016 technology conference Jeff Bezos made a somewhat puzzling statement: “When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes.” What he meant is that a Golden Globe nomination brings more customers to Amazon’s website but they end up buying something different. The big platform thrives on customer interaction. To oil this customer engagement machine, Amazon introduced Prime. For $12.99 you get access to binge-worth programming but also free shipping. A tactic that would not work without a big platform.\nThis is not the only unusual move that is unique to Amazon. The company is also known for building backwards. It starts with what would be a great product for customers, then gradually begins to build the required skills to deliver it. A good example is the Kindle. The plan was to do it with six people in 18 months. But as Steve Kessel, who lead the original Kindle team, later conceded, “It took us three-and-a-half years and a lot more than a couple of handfuls of folks.” That approach is only possible with very deep pockets. For most companies the more appropriate strategy starts with the competences it has rather than going for moon shots.\nToday Amazon and Swift are outliers who can do things few others should try to copy. In Swift’s case this became obvious when she decides to eventually move fully into pop. Her label was worried about dropping the sizable country market and less successful artists would have no choice than listen to this advice. Swift did not and because of her powerful platform it worked. “It was potentially leaving a big segment of her market, yet she came up with one of the best-selling albums of the 2010s—1989,” says Evers.\nFor the latest she did not even release singles but instead created a TikTok series called “Midnights Mayhem with Me”, where she picked a numbered ball and then announces the corresponding name of an album track. This would not work for most artists, but in Swift’s case it created a social media buzz that propelled her to even greater success.\nArticles often use examples from outliers to substantiate an idea the authors want to propose. That’s an easy trap to fall into. While outliers can offer great strategy lesson, this only works if you consider the phase you are in and match it with a moment in time when they were in a similar position. For most companies this will be phase one. For some it will be phase two. For very few, it will be phase three.\nWhile you work towards that third and final phase, I can recommend the excellent book by Evers which draws many parallels between corporate strategy and Swift."}

Check my main feed for more in-depth articles on stargazing, astronomy, eclipses and more.\nThe stars and constellations of spring may be dominating the night sky, but we’re about to lose them to a full moon. Since it’s due to turn into a full pink moon this coming Saturday, take a moment each night to cast your eyes to the southeast sky in twilight to see a waxing gibbous moon gradually build in brightness, lightening the night sky as it does.\nMonday, April 7: Waxing Gibbous Moon In Leo \nThe constellation Leo is a classic spring constellation. If you can make out its sickle shape (which looks like a backward question mark), it’s impossible to miss whenever you’re outside at night. Tonight, a 79%-illuminated waning crescent moon will shine high in the southeast, just in front of the lion, close to the bright star Regulus, also known as the heart of the lion. This blue-white star 77 light-years from our sun is one of the brightest in the April sky.\nThursday, April 10: Three New ‘Belt Stars’ Align\nThe winter constellation of Orion may now be slumping into the western horizon after dark, but a temporary replacement for the three famous stars in Orion’s Belt has been building for months. Buzzing around the two brightest stars in Gemini — Castor and Pollux — for months, the planet Mars will appear to align with them in a straight line tonight after dark.\nSaturday/Sunday, April 12/13: Full Pink Moon\nApril’s full moon, the pink moon, will rise in the east for North Americans during dusk on Saturday, April 12, in a monthly show of beauty unmatched in nature. Alongside it will be Spica in the constellation Virgo, unless you’re in South America, where this bright star will disappear behind the moon for a short time. In Europe, the pink moon will be seen rising during dusk on Sunday, April 13.\nFull moon rises behind Saint Jean-Baptiste (San Giovanni Battista) statue over Baptistery in Pisa, ... More Tuscany, Italy, on April 5, 2023. April full moon is also known as pink, egg and fish moon.  (Photo by Lorenzo Di Cola/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nMany main religions use a lunar calendar, at least in part. This weekend’s full moon is also known as the Paschal moon, as its timing determines the date of Easter. The rule of thumb is easy — Easter Sunday for Western Christianity falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox. For the Eastern Orthodox church, the rules are different — with the date of the Jewish festival of Passover decisive. It makes no difference this year — both will celebrate Easter Sunday on April 21.\nThe times and dates given apply to mid-northern latitudes. For the most accurate location-specific information, consult online planetariums like Stellarium.\nWishing you clear skies and wide eyes."}

It’s how I keep up with all of my (tech) news, for example from The Verge and Ars Technica. If a news site or blog doesn’t have a RSS feed, I won’t keep up with it, sorry.\nThe big downside with RSS though? You get all the articles that are in the feed. And unless your RSS reader of choice offers built-in mute or filter functionality, you’re just stuck with those articles. And sadly most RSS readers do not offer any kind of filtering capabilities, or when they do, it’s locked behind a paid plan (looking at you, Feedly Pro+, requiring a $9/month plan if you want to “mute the noise”). For example I love The Verge, but I don’t want to read anything related to Trump, their podcast, shopping deals (that are only valid in the U.S. anyway), or their very basic how-to articles.\nThe solution seemed pretty simple to me: build a service that filters public RSS feeds, and spits out a new RSS feed without the articles that match keywords or categories you’re not interested in. So I built RSSfilter.com, that does exactly this. The core logic is open-sourced as a Django app, called django-rss-filter. You can use this to self-host your own version of RSSfilter.com. It includes unit tests and an example Django project. Version 0.1.0 has just been published to PyPI!\nAnd with that I can create the perfect version of The Verge’s RSS feed just for me:\n\nFreelance software developer with over 25 years of experience. Writes articles about Swift, Python, and TypeScript. Builds Critical Notes, and maintains a bunch of open source projects.\nNo AI was used in writing any of the content on this website.\nMany people quickly reach for a big CMS package for Django, when often this is overkill. Here’s how to use a simple Django model with a CKEditor 5 WYSIWYG field, including embedded media like YouTube.\nWhen you have admin users in multiple time zones, the way Django handles the input and display of dates and times is causing confusion.

The US stock market had a second day of steep declines, with all three indexes down over 5% for the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite entered a bear market, the first time a major index fund has done so since 2022. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 saw its biggest daily drop since the pandemic.\nUS Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell issued a rare warning that the tariffs could lead to both higher unemployment and higher inflation. “We face a highly uncertain outlook,” Powell remarked.\nIgnoring Powell’s words of caution, Trump instead said on social media that Powell should cut interest rates. “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS,” Trump said.\nCarmakers continued to offer deals to customers in light of the new 25% tariffs placed on cars and auto parts. Stallantis and Hyundai became the latest manufacturers to say they’ll offer discounts to US customers in the coming months, as fear of higher car prices take over.\nNintendo announced that the release of its Switch 2 will be delayed amid Trump’s new tariffs, an early sign of the supply chain issues the new levies will have on products.\nClick here to read the full article.\n*\nClick the share button below to email/forward this article.

With a hefty price tag of around £70 million, his potential acquisition stirs plenty of discussions. Based on insights from David Lynch, who spoke to Dave Davis for Anfield Index, Semenyo’s performance has certainly put him on the radar for top clubs, including Liverpool. This piece explores the implications of such a move and whether Semenyo could indeed be the next star at Anfield.\n\n\nAntoine Semenyo’s journey in the Premier League has been noteworthy. With a style that Lynch describes as reminiscent of Sadio Mane, Semenyo offers a blend of speed, skill, and a sharp eye for goal. “I think he will be liked [by Liverpool] and any player that is performing at that level in the Premier League will be of interest,” Lynch noted. It’s clear that his attributes align well with Liverpool’s dynamic attacking philosophy under manager Arne Slot.\nMoreover, Lynch pointed out, “So the links don’t surprise me at all and I think he is really on the cusp of exploding pretty soon.” The excitement around Semenyo isn’t just about his current form; it’s about his potential to grow into a Premier League star. Liverpool, known for developing talent under the bright lights of Anfield, could be the perfect stage for him to shine.\nThe comparison to Sadio Mane isn’t made lightly. Mane, who was instrumental in Liverpool’s recent successes, provided a unique blend of pace, power, and unpredictability. Semenyo seems to bring similar traits. “He gives me Sadio Mane vibes a bit and I wouldn’t be surprised if he is on the list for the summer,” said Lynch. This likeness could be crucial as Liverpool looks to rebuild and recalibrate their attack, especially considering the ongoing uncertainties surrounding other squad members.\nThe potential signing is also contextualised by the situation with Luis Diaz. Lynch commented, “Of course, it all depends on what happens with Luis Diaz but if he was to move on then potentially Semenyo would be one to watch out for.” Liverpool’s strategy could pivot significantly if Diaz were to leave, making room for Semenyo to step in. The club’s ability to adapt its squad efficiently in response to departures has been a hallmark of its strategy, and this situation appears no different.\nWhile the allure of a player like Semenyo is undeniable, the financial aspect of this transfer warrants a discussion. At £70 million, the investment is substantial. For Liverpool, the decision to spend such an amount must be backed by a strong belief in the player’s ability to contribute significantly. The Premier League’s inflationary transfer market makes every such decision crucial. Liverpool, with a history of savvy market moves, will weigh this heavily.\nAntoine Semenyo represents both a promise and a gamble for Liverpool. His potential to evolve into a key player for the Reds is evident, but as with all high-stakes transfers, only time will tell if the gamble pays off. As Lynch aptly puts it, Semenyo is “on the cusp of exploding,” and Liverpool could be just the right place for that to happen. As the summer window approaches, all eyes will be on Anfield to see if this rising star will don the famous red jersey.\nIn the dynamic and often unpredictable world of football transfers, Semenyo’s case offers a fascinating glimpse into the strategic thinking that goes behind building a squad capable of competing at the highest levels. Whether or not Liverpool finalises this deal, the interest in Semenyo is a testament to his abilities and the club’s ongoing quest for excellence.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

And now, the anxiety around Trent Alexander-Arnold is starting to feel more real than rumour. The Scouser’s contract is ticking down and, as murmurs grow louder about interest from Real Madrid, his future feels increasingly uncertain.\nNo declarations, no statements, no assurances. Just the persistent buzz of a potential farewell. While some hold on to hope that Alexander-Arnold will recommit to the club where he became world-class, others are already glancing toward what comes next.\nDidi Hamann, never one to mince words, believes Jeremie Frimpong is the natural heir should Alexander-Arnold pack his bags. Speaking to Poker Scout, the former midfielder said: “I was surprised that no one signed Jeremie Frimpong last summer for around £40million. There was an option and nobody took it, but he’s a brilliant player.”\n\nIt’s a compelling endorsement, and Hamann makes the case with clarity: “He has lots of pace, he scores and sets up goals, he’s a very modern player and he would do a great job in the Premier League. He’s more of a wing-back than a full-back, but he would be a great player for Liverpool to have.”\nSlot’s system – still largely theoretical – will demand full-backs who can offer thrust and guile. In Frimpong, the Reds would get both.\nOf course, Conor Bradley remains a promising option. But as Hamann rightly points out, the 21-year-old’s injury record raises questions about relying solely on him. Frimpong, in contrast, is battle-tested in Europe and a regular in Xabi Alonso’s title-winning Bayer Leverkusen side.\nAnd he’s not just energy and overlapping runs. Frimpong’s numbers this season speak for themselves: four goals and 11 assists in 43 appearances. That’s output many wingers would envy, let alone a right-back.\n“He’d give another option outside of Mohamed Salah who likes to cut in on his left foot,” added Hamann. “Every team needs pace and he has certainly got it.”\nBorn in Amsterdam, raised in England, developed in Manchester City’s academy and polished in Germany — Frimpong’s journey feels tailor-made for a return to the Premier League. His deal with Leverkusen runs until 2028, but Liverpool know as well as anyone: contracts are merely leverage, not locks.\nIf Alexander-Arnold leaves, replacing his vision, passing range and local connection is almost impossible. But in Frimpong, Liverpool may find a player who offers a different brand of brilliance — less architect, more accelerator.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

As reported by Caught Offside, the England international has a £60 million release clause written into his current deal, and interest from top Premier League sides is intensifying.\nSources close to the situation suggest Liverpool and Arsenal are currently “Eze’s main suitors”, though Manchester United, Manchester City and Tottenham are also monitoring the situation closely.\nEze has been a standout creative force in a fluctuating Palace side, and his form has not gone unnoticed. With Palace facing potential pressure to sell, the 26-year-old could be one of the more accessible elite-level midfielders in this window.\nLiverpool’s midfield rebuild under Arne Slot is likely to focus on variety and fluidity, especially in advanced areas. Eze offers something different. His blend of ball-carrying, flair, and final-third invention would contrast the current options of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai, whose play styles skew more towards transitional control and verticality.\n“Liverpool could also surely do well to bring in someone like Eze to give them something a bit different in that department,” the report notes — a sentiment likely shared internally at Anfield.\nAt Arsenal, Eze is viewed as a player who could ease the creative burden on Martin Ødegaard. With Champions League football and a Premier League title race in mind, squad depth and unpredictability will be critical.\n“Eze could be a terrific signing for Arsenal right now, giving them a bit more X-factor in the middle of the park,” the piece continues.\nWith Eze approaching his peak years, Palace may see this summer as the optimal moment to cash in. His departure could also aid their efforts to retain other prized assets like Marc Guehi, Adam Wharton, and Jean-Philippe Mateta.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\nEberechi Eze? Class player. No doubt. But £60 million is a serious chunk of money — especially when Liverpool have already spent heavily in midfield over the last 12 months.\nIf Arne Slot wants a new dimension in that area, sure, Eze fits the mould. He’s got quick feet and unpredictability, and he thrives in tight spaces. But the question is: where does he start? Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, even Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott — all bring different qualities. Do you bench one of them? Or are you spending £60 million on a rotation option?\nEze would definitely lift the quality and creativity of the squad. But with other areas needing attention — centre-back depth, defensive midfield, perhaps even a new striker — is this the right allocation of funds?\nIt’s tempting to get excited, but Liverpool need to be precise this summer.

After another inconsistent season from their current No.9, the club appears ready to cut ties and reinvest in a forward who can deliver regularly at the highest level. As Liverpool.com reports, “Liverpool’s desire to sign a new striker this summer is an open secret, with the club expected to recruit a replacement for Darwin Nunez.”\nNunez, though admired for his athleticism and work rate, has not delivered with the consistency expected of a £64 million signing. Across 138 appearances, he’s returned just 40 goals — a modest return for a team aiming to compete across multiple fronts. With interest from Saudi clubs in January and expectations of a busy market in the summer, Liverpool may finally be prepared to listen to offers.\n“Al-Hilal reportedly offered $85 million in January, which in retrospect Liverpool probably wishes it had accepted,” the report continues, highlighting the financial pressure to secure value in any outgoing deal.\nAmong the options being explored, Napoli’s leading striker has emerged as a genuine candidate — but not without complications. While admired by Liverpool’s recruitment staff, financial realities may quickly intervene.\nNapoli have held firm over the striker’s valuation. “Considering the player’s contract in Naples is due to expire in the summer of 2026, there is no chance that any club will be paying that amount of money this year for a player that could be available for free 12 months down the line.”\nThe striker’s hefty release clause of $148 million, combined with salary demands, led to Chelsea pulling out of negotiations last summer. “Also, Osimhen’s refusal to accept a lower salary was a major factor in Chelsea not stepping up its interest in the 26-year-old last summer. His salary would have to fit into Liverpool’s wage structure.”\nIt’s a deal that would require compromise — both from Napoli and the player himself — for Liverpool to seriously advance.\nNewcastle United’s striker is considered a more stylistic fit, but financial expectations could price Liverpool out once again. “The chances of Isak being available for what Liverpool would deem an acceptable price are slim,” states Liverpool.com, adding that while Julian Alvarez could be an intriguing option, his availability is questionable after just one season at his current club.\nLiverpool’s strategy under Arne Slot will likely be a mixture of pragmatism and ambition. The striker must be more than just a finisher — he must fit a high-pressing system, offer link-up play, and have the technical quality to operate in tight spaces.\nAny significant arrival is likely contingent on player sales. Nunez is the obvious departure, while Diogo Jota remains a possible, albeit less likely, exit given his injury issues and current role in the squad.\n“There has been some talk that Diogo Jota could leave too after a disappointing season which has been hampered by fitness issues and poor form, but he is ahead of Nunez in the pecking order under Slot,” the report explains.\nWith Financial Fair Play and squad balance in mind, Liverpool’s recruitment must be shrewd — the days of inflated, headline-grabbing deals feel a world away.\nFor Liverpool, this feels like a crucial moment. Nunez has had time, chances, and patience from the Anfield faithful — but the numbers don’t lie. Missed chances, erratic decision-making, and limited build-up play have all contributed to his slide down the pecking order.\nReplacing him won’t be easy. The striker market is thin, inflated, and often full of risk. That’s why fans are intrigued by the Napoli star. He brings pace, power, and genuine presence in the box. But if his fee and wages damage the club’s structure, it’s not worth it.\nMore importantly, the next striker must fit Slot’s vision. This isn’t about individual brilliance; it’s about chemistry, movement, and intelligence. Isak ticks those boxes. So too, perhaps, does Alvarez. But the message is clear: this summer is about precision, not panic.\nWhoever comes in must be ready to wear the No.9 shirt at Anfield — not as a burden, but as a beacon for a new era.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

As reported by TEAMtalk, the Reds have already initiated contact with the 22-year-old’s representatives, viewing him as a ready-made addition to Arne Slot’s evolving system.\nWith Alexander-Arnold widely expected to join Real Madrid on a free transfer in the summer, his absence—currently compounded by injury—has already disrupted Liverpool’s rhythm. The Dutch head coach has trialled Curtis Jones at right-back in recent fixtures, but the experiment faltered during the 3-2 defeat to Fulham. The recent return of Conor Bradley offers some respite, but Liverpool’s pursuit of external reinforcements suggests long-term planning is well underway.\nAccording to TEAMtalk, “Liverpool have made contact with Sildillia’s representatives over a potential move,” and internal sources believe “he is ready for the step up to the Premier League.”\nWhat makes Sildillia’s situation especially appealing is the contractual context. Entering the final year of his deal at Freiburg, the Frenchman has yet to agree to an extension—despite the club’s best efforts. This opens the door for Liverpool to negotiate a cut-price deal, with reports suggesting he could be secured for as little as £12 million.\nThat figure, in today’s market, represents serious value—particularly for a player with versatility and defensive solidity. Sildillia has made 16 Bundesliga appearances this term and contributed to seven clean sheets, underlining his growing pedigree at the top level.\nHis ability to operate both as a right-back and right-winger gives him the sort of tactical flexibility that Arne Slot favours. For a Liverpool side in transition, players who can cover multiple roles without compromising quality are vital.\nHowever, Liverpool aren’t alone in their admiration. Marseille are expected to re-enter the race for Sildillia’s signature, with manager Roberto De Zerbi long understood to be a fan. TEAMtalk confirmed, “De Zerbi tried to bring him to Marseille last summer,” but Freiburg resisted at the time, hopeful of renewing the defender’s contract.\nNow, with the club facing the possibility of losing him for nothing in 2026, the pressure is on to cash in. “The cut-price valuation will make him attractive to other suitors,” the report added, meaning Liverpool must move decisively to win this particular battle.\nSildillia’s name is just one among several as Liverpool prepare for a significant summer of change. Alongside the Freiburg star, Bayer Leverkusen’s Jeremie Frimpong is also being monitored, while other positions are under active review.\nBournemouth’s Milos Kerkez remains a top target at left-back, and TEAMtalk reports that Liverpool “are in a strong position to get a deal done.” Further up the pitch, with Darwin Núñez’s future uncertain, potential striker additions like Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap and Wolves’ Matheus Cunha are under consideration.\nWith so many moving parts—departures, injuries, and contract situations—Arne Slot’s first summer transfer window promises to be a critical one. But if reports of a £12 million swoop for Sildillia prove true, it could represent both a bargain and a blueprint for the club’s evolving recruitment model.\nThere’s a lot to unpack for Liverpool fans here. First off, the Sildillia link makes a lot of sense. He’s young, athletic, experienced in a top European league, and available at a cut-price due to contract dynamics. For £12 million, it’s a no-brainer—especially when you consider the inflated costs usually associated with Premier League talent.\nWhat stands out is how much faith the club still seems to place in smart, opportunistic deals. This isn’t a headline-grabbing £50m move—but that’s not the point. Liverpool’s success in recent years has often been fuelled by smart scouting, and Sildillia fits the mould of an unpolished gem with major upside.\nThe bigger question is whether he’s seen as a direct replacement for Trent or more of a squad option behind someone like Conor Bradley. If Alexander-Arnold does leave for Real Madrid, it leaves both a creative and leadership void, not just a defensive one. Can a 22-year-old stepping up from Freiburg really fill that? Possibly not yet—but as part of a wider squad overhaul, he could be crucial.\nAnd with Arne Slot keen on adaptable, system-oriented players, Sildillia might just be the right man at the right price.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

Among the emerging targets is a standout talent from Ipswich Town, drawing attention from Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United.\nAs Caught Offside reported, “Liverpool are looking to improve their attacking unit, and they are keeping tabs on the Ipswich Town striker, Liam Delap.” While the name may not be making headlines week in, week out just yet, his form this season has been quietly building momentum — enough to prompt scouts from the top flight to take serious notice.\nAll three clubs reportedly had representatives in attendance over the weekend, watching the 22-year-old in action. With 12 league goals so far in a struggling Ipswich side, his profile has continued to rise. According to the report, “He has been described as a ‘quality player’ recently, and there is no doubt that he has the attributes to succeed at the highest level.”\nFor Liverpool, the pursuit reflects a wider effort to fine-tune a forward line that has lacked consistency in recent months. Despite sitting near the summit of the Premier League, there remains a sense that an upgrade on certain options — notably Darwin Núñez — could be critical for the long term. Delap, still raw, is seen as a project player who could blossom with the right coaching.\n\nTottenham’s interest highlights their desire to increase depth. With Dominic Solanke likely to carry the bulk of responsibility up front, they will need options as they return to European football. Delap could serve as a dynamic secondary striker, developing while contributing in domestic cup and rotation fixtures.\nNewcastle, meanwhile, are looking ahead. With Callum Wilson’s future uncertain and Alexander Isak constantly linked with moves elsewhere, securing a young, versatile forward makes sense. As Caught Offside states, “Delap will want to compete at the highest level, and the opportunity to join clubs like Liverpool, Tottenham or Newcastle will be hard to turn down for him.”\nIpswich’s impending relegation adds further complexity. With Championship football looming, their bargaining position will inevitably weaken. Caught Offside notes, “Ipswich will certainly go down to the Championship, and they will be under pressure to sell some of their best players.”\nDelap’s own ambitions make it likely he’ll push for an exit. At 22, with his best years ahead, the timing is perfect to move into a top-level setup. Given the interest and context, a summer deal appears increasingly likely — and clubs that hesitate could easily miss out.\nWhile not a guaranteed starter at any of the three Premier League clubs, Delap fits the mould of a smart, long-term acquisition. He is a modern forward — strong, mobile, and capable of pressing from the front — and would offer flexibility for managers looking to add energy and physicality to their attack.\nHis ability to grow into a consistent performer will depend on where he lands and how quickly he adapts to the Premier League’s pace and tactical complexity. But all signs point to a player ready to take the next step — and ready to be moulded into a top-level striker.\nThis rumour is more intriguing than it might first appear. While many fans would hope for a marquee name to lead the line or support Mohamed Salah, adding a young, Premier League-ready forward to the mix could be a smart move.\nDarwin Núñez remains a polarising figure — moments of brilliance offset by inconsistencies in front of goal. Diogo Jota’s injury history means reliability is in short supply, and Luis Díaz’s future remains uncertain. Delap wouldn’t need to start immediately, but with his athleticism and attitude, he could be nurtured into a key contributor.\nWhat Liverpool can’t afford to do is stand still. If Arne Slot is to hit the ground running post-Klopp, the squad must be balanced, forward-thinking and competitive. Signing a player like Delap might not steal headlines, but it’s exactly the type of move that builds dynasties — calculated, not reactionary.\nAnd if Liverpool don’t act fast, someone else will. That’s the nature of modern recruitment — delay, and you miss out.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

Accordi… [+3461 chars]", "title": "Liverpool Linked With Major Signing as Slot Shapes Post-Salah Future", "fullContent": "Change is rarely gentle at a club of Liverpool’s stature, especially when it concerns one of the most iconic players in their modern history. According to Fichajes, the Anfield hierarchy may be preparing for life without their talisman, with reports emerging of a record-breaking €140 million offer made to Real Madrid.\nThe interest is said to stem from a growing realisation at Liverpool that Mohamed Salah may not extend his stay on Merseyside. While recent speculation suggested new contract talks were progressing, FSG are clearly preparing for both possibilities — renewal or departure. “They claim the decision is based on FSG’s determination not to be ‘left behind’ by the prospect of losing Salah and that ‘negotiations over his sale can begin in the next few days’.”\nWith Arne Slot now at the helm, planning for the future has taken a sharper tactical shape. The player in question — unnamed here due to editorial style — is viewed as an ideal fit for Slot’s style. As Fichajes noted, he is “regarded as a perfect player for Slot’s system and ‘one who can perform from day one’.”\nThis isn’t about simply filling a shirt — it’s about ensuring Liverpool’s forward line remains potent and tactically intelligent. The player in question brings versatility, Champions League pedigree, and a winning mentality that could help usher in the next chapter at Anfield.\nDespite the eye-catching figures and supposed urgency behind the scenes, not everyone is convinced the deal will materialise. Fichajes may have stoked anticipation, but more grounded voices urge caution. Journalist Ben Jacobs previously reported “there were no advanced discussions between Rodrygo and Liverpool, or indeed with the winger and any other club.”\nMoreover, should Salah decide to stay, there is logic in the player’s reluctance to make the switch. With both operating in similar roles, the presence of Salah could dissuade any big-name arrival in the same position.\nRecent concerns over Salah’s goalscoring form were addressed directly by Slot, who appeared unfazed by a brief dry spell.\n“For me it’s simple,” Slot said of Salah. “Sometimes the fixture list is more difficult than other periods of the season… ”\nSlot added: “No, Mo knows probably his biggest quality is he can play a poor game and still score a goal. So his head is not all over the place. Not at all.”\nThe message is clear: Salah’s value transcends form. But it doesn’t mask the need for Liverpool to prepare for an era beyond him, whenever it comes.\nAs Liverpool supporters, the idea of losing Salah still stings. This is a player who redefined the modern forward — goals, consistency, leadership, and relentless desire. But time waits for no one, and planning for the future is not a betrayal — it’s necessity.\nThe suggestion of a €140m bid from Liverpool shows serious intent, even if it’s speculative. If true, it suggests FSG are ready to step into a new transfer tier — one that matches the club’s ambitions and global standing. Whether this deal happens or not, fans can take heart in the clear effort to maintain attacking excellence beyond the Salah years.\nThis is no scattergun approach. The player fits the Slot blueprint and brings elite-level experience to match Liverpool’s needs. If Salah stays, fantastic. If he leaves, Liverpool seem determined to ensure it’s a transformation, not a decline.\nIt’s time for the next Liverpool era to take shape — and reports like this show the club’s eyes are wide open to the challenge.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

The conversation, facilitated by Dave Davis, highlighted the significant impact Conor Bradley had on the game, marking a tactical pivot for Arne Slot’s side as they navigate the Premier League’s final stretch.\n\n\nLiverpool’s recent games have exposed a glaring gap in their flank, particularly with Trent Alexander-Arnold sidelined due to injury. David Lynch noted, “Trent has been a big miss in the past few games and Liverpool’s creativity has massively dipped along with the progressive nature of their play.” The absence of a natural full-back has evidently disrupted Liverpool’s fluidity, a point made painfully apparent during their recent outings.\nJarell Quansah and Curtis Jones were tasked with makeshift roles that deviated from their natural positions. Lynch pointed out, “Jarell Quansah has done a job there but is of course a central defender, whilst Curtis Jones likes to keep the ball more rather than progress with it.” This makeshift arrangement has had mixed results, illustrating the challenges of adapting under pressure.\nEnter Conor Bradley, whose introduction against Fulham sparked a visible improvement in Liverpool’s dynamics. Lynch’s observation underscores this shift: “Conor Bradley can’t pass like Trent, but he dribbles and runs with power through the middle and as soon as he came on, Liverpool looked miles better.” Bradley’s direct and energetic style of play provided the missing link in Liverpool’s attack, revitalising their offensive thrust.\nMoreover, Bradley’s presence had a ripple effect on Liverpool’s key striker, Mohamed Salah. Lynch remarked, “Also, all of a sudden Mo Salah was in the game and he has really missed having an actual right-back making them runs around him.” The synergy between Bradley and Salah could be a critical factor in Liverpool’s performance in the absence of Alexander-Arnold.\nWith Liverpool now sitting comfortably at the top of the league table, despite the setback against Fulham, the focus shifts to maintaining momentum. As Trent faces a prolonged recovery, Bradley’s role could be pivotal. Lynch expressed hope for the young full-back’s continued impact: “Trent is going to be out injured for a while now, so hopefully Bradley can contribute in this final run of games.”\nLiverpool’s adaptability under Slot’s management will be crucial. The team’s ability to integrate Bradley effectively not only speaks to their resilience but also highlights their depth, a factor often scrutinised by pundits and fans alike.\nAs Liverpool forges ahead, the adaptation seen in players like Conor Bradley is a testament to the team’s depth and Arne Slot’s tactical flexibility. While the loss against Fulham was a blip, the emergence of Bradley offers a silver lining. His development into a more prominent role could be one of the defining narratives of Liverpool’s season as they aim to clinch the Premier League title.\nIn essence, Liverpool’s current scenario is a blend of challenge and opportunity. How they navigate this with young talents stepping up will be intriguing to watch, especially with the league’s climax fast approaching.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

While supporters may have hoped to see the Brazilian back in goal, head coach Arne Slot made it clear that player safety continues to come first, even in the midst of a tight Premier League title race.\nSlot’s update after the Fulham match emphasised Liverpool’s commitment to medical standards and long-term player wellbeing, rather than risking a rushed return for one of their most crucial players.\nAfter suffering a collision while on international duty with Brazil last month, Alisson has been following concussion guidelines, which ruled him out of the Merseyside derby victory over Everton and now the loss to Fulham.\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, Slot explained the club’s position:\n“Yes, he did [not pass the concussion protocol]. There’s a week to go [until the next match] so that gives us a bit of time. But you know as Liverpool we always follow the protocol in moments like this when it’s a concussion. If you haven’t ticked all the boxes, he can’t be in goal. He wants it a lot but the protocol is the protocol.”\nIt’s a clear message from Slot and the medical team: no corners will be cut, no matter how eager the player is to return.\nConcussion management has become an increasingly important issue across all levels of football, with strict criteria now in place to prevent players from returning prematurely after sustaining a head injury. Liverpool have consistently taken these matters seriously, and Alisson’s case is no different.\nIn Alisson’s absence, Caoimhín Kelleher has been the man between the sticks. The Irish shot-stopper is well regarded within the club and has proven reliable in big games — most notably in cup competitions — but Alisson’s world-class presence has understandably been missed.\nThe Reds edged past Everton 2-1 in a closely fought derby, but defensive stability looked more vulnerable during the 1-0 defeat to Fulham. While Kelleher cannot be blamed for the result, Alisson’s command of the box, distribution, and leadership are elements that give Liverpool added confidence and calmness at the back.\nWith the title race finely poised and key fixtures on the horizon, supporters are understandably eager to see the Brazilian return. However, Slot’s insistence on following protocol serves as a reminder of the bigger picture: health and player longevity over short-term gain.\nThe good news from Slot’s comments is that there is optimism around Alisson’s return. With a full week to prepare for the next fixture, there is time for the goalkeeper to complete the final stages of the concussion protocol, provided he meets the required criteria.\nThis typically includes:\nAbsence of symptoms at rest and during light exercise\nMedical assessment by the club’s doctors\nA progressive return to full training\nApproval from independent medical personnel, if required\nThe medical staff will assess him daily to ensure that no symptoms resurface, with any setback resulting in additional rest and monitoring. Given Alisson’s importance, there’s no room for risk, especially as Liverpool remain in contention for multiple honours this season.\nOne of the early indicators of Arne Slot’s management style has been his focus on professionalism, preparation, and protecting his squad. His handling of Alisson’s situation reinforces his belief in long-term thinking and placing player health ahead of results.\nSlot’s response reflects well not just on himself but on Liverpool as a club. The unwavering adherence to medical protocols — even for a player of Alisson’s stature — sends a strong message about values, ethics, and modern footballing culture.\nWith so many clubs around the world still grappling with how to treat concussion and head injuries seriously, Liverpool’s approach stands out. It’s no surprise that Slot ended his comments with clarity and confidence:\n“He wants it a lot but the protocol is the protocol.”\nWhile the loss at Fulham is undoubtedly disappointing in the context of the title race, the decision to keep Alisson sidelined is a firm and commendable one. Protecting a player’s long-term wellbeing must always take priority, even when short-term pressures mount.\nLike all Liverpool fans we will be hoping the No.1 can return in time for the next clash, but if not, they can at least take pride in supporting a club that puts its people before the points.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

But perhaps that’s precisely why it matters. After a stunning 26-game unbeaten run in the Premier League, Arne Slot’s side finally stumbled – and not due to being outplayed, but by simply giving too much away. As David Lynch observed when speaking to Dave Davis for Anfield Index, “If you give three goals away in the first-half, then you’re always going to have to play unbelievably well in the second to salvage anything.”\nFulham, to their credit, capitalised on every misstep. This wasn’t a tale of tactical collapse or systemic weakness. Rather, it was a catalogue of individual errors. Lynch was clear on this: “It’s not even like you can say there was a systemic issue because it was more than there was so many individual errors.” That clarity is essential. Liverpool didn’t fall apart — they fell short.\n\n\nCredit where it’s due — the response was everything one would hope for from potential champions. Liverpool roared back in the second half, dominating possession, pressing with intensity, and playing with belief. “To be fair to them, they almost did. That second-half performance was really good and was deserving of three points but they left themselves too much to do,” Lynch said.\nIt’s that blend of frustration and reassurance that defines this game. On another day, this could easily have been another late Liverpool win, a continuation of a narrative we’ve seen all season. But not this time. And perhaps that’s for the best.\nArne Slot, who has quickly stamped his authority on this side, now faces his first significant league loss. But it’s worth repeating Lynch’s words: “They have to take this defeat in their stride, but it is their first in 26 league matches which might make things a bit easier.”\nThis is not a crisis. It’s a reminder. In a league as unforgiving as the Premier League, complacency is punished — not always by title rivals, but sometimes by sharp, hungry sides like Fulham. “It shows you how good this league is and that a side like Fulham can absolutely punish you if you make those mistakes,” Lynch added.\nThe timing, if such things can be planned, is almost helpful. With seven games remaining and an 11-point cushion, Liverpool have space to reset. It’s better to have this wake-up call now than in a high-stakes match come May.\nWhat stands out most is that this wasn’t about being tactically outclassed — it was about concentration. “Liverpool probably created their own nerves and we’re just not used to that this season because they usually do really well at limiting shots on their goal,” Lynch said. It’s a psychological slip rather than a physical or structural one.\nThat’s why the response to this defeat is more important than the defeat itself. Slot’s job now is to ensure this performance is the exception, not the beginning of a pattern. Champions react. Champions learn. Champions adapt.\nIn many ways, this game will be forgotten quickly if Liverpool return to their usual relentless selves. But in private, within the dressing room, it might linger — as fuel, as warning, as motivation. And that’s not a bad thing at all.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

I had been working with her to process the memory of an assault I suffered as a young child, and for the first time, I felt like I wanted to scream or break something.\nUp until that point, I’d minimized any feelings of rage associated with my childhood trauma. I thought: Getting angry doesn't change the past. Shouldn’t I just be grateful I survived and focus on the positives? \nAs the fog of denial lifted, I imagined having the temper tantrum I never had as a kid. I felt like I’d missed out on an important, healthy, natural response to injustice and abuse. \nMy therapist gave my question serious thought. She researched, made phone calls, and found a “smash room” nearby that offered a safe space and privacy to unleash some anger. We talked about it and planned to have my next session there. \nThe night before the appointment, I did my own research. Had other survivors found rage rooms to be helpful? Could smashing dishes and electronics really help me express big feelings productively? How could I make the most of the experience?\nRage rooms are thought to have originated in the early 2000s with “frustration spaces” or Japanese crying rooms. They became more popular in the US during the 2008 financial crisis, when people looked for places to relieve stress safely and affordably. \nI read various articles and realized rage rooms are also somewhat controversial. Some experts believe they’re a healthy form of catharsis. But others warn that if you struggle with anger management or are prone to destructive coping mechanisms, a rage room is like throwing gasoline on the fire. \nDebates aside, rage rooms are a cultural phenomenon, especially among women who have been conditioned to suppress anger and aggression politely. The owner of the smash room I visited confirmed that most of his customers are women. \nOne thing was indisputable in my research: For people who are working through and grieving childhood trauma, identifying and expressing anger is an important part of the healing process. Instead of exiling those feelings, survivors benefit from the opportunity to channel them into meaningful action. \nShattering a few dishes was not about reinforcing violence or making it bigger for me. It was about reclaiming my power and agency. I needed to see the anger. I wanted to make it visible to myself to stop denying and minimizing what had happened years ago. \nAs a kid, I’d been left to manage my feelings on my own. But now, I had a unique opportunity for a corrective experience. Having my therapist there as a witness and guide meant that I didn’t have to process the pain alone. She challenged me to look at healthy anger as a form of self-care. Like with any strong emotion, I could tap into rage and experience it in small doses without being consumed or paralyzed by it. \nBefore entering the rage room, she checked in with me to see how I felt and what I hoped to get out of the experience. I told her I was nervous. What if I went numb and nothing came up? What if everything came up? Would I lose control?\nIn the end, what happened was much more nuanced. I began slowly, tentatively throwing a few dishes against a wall and watching shards fly into the air. But then, I grabbed a crowbar and started hitting things with more abandon – ceramic mugs, small appliances, a flat-screen television. My therapist handed me new items to smash and reassured me I was safe. \nI felt a type of strength and energy I hadn’t experienced before. It was as if I'd opened up a new pathway in my body and allowed the 5-year-old version of me to be seen. \nNormally, I intellectualize and talk through my problems. But in the rage room, I found it hard to speak at all. I felt oriented to the present moment and attuned to my senses. Every sound, sensation, and visual was sharp. I dropped into my body and connected with the parts of me that had no words, just grief.\nAfter the session, I felt exhausted but peaceful, like I’d released decades of pent-up frustration. That night, I slept more soundly than I had in a long time. \nI don’t think I’ll become a regular customer at the rage room, but I’m grateful for the experience. It unlocked something important in my healing process. It showed me I don’t have to be afraid of strong emotions. I can allow them to surface and also seek support when they feel too big to manage. \nIn the end, by honoring my outrage, I honored my younger self. \nGina DeMillo Wagner is a journalist and author of Forces of Nature.\n\n            Get the help you need from a therapist near you–a FREE service from Psychology Today.\n      \nPsychology Today © 2025 Sussex Publishers, LLC\n\n            The brightest way to shine is by being fully, imperfectly yourself.\n      \nSelf Tests are all about you.

New Orleans has nine total picks, starting with the No. 9 pick.\nThe Saints freed up over $60 million in cap space in March through a series of releases, restructures and pay cuts, allowing them to sign new free agents like safety Justin Reid, retain players like defensive end Chase Young and tight end Juwan Johnson and even bring back former wide receiver Brandin Cooks.\n\"We nailed it when we were able to get Justin,\" Saints coach Kellen Moore said at the annual league meetings last week. \"Obviously, you recognize there was a lot of other teams chasing after him and so we feel really, really excited that ultimately he made the decision he wanted to come back to Louisiana.\"\nThey also made some under-the-radar moves, such as signing former Tennessee Titans offensive lineman Dillon Radunz to a one-year deal worth $2.25 million, filling the space left by left guard Lucas Patrick, who signed with the Cincinnati Bengals on a $1.3 million deal.\nMoore said that Radunz, who can play multiple positions, could compete for the starting left guard spot.\n\"Coming off a season where I started at guard, so guard would be where I feel most comfortable at, right over left. I played left side in college, played right side all last year,\" Radunz said. \"Comfortable there, but ultimately at the end of the day, it's whatever gets me on the field quickest. ... Obviously I think [left] is where there's an open competition right now, so that's what we're going to gun for.\"\nThe Saints could go in almost any direction in the draft, although the biggest question will be whether they target a quarterback in the first round or beyond. New Orleans restructured quarterback Derek Carr's contract, effectively keeping him on the team through this season.\nBut the team has also shown interest in quarterbacks throughout the draft process, attending Miami quarterback Cam Ward's Pro Day. Ward, ranked as the best quarterback prospect in the 2025 draft, is expected to be the No. 1 pick.\n\"The quarterback position obviously is a valuable position in our league. We all know that, so I'm a quarterback guy. I do like seeing quarterbacks,\" Moore said.\nWhether the Saints choose to go the quarterback route, they also have some more immediate needs, including cornerback, due to the departures of Paulson Adebo and Marshon Lattimore.\nNew Orleans attempted to fill that position by targeting cornerback Charvarius Ward in free agency, but he signed with the Indianapolis Colts on a three-year deal averaging $18 million a year. Reid's three-year deal with the Saints averages $10.5 million each year.\n\"Free agency has a lot of conversations in a very short period of time and there's a lot of overlap and so we felt like both of those players would've helped our team and we had the flexibility to handle that however we needed to,\" Moore said when asked if they could have signed both Reid and Ward.\nThe Saints re-signed CB Isaac Yiadom instead for an average of $3 million a year.\n• Marvin Harrison Jr. bulking up for Year 2\n• Giants roster in better shape than 2024\n• Raiders have high hopes for rookie CB Porter\n• Mannion's path to becoming Packers QBs coach\n• How Seattle rookie TE Arroyo affects Fant\nWide receiver also could be a priority despite the signing of Cooks, especially if the Saints look to add a bigger-bodied type to complement their current room.\n\"Anybody in a perfect world wants to have a basketball team with some tall, some short, some quick, some big. We're flexible,\" Moore said. \"Certainly the people part of it is really, really valuable to us and we feel like we brought in an excellent player and person in Brandin.\"\nAlthough Moore jokingly acknowledged the Saints' tendency to trade up in the draft, if they were to keep every pick, it would take about $5.4 million in cap space to sign their drafted rookies. That's due to the rule of 51, which means that only the top 51 contracts count against the salary cap in the offseason.\nThe Saints will spend more money in the fall to sign a practice squad and add players to the roster as injured replacements, but unless they make a big offseason move, it's likely they'll roll over a significant amount of money into the 2026 salary cap. New Orleans has carried over more than $5 million in space just once since the 2012 season.\nSo what could they do with their remaining space?\nWhile the Saints will likely wish to roll over a lot of their space to 2026 to address those issues, they could still attempt to sign some free agents following the draft to fill any remaining holes this year. Some recent players signed in May who played significant roles include Patrick and safety Will Harris (2024), tight end Foster Moreau (2023) and wide receiver Jarvis Landry and safety Tyrann Mathieu (2022).\nAccording to ESPN's best remaining free agents list, cornerback Rasul Douglas, wide receiver Amari Cooper, cornerback Asante Samuel Jr., cornerback Mike Hilton, running back J.K. Dobbins, wide receiver Keenan Allen, guard Brandon Scherff, wide receiver Diontae Johnson, wide receiver Tyler Lockett and guard Will Hernandez are among the top 20 free agents remaining at potential positions of need.\nHowever, the Saints will have to think with at least one eye on the future when determining their next moves. They already have more than $350 million in projected salary cap liabilities in 2026 when taking into account several factors. That includes the cost of their 2025 draft class and the potential of a $15 million fifth-year option for wide receiver Chris Olave.\nThere's also the potential for a significant amount of dead money in 2026: almost $12 million if Ryan Ramczyk retires after June 1 and up to $68 million total if the contracts of six players automatically void, including defensive end Cameron Jordan, Mathieu, tight end Taysom Hill and linebacker Demario Davis.\nCarr also has a $69.2 million cap hit in the final season of his contract that will have to be addressed. If New Orleans were to release him next season, he would either count $59.6 million against the 2026 cap as a standard release or $19.2 million in 2026 as a post-June 1 release.\nMoore said he and Carr were excited to team up together, even though sources told ESPN last month that Carr was open to testing the market before his restructure.\n\"I'm excited to have him back with us really shortly. Obviously April 14 we'll start and I think that's the fun part,\" Moore said. \"These guys go through the offseason. They have a chance to spend time with their family, invest in all that, which is the right thing to do, and once you get back April 14, ... football's in the fold and it'll be a great process.\""}

Here’s how it works.\n\nChatGPT is having both a great and terrible start to the month, depending on who you ask. While OpenAI is excited about the popularity of new features like its new native image generation, ChatGPT Plus subscribers are growing increasingly frustrated with the restrictions and patchy performance caused by the chatbot's new wave of popularity – and I'm among them.\nLast week, ChatGPT had one its worst periods for outages. While they were mostly short-lived issues, the consistent problems (usually starting at 9am ET / 2pm BST) led to some understandable grumbling from subscribers who saw the gates to ChatGPT's new native image generation flung open to hordes of free users.\nAs I type, OpenAI's status page again says the company is \"experiencing issues\" and Downdetector is showing small spikes in reports – though nothing on the scale of last week, fortunately.\nThe sheer scale of last week's surge was revealed by OpenAI's COO Brad Lightcap on X (formerly Twitter), who said that \"over 130m users have generated 700m+ (!) images since last Tuesday\".\nHe added that \"we appreciate your patience as we try to serve everyone\", which was a slightly more sympathetic take compared to CEO Sam Altman's more matter-of-fact statement that \"you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges\". In other words, deal with it because we're putting our foot on the gas.\nvery crazy first week for images in chatgpt - over 130M users have generated 700M+ (!) images since last tuesdayIndia is now our fastest growing chatgpt market 💪🇮🇳the range of visual creativity has been extremely inspiringwe appreciate your patience as we try to serve…April 3, 2025\nBut while minor outages are understandable, the less obvious impacts of OpenAI's rapid scaling this month are causing more frustration. Something that hasn't been made very clear, other than in help articles, is that OpenAI Sora video generation still isn't available for new accounts over a week from when it was \"temporarily disabled\".\nA number of people have signed up for ChatGPT Plus, some even for its $200 a month Pro tier, unaware that the feature isn't available. It doesn't just affect new subscribers either – if (like me) you're an existing subscriber who hasn't yet used Sora, you can't use it for videos right now either (only images, like the one above).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nOpenAI's explanation on its help pages is that it's currently \"experiencing heavy traffic\" and that Sora video generation is only \"temporarily\" unavailable. But it's unfortunate that key Sora pages, like its one for pricing, don't mention these limitations. I've asked OpenAI for an update on when this restriction might be lifted and will update this story if I hear back.\njust went through the list of what we are planning to launch in the next few months.so much incredible stuff!April 5, 2025\nWhile these ChatGPT issues are still relatively minor in the grand scheme of what it can still do, the frustration of paying users isn't soothed by the noises coming from OpenAI's top brass – who are consistently crowing about how many users are melting its GPUs, and the new features that'll presumably worsen its capacity issues soon.\nOver the weekend, Sam Altman excitedly posted about \"the list of what we are planning to launch in the next few months\". Well, ChatGPT subscribers will be hoping that list is topped by new GPU and server capacity that can more reliably handle its influx of new users – and also deliver its full set of advertised features.\nAt the risk of sounding like a spoiled airline passenger complaining about the lack of free peanuts during the miracle of transatlantic flight, OpenAI does need to keep one eye on its paying subscribers, even as it keeps the other on growing its global user base.\nAfter all, the AI competition is hot, and Google Gemini is pulling ahead in some areas while DeepSeek and Manus AI are offering increasingly tempting alternatives for some tasks. That explains why OpenAI has thrown off the shackles and recently tweaked its rulebook to broaden its appeal. But ChatGPT subscribers will be hoping this expansion doesn't come at the expense of the quality of the experience that made them sign up in the first place.\nMark is TechRadar's Senior news editor.

Whether you work in a sustainability-focused role or want to showcase your eco-conscious approach, ensuring your CV highlights these skills effectively can set you apart. Here’s how to reflect sustainability skills on your CV and position yourself as a valuable asset in today’s evolving job market.\nIf you are applying for a role that directly involves sustainability, tailor your CV to align with the employer’s goals. Carefully analyse the job description and identify key competencies such as carbon reduction strategies, environmental compliance, or corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.\nUse your professional profile to position yourself as a sustainability-driven professional. For example, “A commercially minded operations manager with a passion for sustainability, experienced in embedding environmentally friendly practices into business operations to drive efficiency and cost savings.”\nIn your work experience section, highlight specific contributions you have made towards sustainability initiatives, such as implementing green policies, reducing waste, or developing eco-friendly products. Show how these efforts delivered measurable results, whether in cost reductions, compliance improvements, or increased corporate reputation.\nEmployers want to see tangible evidence of how your sustainability skills have made a difference. Instead of listing responsibilities, focus on achievements that demonstrate your contribution to sustainability goals.\nFor example, rather than saying “Managed a waste reduction programme,” provide a results-driven statement such as “Led a company-wide waste reduction initiative that decreased landfill waste by 40% in 12 months, saving £100,000 in disposal costs.”\nQuantifiable achievements create a compelling narrative and help differentiate you from other candidates. If you have influenced sustainability policy changes, secured funding for green initiatives, or spearheaded environmental projects, ensure these are clearly articulated.\nHighlighting sustainability on your CV positions you as a valuable asset in the job market.\nSustainability requires a combination of technical expertise, analytical skills, and strategic thinking. Ensure your CV highlights the core competencies that employers look for in sustainability professionals.\nThese might include environmental impact assessment, carbon footprint analysis, sustainable supply chain management, regulatory compliance, stakeholder engagement, and energy efficiency strategies.\nPosition these skills prominently in a dedicated “Core Skills” section or integrate them naturally within your professional experience. Use industry-recognised terminology to ensure your CV is optimised for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), increasing the likelihood of passing the initial screening stage.\nIf you have completed sustainability-focused education or professional development courses, make sure these are clearly visible on your CV. Degrees in environmental science, sustainability management, or corporate social responsibility can enhance your credibility in the field.\nAdditionally, industry certifications such as ISO 14001 Environmental Management, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), or Carbon Trust Standard can help validate your expertise. If you have attended sustainability-related workshops or undertaken online courses, include these in a “Professional Development” section to demonstrate continuous learning.\nSustainability is not just a professional competency but also a value-driven approach. If you have participated in voluntary projects, environmental campaigns, or community initiatives related to sustainability, these can add weight to your CV.\nFor instance, if you have been involved in a corporate sustainability task force, worked on climate action initiatives, or contributed to an environmental charity, include this under a “Volunteering and Extracurricular Activities” section. This reinforces your commitment to sustainability beyond the workplace and showcases your proactive approach to driving change.\nEmployers value professionals who not only have technical sustainability skills but also demonstrate leadership in promoting sustainable practices within an organisation. If you have led sustainability training sessions, written thought leadership articles on environmental best practices, or influenced company policies, highlight these initiatives.\nConsider incorporating a brief mention of sustainability in your personal statement or summary to demonstrate your commitment. For example, “Passionate about integrating sustainable solutions into business strategy, with a track record of driving environmentally responsible initiatives.”\nBy integrating sustainability skills throughout your CV – from your professional profile and work experience to qualifications and voluntary activities – you can effectively position yourself as a strong candidate for sustainability-focused roles. Employers are increasingly looking for individuals who can contribute to long-term environmental and social goals, so ensuring your CV reflects this expertise can give you a competitive edge in today’s job market."}

My devotion to the approach is partly based on a strong belief in the value of a process orientation; I don’t think organizations can improve their operations effectively without it. And I confess I also like process mining because the concept was invented by academics. I feel strongly that the combination of academic thought leadership and thoughtful adoption of their ideas by businesses is very powerful.\nThat’s a combination of forces that is working well for Apromore, a no-code process and task mining vendor, and Westpac Banking Corporation down under in Australia. Apromore was founded by two professors, both of whom are still actively involved in the company. Marlon Dumas, a professor at the University of Tartu in Estonia, has authored or co-authored a number of highly-cited books and articles on process management and mining. He’s the head of product for Apromore. His co-founder Marcello La Rosa is CEO of Apromore and a part-time professor at the University of Melbourne. He’s also published a lot on process management and mining, including one of the better-selling books on the topic (co-authored with Dumas and others), Fundamentals of Business Process Management.\nBut a software vendor can’t succeed without customers invested in making change and leveraging their wares . Westpac established an “Intelligent Process Office” in 2022, and it has rapidly addressed more and more processes over time. It started with just two staff and 21 improvement and automation projects in 2022, and progressed to a small team of full-time employees and over 150 projects in 2025. Abhi Kadian is the bank’s Chief Process and Intelligent Automation Officer, and heads what is now called the Process Intelligence and Automation Center of Excellence (PIACoE).\nAdopting Process and Task Mining at Westpac\nWestpac started with process mining because, like many organizations, its leaders wanted to help make workflows more efficient. “As a service company our processes aren’t highly visible. We see staff behind computers, not tangible processes like manufacturing companies,” said Kadian. The bank already had defined workflows, process performance targets, and various IT tools to support processes, however there were some gaps between the envisioned processes and actual work behaviors. The creation of the PIACoE was intended to provide an enabling resource for process monitoring, improvement and management—including tooling, methodologies, sources of data, and training. Process mining tells whether the process is changing and yielding the desired performance; if it isn’t, the group undertakes task mining to find out why.\nTask mining isn’t as widely used as process mining, but it’s very helpful in understanding what’s happening with work tasks at a detailed level. Process mining is macro-level, task mining is micro. Like process mining, it draws data from the software people use to do their work tasks\n“Westpac’s process analysts operate with the assumption that by showing what is truly occurring in the process at the micro task level, we can implement interventions to help achieve better business and customer outcomes,” said Kadian. For example, they found after examining poor task mining numbers that workers in one process were spending a lot of their time taking notes of what was on their computer screens. When they discussed this with the workers involved, they learned that the information in that particular system was disappearing while it was still needed. They made it more persistent, and the productivity improved immediately.\nSimulating and Optimizing Processes with Digital Process Twins\nApromore, like some other process mining systems, will identify problem areas and potential areas for improvement in the process being mined. But it goes further in creating a digital twin of the process, allowing process analysts at Westpac and other customers to simulate and optimize the process. The analyst can specify possible interventions—adding more people to perform a task or eliminating a step in the process—and understand what the implications for process performance would be.\nThe combination of process mining, task mining, and simulation for a specific process enables what Apromore’s La Rosa calls a “round trip”— mapping the process, assessing its performance, understanding problem areas with task mining, identifying options for change with digital twin simulation, and then making and monitoring the change. That approach is the key to getting better process performance from these tools.\nWestpac is certainly taking a “round trip” with its processes. Every year they do more of these engagements across the bank using all of the process tools. They’re able to do 150 projects in a year not only because they’ve added people, but also because the tools and their experience have brought down both the cost and the time of a full assessment and digital twin analysis. The cost of doing a project has come down by 85 percent over four years. Kadian has been overseeing robotic process automation (and now intelligent process automation including machine learning) projects for many years and still believes they are useful, but he feels that process and task mining are much more applicable and offer more value to the business. He argues that, “Process is everywhere and the interventions that can be applied include eliminating, simplifying and automating processes.”\n\n"}

Pretty much all the historical evidence indicates the increases in tariffs are going to lead to major trade disruptions and higher prices. Every leader of every organization should be asking: What changes most impact us directly and indirectly? So what are the implications of those changes for us? Now what should we do next?\nOverall, you likely want to use these changes in the world as a catalyst for a point of inflection to drive the things you need to do to secure your base and move towards your future aspirations. That probably means: 1) Doing things to reinforce and accelerate the cultural changes you already have in flight; 2) Reconsidering your main strategic choices; and 3) Making sure your tactical leaders can flex within your cultural, strategic, and operational boundaries to mitigate issues and take advantage of emerging opportunities.\nRemember that how you nest cultural, strategic, and tactical leadership fuels competitive agility.\nThere’s a whole range of different ways to define and look at culture from Seth Godin’s simplistic “People like us do things like this,” to the most sophisticated analyses. A middle way is to identify aspirations for Behaviors, Relationships, Attitudes, Values, and Environment (BRAVE,) the current state of those, and then focus on evolving a couple of measures at a time. One set of dimensions might look like this:\nBRAVE Culture Dimensions\nNote the third value flows from your organization’s core focus: Innovation for design-focused organizations, customer-centricity for service-focused, collaboration for delivery/distribution-focused, and accountability for production-focused.\nThe point here is that who you are and what you stand for should not change even with a major market reset. The choices you make and the way you act can change; but if you’re prepared to change what you stand for, you don’t really stand for anything.\nIdeally, your strategic choices flowed from a comprehensive strategic planning process in which you:\nThese tariffs should not have been a complete surprise to anyone other than the penguins on Heard Island. If you factored them in to your situation assessment and built contingency plans for their actually happening, good for you. If not, their implementation changes the facts of your current reality. That’s going to change the assessment of your options, which in turn may change your choices.\nIt’s worth asking the question and reconsider things even if you decide not to change your strategies.\nIdeally, you’ve built enough Tactical Capacity into your organization for your people to be able to flex within preset boundaries to mitigate the issues and take advantage of the emerging opportunities resulting from the tariff increase.\nIn contrast to other work groups that move slowly, with lots of direction and most decision-making coming from the leader, high-performing teams with strong tactical capacity empower each member, communicate effectively with the team and leader to create critical solutions to the inevitable problems that arise on an ongoing basis and to implement them quickly.\nHigh-performing teams benefit from strong delegation including:\nThis is where the three points come together.\nClick here for a categorized list of my Forbes articles (of which this is #939)"}

The immersive ride combined motion simulation with state-of-the-art special effect filmmaking to transport riders into the Star Wars universe, joining a trench run to take out the Death Star. Okay Yaramanoglu recreates the StarSpeeder 3000 in LEGO with a model with the greebles and pinstripes that will take you right back to 1987.\n\n\nWhat made the ride so convincing was the commitment to the bit of the StarSpeeder 3000 starship. Visitors could watch C3PO and R2D2 bicker about your upcoming journey as they stood next to one of the impressive transport vessels. By the time you reached the doors of the ride version, you were ready to believe that it was a lightspeed-ready craft that really could take you to Endor. Okay’s model captures the craft from every angle as you might have seen from the queue, down to the high-speed “warp drive” (the confusingly named tech from an era when Lucasfilm was a lot less attentive to jargon).\n\nOkay’s LEGO model includes a row of doors slide open in unison, just like the ride. While the StarSpeeder 3000 is for tourists, it is equipped with a pair of laser blasters for the unlikely event that the tour shoud deviate from its intended flightpath.\n\nRemoving the roof of the craft reveals room for plent of passengers. There’s plenty of legroom for most species. Just cross your fingers you don’t get seated behind a Wookie.\n\nUp front we get a glimpse ofthe ship’s captain, RX-24. Voiced by Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman), the animatronic droid was a highlight of the experience. Okay does a great job capturing Rex’s expressiveness as he prepares for his first-ever flight.\n\nIf you enjoyed this tour on the StarSpeeder 3000 in LEGO, be sure to check out our feature on builder negipon’s version of the Star Tours starship, featuring lights and motors.\nThe Brothers Brick is funded by our readers and the community.

The latest chatter involves Liverpool and their reported interest in Napoli’s prolific striker Victor Osimhen, currently on loan at Galatasaray. The insights provided by David Lynch, who spoke to Dave Davis for Anfield Index, shed some light on what could be a significant acquisition for the Reds under Arne Slot’s management.\n\n\nOsimhen’s stint in Turkey appears to be more than just another page in the loanee’s scrapbook. According to Lynch, “I wouldn’t doubt for one second that he is someone that Liverpool are keeping an eye on.” It’s clear that Liverpool’s scouting network is as vigilant as ever, eyeing talents that can bolster their attacking options. Lynch’s commentary suggests that Osimhen’s profile—marked by a robust goal-scoring record and an ideal age—makes him a prime candidate for the Premier League. “He has a great goal record and is a great age and I have no doubts that he would suit the Premier League.”\nHowever, the road to Anfield isn’t without its obstacles. Osimhen’s wage demands have been a hot topic, potentially a stumbling block for Liverpool. Lynch points out, “There was all of the talk about his wage demands and if they are outrageous, then I don’t see how Liverpool will get this done.” Yet, the possibility remains that a season away from the spotlight has reshaped Osimhen’s perspective, realigning his career aspirations with the opportunities at Liverpool. “But perhaps a season in Turkey has made him realise how much he wants this move and that Liverpool would be an attractive destination.”\nNegotiating a deal that satisfies all parties is never straightforward. Lynch reflects on the need for some concessions: “It’s not one I would definitely rule out but I do feel like there would need to be some shifting on his behalf to get this one done.” The notion that Liverpool could secure Osimhen for a “reasonable fee” compared to other market options is promising, yet the wage dilemma looms large. “I don’t question Liverpool could get him for a reasonable fee, especially compared to the other strikers on the market, but it is just the potential wage demands.”\nBringing Osimhen to Liverpool would not just be a matter of adding firepower. Under Arne Slot, Liverpool has shown a preference for versatile players who can adapt to dynamic tactical setups. Osimhen’s ability to find the back of the net in various leagues testifies to his adaptability and prowess, potentially making him an invaluable asset in Slot’s tactical framework. The synergy between a player’s skill set and a manager’s philosophy is crucial, and Osimhen could very well be the missing piece in Liverpool’s strategic puzzle.\nIn conclusion, the acquisition of Victor Osimhen by Liverpool presents a blend of opportunity and challenge. The player’s proven track record and potential for growth make him an enticing prospect, but financial realities cannot be ignored. If the parties can find common ground on the economic aspects of the deal, Osimhen could indeed be donning the red of Liverpool soon, adding an exciting chapter to both his career and the club’s illustrious history.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .
