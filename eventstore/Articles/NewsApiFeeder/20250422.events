It's a fully automated news site that publishes original, fact-based reporting each day. It has been a fun, eye-opening side project.\n\nWhy I Built It\n\nI've long been thinking about the challenges and pressures on traditional media. Social media has siphoned off ad revenue, leading to layoffs and closures. To survive, news outlets have often resorted to click-bait and polarization.\n\nI started to wonder: could I build a news site where every step was performed by AI? More importantly, could it be useful and credible?\n\nThe goal was neutral, factual reporting, grounded in real-world sources: government releases, legal rulings, financial reports, etc. No persuasion, just clean summaries of what actually happened.\n\nThe Pipeline\n\nThe system runs automatically every day via cron jobs. It creates:\n\n~22 articles/day on weekdays\n\n~12/day on weekends\n\nThe process is:\n\nScan for leads — pull from structured feeds and recent news headlines Score/rank leads — recency, quality, newsworthiness, novelty Select top candidates Do background research via AI + search Write an article Self-critique and revise Format, tag, and publish\n\nEach article costs around $0.25–0.30 in API usage. That adds up, but it's scalable in both directions. If the site gains traction, I can expand it. If not, I can scale it down without much pain.\n\nManaging LLM Behavior\n\nLLMs are capable, but prone to distraction and unexpected behavior. Here are some challenges I encountered:\n\nIf I asked the model to rate a lead on a series of metrics like recency, newsworthiness, and redundancy, it would sometimes \"reward\" redundancy just because it's a high score. I would have to normalize the direction of each metric.\n\nIf I combined too many tasks into one prompt (e.g. \"rate the leads and write an article about the best one\"), it would leak details between them. Articles would contain bits from unrelated leads.\n\nSimilarly, if I asked it to rate the 'recency' of events being considered and only select recent events, it would hallucinate incorrect recent dates for events to defend its own decision.\n\nBeing too explicit often backfires. Simpler prompts often worked better than elaborate, rule-filled ones.\n\nIn general, LLMs seemed to respond better to positive requirements than negative ones.\n\nWhen I asked it to write in AP-style, it presented itself as the associated press. Careful prompt tweaking is required to fix issues like this.\n\nIf I could explain what I wanted clearly enough, often the LLM could write a better prompt for itself.\n\nTo manage these issues, I split everything into clean stages with hard isolation between steps. Prompts are concise and focused. Unnecessary data is stripped between phases.\n\nI also relied on OpenAI’s function calling APIs, which were helpful in constraining responses to structured data and avoiding format drift.\n\nBrave Search: Better Than Expected\n\nThough I started with only OpenAI's search-preview API for research, I've also been experimenting with Brave Search for parts of the pipeline. It’s surprisingly easy to plug into a lightweight RAG system, and have the model cite recent headlines or summaries.\n\nUsing a custom search-enabled RAG system allows for more flexibility, and is cheaper than using the search-preview models.\n\nThe Stack\n\nBackend : Flask, SQLite, cron jobs and python scripts, prompts generated from Jinja2 templates\n\n: Flask, SQLite, cron jobs and python scripts, prompts generated from Jinja2 templates Metrics : Umami\n\n: Umami Frontend : Static HTML and Jinja2 templates\n\n: Static HTML and Jinja2 templates Icons : All generated by ChatGPT\n\n: All generated by ChatGPT Deployment: EC2 with Nginx and gunicorn\n\nIt’s not fancy, but with help from ChatGPT, I was able to build a complete site from scratch in about 2–3 weeks of evenings and weekends, completely solo - built entirely in my free time, outside of work.\n\nI didn't use IDE-integrated AI-assistants - my workflow was just to copy/paste code to and from a chat window and edit myself.\n\nI chose SQLite because it's easy to manage. It's not optimized for write-heavy workloads, but this is a read-heavy application. Flask is simple, and I've always liked Jinja2-style templating.\n\nWithout AI, I would have spent months just on the frontend and design alone. AI doesn't replace me as a software engineer, but the productivity boost is massive. I also never would have been able to create the icons and images on my own.\n\nCost and Scale\n\nRight now, I’m spending over $100/month just on API calls for a site that might be useful, or might be something only I read. It's a price I'm willing to pay for a hobby project for now, and I can always scale down if needed.\n\nCustom thumbnails would cost extra ~$0.04/article, so for now I'm just using static images by \"section.\" Posting to Twitter via API would cost another $100/month, so for now automatic posts only go to Bluesky.\n\nThere's plenty I could do to improve the quality of articles with higher spend too -- increasing the depth of research it does for each article, evaluating a broader set of leads, more iterations of revision, etc.\n\nWhat I'm Still Figuring Out\n\nI want to add features like:\n\nArticle upvotes or reactions\n\nComment threads (and spam filtering)\n\nHighlight-to-comment functionality\n\nBasic analytics beyond Umami\n\nEmail subscriptions\n\nBetter customization of article-generation pipelines per-section\n\nBut I'm taking it slow and balancing other time commitments. Comments and voting introduce a lot of architectural complexity and moderation overhead. They would also need a database better suited to write-heavy workloads. For now, I’m watching traffic patterns, improving content quality, and adding structure like tags and search.\n\nMore importantly, I want to improve the quality of the content. To do so, I need a way to get feedback, and that's where I need your input.\n\nImplications for Journalism\n\nAgentic Tribune can't replace journalism — it can only report on what has already been made public. There’s no substitute for investigative reporters, war correspondents, or interviews that hold powerful people accountable.\n\nIf this site, or others like it, can provide trustworthy summaries of events at low cost, they might help free up human journalists to focus on the reporting only humans can do.\n\nIf a site like this were successful, it would still need a responsible way to fund primary sources of information, beyond what is already available publicly. What does that future look like? Can this be done ethically? Will society be more or less informed?\n\nLaunching\n\nI’m planning a soft launch on Product Hunt and Indie Hackers soon. I also post selected headlines to Bluesky (automated) and Twitter (manual, for now).\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis is a fun hobby, but it’s not free. I’m spending time and money on something that might be useful.\n\nI’d love your feedback: Is the site helpful? Would you read it regularly? What’s missing? Would you trust AI-generated articles that show their sources? Would you prefer a different writing style?\n\nIs AI-generated-news a kind of inevitable market progress, or an unethical misunderstanding of journalism? Or both?\n\n**Check it out here:** https://agentictribune.com and comment below.\n\nIf you like it, follow on Bluesky or Twitter, or just bookmark it. Fresh articles published daily."}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nWhen you're trying to curb spending, some of the biggest cost-cutting mistakes you can make are overlooking recurring expenses and only focusing on small expenses. Really, you need to look at everything — including bills.\n\nBills are often seen as necessary and fixed costs, but you can often negotiate them to better suit your budget.\n\nMedical bills can be the easiest to negotiate\n\nValerie Rivera, CFP® professional and founder of FirstGen Wealth , says medical bills can be the easiest to negotiate.\n\n\"A lot of times, medical bills, if they're with a hospital, for example, they aren't building up interest along the way,\" says Rivera.\n\nChristopher Stroup, CFP® professional, founder, and president of Silicon Beach Financial agrees that medical bills can be easier to negotiate, although you have to make the call, or maybe even multiple calls, to lower or adjust costs.\n\n\"I found that for those who are willing to put in the time to potentially negotiate or renegotiate medical bills, they can actually find some savings, which they would have never expected,\" says Stroup.\n\nBesides medical bills, you might be also able to review credit card interest, insurance policies, subscriptions, or utility bills to see if there's any wiggle room.\n\nTips when negotiating a bill\n\nNegotiating a bill requires you to put in some work. First, you'll need to review your bill and ensure that the services listed are correct. Common billing errors include having services listed that you didn't get or seeing duplicate charges.\n\nWhen you make the call, Stroup says, \"Be polite, but be direct in terms of what you're seeking or what you're questioning in terms of your bill. Then, use certain phrases in terms of the care that you were expecting and that you believed you received versus what you actually saw them bill you for.\"\n\nMake sure you understand the new terms you're agreeing to. You should know the new payment schedule, if there are any penalties, and when you'll receive the final bill, says Rivera.\n\nEven if you can't negotiate a lower bill, you still may find it helpful to call to make other types of adjustments.\n\n\"It may not be a lower bill, but it might be the ability to make smaller payments along the way,\" says Rivera.\n\nAlternative strategies for lowering bills\n\nResearch competitor offers\n\nFind out what competitors are offering to see if your services are still the best fit. You might realize that there is better value elsewhere. You might also use it as a way to negotiate for a lower bill with your existing provider.\n\nUse a bill negotiation service\n\nThere are services you can use to identify and potentially lower some bills, such as internet or phone services. Rocket Money and Billshark are a few examples.\n\nKeep in mind that Rocket Money charges you a percentage (you can choose any amount from 35% to 60%) of whatever it will save you for the year for its bill negotiation feature. Billshark charges 40% of what it will save you for that year.\n\nDeclutter Your Finances with Rocket Money Losing track of your monthly expenses? Rocket Money app can help you take control by canceling unused subscriptions, tracking your spending, and organizing your financial life — all in one app. Consider it decluttering your junk drawer, but for your bank account. Clean up your finances, reduce money stress, and start saving smarter with Rocket Money app.\n\nMake lifestyle adjustments to indirectly impact your bill\n\nYou also might be able to lower some bills indirectly by making adjustments, such as switching to energy-efficient light bulbs.\n\n\"Utility bills can be fixed spending, but there are ways to make your house more energy efficient and indirectly cut spending. Maybe you can consider — which comes at its own costs — replacing your windows if you have old windows, and maybe just start with doing an energy audit of your house, says Jing Zheng, CFP® professional and founder of Neat Financial Planning.\n\nCut services you no longer want\n\nPerhaps you review your bank statement and realize you have some subscriptions you aren't using, or you notice a bill for something you thought you had canceled. You might find it's best to cut expenses entirely.\n\nAfter you make adjustments in your spending, it can be helpful to track your expenses to see where your money is going.\n\nMany of the best budgeting apps let you link bank accounts, credit cards, and investment accounts so you can get a full picture of your financial situation. You could also opt for a spreadsheet or use some of the best personal finance software."}

I survey a handful of books and articles in a particular year from math, economics, philosophy, international relations, and other interesting topics. This project was inspired by my retrospective on Foreign Affairs' first issue from September 1922.\n\nA persistent theme throughout the 1820s is the tension between Enlightenment ideals and conservative reaction. The books and articles discussed below capture various facets of this conflict. William Hazlitt’s collection of essays examines intellectuals from the turn of the century, many of whom became swept up in the Romantic movement and adopted illiberal views. J. C. L. de Sismondi’s survey characterizes international relations in the first quarter of the nineteenth century as a struggle between the forces of liberty and tyranny and is optimistic for the former. Liberal ideas were advancing steadily in education, as seen in Henry Brougham’s pamphlet on Mechanics’ Institutes and adult education and the plans to found additional universities in England outside of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nOf the bunch below, I most enjoyed Samuel Bailey’s On the Nature, Measures, and Causes of Value and The Philosopher in the Kitchen by Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin. The former proffers a subjective theory of value that is far ahead of its time both in content and style, and the latter is a time-capsule of French culture through a treatise on gastronomy.\n\nThere are several books I didn’t get to but are otherwise interesting and important. Appeal of One Half of the Human Race by William Thompson critiques the position of women in society and takes issue with fellow liberal James Mill’s claim in his Essay on Government that women need not be extended political rights. I discuss the preface below. Thomas Hodgskin’s pamphlet Labour Defended Against the Claims of Capital argues that labor is the source of all value and is, thereby, undercompensated. John Ramsay McCulloch’s Principles of Political Economy became the standard textbook in political economy until John Stuart Mill’s Principles from 1848.

This book is an extended critique of the labor theories of value developed by David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus and expounded on by Thomas de Quincey.\n\nRather than an abstract property, Bailey argues that value is a relation between two commodities at a given time defined by their ratio of exchange. The relative value I assign to two goods depends on psychological considerations and may be different than the value that you assign. Moreover, the relative value may vary over time. This view requires comparatively little metaphysical baggage.\n\nPortrait of Samuel Bailey\n\n(probably)\n\nPerhaps, instead, the amount of labor required is a good measure of value. Bailey contends that it’s unclear what’s even meant by a measure of value. A charitable view is that some common commodity such as money is a good measure of value, since we can use it as a medium to compare how much one is willing to exchange for a given commodity. This, however, falls short of the objective measure that classical economists desired, since money too can rise in value with respect to other commodities.\n\nAnother possibility is that the amount of labor required to produce a commodity is the cause of the value of the commodity. Surely, it’s a cause; however, there’s no reason to think its the cause. Even abstracting away from market conditions, the amount of capital employed in the production of a good ought to be considered as a factor. Importantly, it’s likely not the case that capital is just accumulated labor.\n\nThis book is very readable and provides a convincing critique of Ricardo’s labor theory of value. Bailey mentions Robert Torrens’ An Essay on the Production of Wealth (1821) as another recent contribution to political economy that avoids the labor theory pitfalls. In addition, Bailey’s work provides the most complete and modern citations of the time, which eases the burden of navigating the literature.\n\nRavenstone’s Funding System\n\nPublication: The Quarterly Review\n\nLink: Google Books\n\nThis is an unsigned review of the pseudonymous Piercy Ravenstone’s Thoughts on the Funding System and Its Effects (1824). This book critiques England’s method of funding its wars in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries through bond issuance, which Ravenstone alleges is both wasteful and to the benefit of the wealthy at the expense of the masses. The reviewer contends that issuing bonds by the state is more reasonable and cost effective than alternatives.\n\nAssuming the state needs to raise money for a worthy cause such as defending its territory from an invading state, how might this be achieved? If the state doesn’t borrow directly through bonds or similar instruments, it can levy a tax on the public. While this seems like a more reasonable approach, since estates can be taxed proportional to their wealth, several wrinkles emerge. What do we do about estates that are wealthy but illiquid? Have them borrow against their assets? There are efficiencies of scale to be gained by negotiating this as a single borrower as the state would. Funding a war effort diverts capital from other investments; however, removing capital uniformly will have a worse effect on returns than only employing idle capital or capital that was less productively employed.\n\nThe reviewer throws around a lot of numbers, and it isn’t always clear where their calculations come from.\n\nM’Culloch’s Discourse on Political Economy\n\nPublication: The Westminster Review\n\nLink: Google Books\n\nThis is a short and favorable review of John Ramsay McCulloch’s A Discourse on the Rise, Progress, Peculiar Objects and Importance of Political Economy (1824), which borders on advertisement. The reviewers regard this book as an important part of the coming-of-age of political economy, where the field became known and respected outside of a handful of thinkers. The reviewers pinpoint the year of ascendency to 1818, which is nearly fifty years after the publication of The Wealth of Nations (1776) and sandwiched between David Ricardo’s On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817) and Ricardo joining the House of Commons in 1819.\n\nThis is an unsigned review attributed to William Ellis and John Stuart Mill by Gonçalo L. Fonseca, the author and maintainer of the HETWebsite.\n\nPractical Observations upon the Education of the People, Addressed to the Working Classes and their Employers\n\nAuthor: Henry Brougham\n\nLink: Internet Archive\n\nMechanics’ Institutes were established in the early nineteenth century to provide education and training for the working-class, particularly those in the manufacturing. The idea was to communicate the fundamentals of the natural sciences that underlie the processes in which the workers operate. These institutes more generally sought to rectify a glaring deficiency in adult education in Britain.\n\nThe Manchester Mechanics' Institute ca. 1825\n\nHenry Brougham was a Whig MP and a vocal advocate for popular education and other liberal causes such as expanding the voting franchise and slavery abolition. In this essay, he argues that providing time and a venue for workers to learn new skills and ideas would benefit the workers, the factories, and the community. On Brougham’s vision, these institutes would be joint ventures, where wealthy benefactors provide the funds for starting up, the factories guarantee the workers have sufficient time and place to meet, and the workers themselves participate and, eventually, govern the institute.\n\nWhile there was some variation, the general blueprint is for an institute to house a library, hold reading groups, and offer full course lectures. Importantly, though, the institutes sought to fend off partisan dispute by discouraging or even banning books and lectures on theological or political matters. By the time of writing, several Institutes had been founded from London to the industrial north and Scotland. Many of these institutions exist today through lineal descent and form a large part of the higher education in the UK.\n\nPhilosophy\n\nThe Philosopher in the Kitchen\n\nAuthor: Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin\n\nTranslated by Anne Drayton (1970)\n\nFrench Title: Physiologie du goût\n\nLink: Internet Archive\n\nJean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin was a French lawyer, politician, and noted gastronome. His part-memoir part-treatise, Physiologie du goût, is a prolegomena of sorts to the science of gourmandism. One may be tempted to think that this study of food and culture is merely a guide to gluttony. Brillat-Savarin is careful to dispel such notions. The glutton mindlessly consumes to excess, while the gourmand appreciates and enjoys to satisfaction. Far from a handbook to hedonism, this analysis of the art of the gourmand encompasses gastronomy, physical and mental health, and social interaction.\n\nThe book is written in short sections loosely divided into themes, mixing technical discussions of the author’s theory of food chemistry with recipes and tales from his eventful life. The writing is often witty and the translation by Anne Drayton is a pleasure to read. I was hooked from the beginning by the list of aphorisms that preface the main text; the best of which reads:\n\nDessert without cheese is like a pretty woman with only one eye.\n\nIn the section on physical and mental health, Brillat-Savarin discusses the importance of diet in maintaining health and longevity. He makes a case for the benefits of a low-carb diet for losing excess weight, becoming one of its first proponents.\n\nThere’s an amusing mention of a correlational health outcomes study by Louis-René Villermé from the prior year. This study finds that “good cheer is far from being harmful to health, and that, all things being equal, gourmands live longer than other men.” Elaborating on the methods:\n\nHe compared the various classes of society in which good cheer is habitual with those which are poorly fed, covering the entire social scale. He also considered the various quarters of Paris with one another according to their wealth, for it is well known that wide divergencies exist in this respect.\n\nThe most interesting section, however, is the discussion of restaurants near the book’s conclusion. Restaurants in the modern sense were a relatively recent innovation, appearing in Paris in the latter half of the eighteenth century and quickly spreading throughout Europe and beyond during the French Empire’s warring efforts.\n\nThe Spirit of the Age: Or, Contemporary Portraits\n\nAuthor: William Hazlitt\n\nLink: WikiSource\n\nThe conservative reaction to the French Revolution dampened liberal attitudes around the turn of the nineteenth century. This collection of essays captures this milieu through portraits of several prominent British figures, from philosophers to poets to MPs.\n\nSelf-portrait circa 1802\n\nOutside of a few characters depicted as the embodiment of tyranny and injustice such the Tory MP Lord Eldon, Hazlitt’s general assessment is that each figure’s early work is superior to their later work due to their abandonment of liberal principles. Hazlitt is particularly critical in this regard to the Lake Poets.\n\nIn short bursts, Hazlitt’s style is engaging. The opening salvo sharply critiques Jeremy Bentham’s philosophical project as fantasy and navel-gazing. The discussion of Coleridge’s intellectual adventures demonstrates the breadth of Hazlitt’s interests. The profiles of various MPs give insight into the position of the intellectual in the political realm.\n\nWhen read together, however, this collection grates on one’s mind. Hazlitt has a tendency to juxtapose figures and ideas as diametric opposites. For example, the article on long-time Edinburgh Review editor Francis Jeffrey contrasts the Whig-friendly Edinburgh Review with the Tory Quarterly Review. All that is right with the world is attributed to the Edinburgh and all the muck given to the Quarterly. To be fair, the Edinburgh Review is the better magazine in my estimation; yet, both are inferior to the Westminster.\n\nHazlitt by William Bewick (1825)\n\nHazlitt can stretch his credibility to the point of becoming an unreliable narrator. The article on Walter Scott criticizes his conservative overtones through romanticizing the past; yet, when comparing Scott with Lord Byron, Hazlitt holds the former to be the greatest moralist of the age and the latter a phony liberal.\n\nI most enjoyed the essays on Walter Scott, William Godwin, Horne Tooke, and James MacKintosh. I knew of Scott as the author of Waverley, the philosopher Godwin only as father to Mary Shelley, but was unaware of the interesting MPs: the jurist Tooke and the Scottish philosopher MacKintosh.\n\nPhilosophical Considerations on the Sciences and Savants\n\nAuthor: Auguste Comte\n\nTranslated by Henry Dix Hutton (1877)\n\nFrench Title: Considérations philosophiques sur la science et les savants\n\nPublication: Le Producteur\n\nLink: Internet Archive\n\nAuguste Comte is a often presented as one of the villains in the history of social thought. Similar to Wittgenstein, there is the early Comte and the later Comte. The early Comte is interested in the history of thought and intellectual development and is often associated with the six volume Course of Positive Philosophy (1830-1842). It’s the later Comte associated with the System of Positive Polity (1851-1854) and his religion of humanity that is much reviled.\n\nIn this article, Comte introduces his law of three stages and the hierarchy of the sciences. The former holds that human intellectual development passes through three stages: theological, metaphysical, and positive. Theological thought is all encompassing and often anthropomorphized, attributing phenomena to supernatural beings. This mode of thought is rigid and allows little room for change. Metaphysical thought is still spooky but less centralized, allowing for the possibility of change. Positive thought is empirical, scientific, and decentralized and seeks to explain phenomena through general laws.\n\nComte argues that the sciences can be categorized into a hierarchy beginning with the natural sciences up through the social sciences, similar to other attempts to explain the unity of science. Fields of study in the hierarchy progress from bottom up with some fields being scientific while others are still spooky at a given time. In the early nineteenth century, physics and astronomy attained the status of a positive science, while the moral sciences were still largely theological and metaphysical, being dominated by Medieval theology and eighteenth century Enlightenment thought.\n\nThis leads to an interesting critique of encyclopedias and the organization of knowledge. Comte argues that such projects are only feasible once human thought has sufficiently developed; otherwise, two adjacent fields at different stages of development may offer mutually exclusive explanations for the same phenomena.\n\nThe article concludes with sketching a history of intellectual development. Early societies were theocracies, typified by Egypt, where there was no distinction between priest, philosopher, and state authority. Ancient Greece represented the transition to metaphysics with the distinction of the philosopher from the priest. This is illustrated by the differing philosophical attitudes of Plato and Aristotle. An antagonism between science and theology developed as they butted heads on social issues. Several attempts to reconcile the two under the auspices of theology e.g. by the Jesuits were at best temporarily successful. What remains is to create a social physics i.e. a positive social science. This, in turn, would lead to a reorganization of society in the hands of technocrats.\n\nMathematics\n\nOn the method of the least squares\n\nAuthor: James Ivory\n\nPublication: Philosophical Magazine\n\nLink: T&F Online\n\nLeast squares is an estimation method that fits a line to a set of points that minimizes the sum of the squared distances from the points to the line and is a workhorse in statistics and machine learning. This method was introduced by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805 as a heuristic to correct for measurement error in astronomical data. Aside from an independent investigation from Robert Adrain in 1808, Carl Gauss and Pierre-Simon Laplace offered the first justifications for least squares in important publications from 1809 and 1810, where Gauss derived the normal distribution and Laplace proved the central limit theorem.\n\nIvory’s paper offers a few justifications for least squares and frames the problem in terms of reducing error from astronomical observations. Ivory begins by critiquing an approach from the early eighteenth century by Roger Cotes that correctly observed that averaging multiple noisy observations decreases error. The first two justifications are the most clearly developed. The first employs an analogy with levers and fulcrums to represent how each observation is weighted. The second is more reasonable and argues that least squares is principled and minimizes mean squared error.\n\nIvory received the Copley Medal\n\nfrom the Royal Society in 1814\n\nIvory is an interesting and tragic historical character. He was a Scottish mathematician of the first order and a chief exponent of the continental approach to analysis and mechanics and one of the first in Britain to use Leibniz’s notation for the differential and integral calculus. Despite receiving several awards from the Royal Society and even being knighted, Ivory was plagued by delusion and paranoia, which limited his contributions and resulted in controversies with other big names of the time.\n\nOn the Nature of the Function Expressive of the Law of Human Mortality, and on a New Mode of Determining the Value of Life Contingencies\n\nAuthor: Benjamin Gompertz\n\nPublication: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London\n\nLink: JSTOR\n\nImagine you’re trying to determine whether or not a life insurance policy or an annuity is priced fairly. How might you go about this? A reasonable place to start is collecting data on how long people live and calculating a contingency table or an empirical distribution. Even if this sample is representative, this approach has several drawbacks, e.g., the estimated distribution is discrete and making the distribution more fine-grained comes at the cost of higher variance estimates. Calculating the present value of an instrument from a discrete distribution can be computationally expensive (especially using methods from the early nineteenth century).\n\nAn interpolated empirical distribution of\n\nmortality rates (log scale) in the US in 2003.\n\nGompertz proposes a model for the mortality rate at age $x$ ($\\mu_x$) that increases exponentially with age, now called the Gompertz Law of Mortality. In symbols, $\\mu_x = Bc^x$, where $x$ is age, $B$ is the baseline mortality rate, and $c > 1$ is the acceleration of mortality. Much of the paper shows that the proposed model closely approximates various datasets for adulthood, except at very old age. This model provides several benefits. Being a continuous time model, calculating probabilities is as simple as integrating the mortality rate over the desired age range. Moreover, the estimation problem is reduced to two parameters $B$ and $c$ rather than the full empirical distribution.\n\nWhile some may view life insurance as a bit of a morbid topic, Gompertz doubles down on the macabre by describing his model of the mortality rate as “a deterioration, or an increased inability to withstand destruction”.\n\nInternational Relations\n\nA Review of the Efforts and Progress of Nations during the Last Twenty-Five Years\n\nAuthor: J. C. L. de Sismondi\n\nPublication: Revue Encyclopédique\n\nTranslated by Peter Stephen Du Ponceau in The Port Folio (1825)\n\nLink: HathiTrust\n\nThe period from the late eighteenth to the early nineteenth century was the age of revolutions. From Europe to the Americas and Africa, monarchies became less absolute - in some cases even overthrown - and power and wealth became more dispersed.\n\nAn ink portrait of Sismondi\n\nfrom the Online Library of Liberty\n\nIn this review, Sismondi surveys revolutions the world over. He characterizes this period as a conflict between two opposing forces: one pushing in the direction of Enlightenment ideas and greater individual liberty, and the other toward greater concentration of power. The former is the wave emanating from the overthrow of the ancien régime in France, and the latter is the conservative reaction.\n\nIndividual political movements run the gamut between these extremes; however, Sismondi identifies some patterns to help make sense of the aftermath. When revolutions come from within and capture the elusive public opinion, they tend to favor greater liberty and enfranchisement. In contrast, revolutions brought about by external actors tend to concentrate power, often in the hands of those same actors. Overall, however, the world is trending toward greater liberty and prosperity.\n\nA review in the North American Review takes issue with some of Sismondi’s claims. Sismondi overplays the success of Enlightenment ideas in France; however, this is understandable, since Sismondi had to get his publication approved by the French censors. On the other hand, Sismondi underplays the success of such adoption elsewhere in Western Europe such as Germany and Italy. Perhaps, this was motivated by national rivalry. While I read Sismondi as relatively optimistic about Enlightenment ideals prevailing, the reviewer is even more so.\n\nLetter to Mrs. Wheeler\n\nAuthor: William Thompson\n\nLink: Google Books\n\nThis letter to the political writer Anna Doyle Wheeler acts as the preface to Thompson’s Appeal of One Half of the Human Race. Thompson begins the letter by attributing the ideas proffered in the book as the joint product of himself and Wheeler. The core argument is that the position of women in society and the laws restricting their political rights are not only unjust but are suboptimal from an utilitarian perspective. By denying women education, political participation, and economic independence, society is squandering a vast reservoir of talent and potential.\n\nAnna Wheeler c.1825\n\nThis book is directly responding to a passage discussing representative democracy in James Mill’s Essay on Government for the Supplement to the Encyclopedia Britannica. Mill argues that, since subgroups of the population can represent the broader interest of the people, we should not extend political rights to women. This is a bit baffling to read, since Mill is a radical arguing for liberal reforms, and certainly rubs me the wrong way. I’m glad a response on this point exists! While I found it dragged on too long, this opening letter is a strong hook for the remainder of the book.\n\nMisc\n\nNew University in London\n\nPublication: Edinburgh Review\n\nLink: Google Books\n\nSince the eleventh century, Oxford and Cambridge were the only universities in England. With rise of the working class during the first industrial revolution, the early nineteenth century saw the founding of Mechanics’ Institutes and mutual improvement societies. In the 1820s and 1830s, several candidates popped up for a third university in England to meet the demand for education. This unsigned article discusses and advertises the founding of London University, now called University College London.\n\n\"The London University\" by\n\nThomas H. Shepherd (1828)\n\nWhile the two university system may have made sense during the Middle Ages, the author argues that it is no longer the case. As the demand for education increased, Oxford and Cambridge were scarcely able to take on more students. The cost of attendance for room and board, tutors, and religious services were exorbitant and priced out many would-be students, an evergreen complaint. Without competition within England, educational standards had stagnated and not kept up with recent advances in knowledge. Moreover, the author cautions that sending young men far from home during their formative years is a recipe for debauchery.\n\nLondon seems to be a natural fit for a university. Not only is it home to the Royal Society with its large pool of potential professors, but it has ample hospitals to justify a medical school. The author closes by advising that the proposed university was still raising funds. London University would open the next year in 1826."}

Attention has already turned to who will succeed him. But anyone who claims to know who the next pope will be is just speculating. Even the most savvy and knowledgeable expert can’t offer more—thanks to the secretive nature of the selection process. For roughly 750 years, the College of Cardinals has chosen popes at closed conclaves where participants are locked in and completely cut off from the outside world. Every cardinal and anyone else involved in the sealed conclave—there are a small number of cooks, medical staff, and clerical support locked in with the electors—takes a vow of secrecy never to talk about what happened without a pope’s permission. The penalty for violating this pledge is the church’s most severe punishment: excommunication, or being permanently separated from the life of the church.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nEven after a pope is chosen, we rarely get verifiable insight into the deliberations. Looking for patterns is also difficult because papal conclaves are so rare. While, for example, there have been 60 American presidential elections since 1788, there have only been 16 papal conclaves during that period. And perhaps the only lesson from these 16 choices is to expect the unexpected. For the first millennium of Christianity, the Catholic Church selected popes in one of two fashions. Either a cheering Roman crowd picked Catholics’ next spiritual leader, or a group of local clergy and powerful families got together and made a choice. The locked conclave did not become the method for papal selection until the 13th century. The process changed because the cardinals infuriated the people of Viterbo, Italy by taking nearly three years to choose a successor to Pope Clement IV, who had died in their town. At that time, there were not many cardinals so they tended to travel with the pope and elected a successor wherever the prior pope had died. The fed up laypeople finally locked the cardinals up in an effort to hasten the process. The tactic worked. The cardinals quickly made a selection once they were behind lock and key.\n\nRead More: What Happens to the Leadership of the Catholic Church When a Pope Is Sick or Incapacitated? Their choice, Gregory X, thought he’d learn from a good example. In 1274, the church added the conclave into the official rules for papal selection: henceforth, cardinals would be locked up until they chose the next Catholic leader. Yet, deciding in secret didn’t originally mean the total secrecy that characterizes modern conclaves. In the Vatican archives, the church historian Frederic J. Baumgartner discovered vote tallies from the early modern conclaves. By 1800, however, church leaders decided that they should burn all ballots and notes from conclaves. Pope Pius VI had died as Napoleon’s prisoner and the cardinals were trying to protect the church’s independence. Some of the cardinals didn’t want their local government officials to know how they’d voted during an era of shifting national alliances. Over time, this practice led to a new tradition: the cardinals would burn the ballots with substances to make the smoke black to indicate no pope was elected and white to indicate success.\n\nIn the 16 more secretive conclaves since 1800, one pattern has emerged: more often than not, the choices typically don’t come from the bandied-about names of papabili (literally, “pope-able”). It’s in fact rare for that to happen: In 1963, Vatican watchers were pretty sure the conclave would select Milan’s Cardinal Giovanni Montini, and that’s precisely what happened: he became Paul VI. The saying “he who enters the conclave as pope leaves as a cardinal” was wrong in this case. But 1963 was an exception. That became clear when Paul VI died in 1978—the year of three popes. The conclave to replace him chose Cardinal Albino Luciani, who took the hybrid name John Paul I. In a shock, he died a month later (likely of a heart attack). That meant a second conclave, and this time the cardinals chose a name on nobody’s radar: Krakow’s Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, who took the name John Paul II. At least in this case, one cardinal kept his vow of silence about how that came about. “I would like to tell you everything. It would thrill you,” said St. Louis’s Cardinal John Carberry. “But I can’t.”\n\nThe second 1978 gathering proved to be the last conclave of the 20th century. John Paul II remained pope until his death in 2005. Given his 27-year tenure, observers expected the cardinals to replace John Paul II with an older successor. There was a sense that another very lengthy papacy was too much. Additionally, the final years of John Paul II’s papacy had been crushed by Parkinson’s disease. There was a real need for someone with administrative skills. The curia—the Vatican’s bureaucracy— was in terrible shape and it would take someone who knew how things worked to fix it. That person ended up being the German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who had run the Vatican’s doctrinal office with a firm hand for almost all of John Paul II’s papacy. Nevertheless, Ratzinger’s name appeared on very few papabili lists and when it did, it was quite low, likely because he was considered a bit too old at 78. That meant his election as Benedict XVI was both surprising and unsuprising.\n\nRead More: Cover Story: The September Pope Yet, he didn’t wrangle the curia into efficiency, and a great desire for change percolated among the cardinals. When Benedict XVI unexpectedly resigned in 2013, what followed was something like the second 1978 conclave, which produced a choice on almost no one’s list. Perhaps that wouldn’t have been the case had observers had more insight into the 2005 conclave, which we’ve gotten from whispers and hints in memoirs and interviews. Some cardinals have stepped very close to the line of breaking their vow of secrecy—or even broken it behind the cloak of anonymity. One kept a secret diary and shared it with an Italian journalist. That diary indicated that while Ratzinger always led the vote in the 2005 conclave, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires had roughly 40 votes, nowhere near the required two-thirds majority of the 115 electors, but a substantial number nonetheless. Perhaps he was too abrupt a break from John Paul II at that moment, so the cardinals made the safe choice with Ratzinger, whose papacy proved to be a coda to that of his predecessor.\n\nBut the 2013 conclave returned to Bergoglio, who became Pope Francis, demonstrating that there is such a thing as a second act in conclave politics.\n\nSome have argued that Francis has loaded the college of cardinals with his men to ensure his agenda will continue after he is gone. Yet, in truth, Pope Francis simply did what every other pope (or monarch, world leader, or even CEO) would do: surrounded himself with like-minded people. Historically, that hasn’t guaranteed a like-minded successor, as demonstrated by the choice of the Polish John Paul II after 455 years of Italian popes, and the selection of the decentralizing Francis after 35 years of more monarchical papacies.\n\nHistory doesn’t offer a specific pattern to help observers predict the conclave set to take place. It seems logical that the conclave may opt for the second consecutive pope from south of the Equator, where the church is flourishing, rather than north where it is faltering. But as past conclaves have illustrated, frequently the choice is unexpected. That’s the final lesson of studying the history of conclaves.\n\nChristopher M.

All they had to do was assign people to work on a new web development project based on the client's budget and the team's availability. But the staffer soon ran into an unexpected problem: They couldn't dismiss an innocuous pop-up blocking files that contained relevant information.\n\n\"Could you help me access the files directly?\" they texted Chen Xinyi, the firm's human resources manager. Ignoring the obvious \"X\" button in the pop-up's top right corner, Xinyi offered to connect them with IT support.\n\n\"IT should be in touch with you shortly to resolve these access issues,\" Xinyi texted back. But they never contacted IT, and the new hire never followed up. The task was left uncompleted.\n\nFortunately, none of these employees are real. They were part of a virtual simulation designed to test how AI agents fare in real-world professional scenarios. Set up by a group of Carnegie Mellon University researchers, the simulation mimicked the trappings of a small software company with internal websites, a Slack-like chat program, an employee handbook, and designated bots — an HR manager and chief technology officer — to contact for help. Inside the fake company called TheAgentCompany, an autonomous agent can browse the web, write code, organize information in spreadsheets, and communicate with coworkers.\n\nAgents have emerged as the next major frontier of generative AI as Google, Amazon, OpenAI, and every other major tech company race to build them. Instead of executing one-off instructions like a chatbot would, agents can independently act on a person's behalf, make decisions on the go, and perform in unfamiliar environments with little to no intervention. If ChatGPT can suggest a few vacuum cleaners to buy, its agentic counterpart theoretically could pick one and buy it for you.\n\nNaturally, the promise of AI agents has captivated CEOs. In a Deloitte survey of over 2,500 C-suite leaders, more than one-quarter of respondents said their organizations were exploring autonomous agents to a \"large or very large extent.\" Earlier this year, Salesforce's chief said today's CEOs will lead the last all-human workforces. Nvidia's cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang predicted every company's IT department will soon \"be the HR department of AI agents.\" OpenAI's Sam Altman has said that this year, AI agents will \"join the workforce.\" But it's still unclear how well these agents can accomplish the tasks a company might need them to.\n\nTo test this out, the Carnegie Mellon researchers instructed artificial intelligence models from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to complete tasks a real employee might carry out in fields such as finance, administration, and software engineering. In one, the AI had to navigate through several files to analyze a coffee shop chain's databases. In another, it was asked to collect feedback on a 36-year-old engineer and write a performance review. Some tasks challenged the models' visual capabilities: One required the models to watch video tours of prospective new office spaces and pick the one with the best health facilities.\n\nThe results weren't great: The top-performing model, Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, finished a little less than one-quarter of all tasks. The rest, including Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash and the one that powers ChatGPT, completed about 10% of the assignments. There wasn't a single category in which the AI agents accomplished the majority of the tasks, says Graham Neubig, a computer science professor at CMU and one of the study's authors. The findings, along with other emerging research about AI agents, complicate the idea that an AI agent workforce is just around the corner — there's a lot of work they simply aren't good at. But the research does offer a glimpse into the specific ways AI agents could revolutionize the workplace.\n\nTwo years ago, OpenAI released a widely discussed study that said professions like financial analysts, administrators, and researchers are most likely to be replaced by AI. But the study based its conclusions on what humans and large language models said were likely to be automated — without measuring whether LLM agents could actually do those jobs. The Carnegie Mellon team wanted to fill that gap with a benchmark linked directly to real-world utility.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nIn many scenarios, the AI agents in the study started well, but as tasks became more complex, they ran into issues due to their lack of common sense, social skills, or technical abilities. For example, when prompted to paste its responses to questions in \"answer.docx,\" the AI treated it as a plain text file and couldn't add its answers to the document. Agents also routinely misinterpreted conversations with colleagues or wouldn't follow up on key directions, prematurely marking the task complete.\n\nIt's relatively easy to teach them to be nice conversational partners; it's harder to teach them to do everything a human employee can.\n\nOther studies have similarly concluded that AI cannot keep up with multilayered jobs: One found that AI cannot yet flexibly navigate changing environments, and another found agents struggle to perform at human levels when overwhelmed by tools and instructions.\n\n\"While agents may be used to accelerate some portion of the tasks that human workers are doing, they are likely not a replacement for all tasks at the moment,\" Neubig says.\n\nThe Carnegie Mellon study was far from a perfect simulation of how agents would work in the wild. Most proponents of agents envision them working in tandem with a human who could help course-correct if the AI ran into an obvious roadblock. The generation of agents that was studied is also not that skilled at carrying out humanlike tasks such as browsing the web. Newer tools, like OpenAI's Operator, will likely be more adept at these tasks.\n\nDespite these limitations, the research offers something valuable: It points to what's coming next.\n\nStephen Casper, an AI researcher who was part of the MIT team that developed the first public database of deployed agentic systems, says agents are \"ridiculously overhyped in their capabilities.\" He says the main reason AI agents struggle to accomplish real-world tasks reliably is that \"it is challenging to train them to do so.\" Most state-of-the-art AI systems are decent chatbots because it's relatively easy to teach them to be nice conversational partners; it's harder to teach them to do everything a human employee can.\n\nIn TheAgentCompany, AI succeeded the most in software development tasks, even though those are more difficult for humans. The researchers hypothesize this is because there's an abundance of publicly available training data for programming jobs, while workflows for admin and financial tasks are typically kept private within companies. There just isn't great data to train an AI on.\n\nJeff Clune, a computer science professor at the University of British Columbia who helped build an agent for OpenAI that could use computer software like a human, thinks that training AI agents on proprietary data from day-to-day activities and workflow patterns could be the key to improving their efficacy. That's exactly what a lot of companies are starting to do.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nMoody's is one of many major companies experimenting with training AI on in-house data. The 116-year-old financial services firm is automating business analysis through agentic AI systems, which draw insights from decades of research, ratings, articles, and macroeconomic information. The training is designed to emulate how a human team would analyze a business, using carefully crafted instructions broken into independent steps by people experienced in the field.\n\nWhile it's too early to tell how effective Moody's approach is, its managing director of AI, Sergio Gago, says the firm is actively exploring what kinds of work — like analyzing the financials of a small business — agents could take over.\n\nSimilarly, Johnson & Johnson tells Business Insider it was able to cut production time for the chemical processes behind making new drugs by 50% with fine-tuned in-house AI agents that could automatically adjust factors like temperature and pressure. Jim Swanson, J&J's chief information officer, says the company is focused on training people to collaborate with AI agents.\n\nThe direction things are heading looks different from what most people thought a few years ago.\n\nJohns Hopkins scientists have created an Agent Laboratory, which leverages LLMs to automate much of the research process, from literature review to report writing, with human-provided ideas and feedback at each stage. \"I think it won't be long before we trust AI for autonomous discovery,\" Samuel Schmidgall, one of the Johns Hopkins scientists, says. Likewise, LG Group's AI research division developed an AI agent that it says can verify datasets' licenses and dependencies 45 times faster than a team of human experts and lawyers.\n\nIt's still unclear whether organizations can trust AI enough to automate their operations. In multiple studies, AI agents attempted to deceive and hack to accomplish their goals. In some tests with TheAgentCompany, when an agent was confused about the next steps, it created nonexistent shortcuts. During one task, an agent couldn't find the right person to speak with on the chat tool and decided to create a user with the same name, instead. A BI investigation from November found that Microsoft's flagship AI assistant, Copilot, faced similar struggles: Only 3% of IT leaders surveyed in October by the management consultancy Gartner said Copilot \"provided significant value to their companies.\"\n\nBusinesses also remain concerned about being held responsible for their agents' mistakes. Plus, copyright and other intellectual property infringements could prove a legal nightmare for organizations down the road, says Thomas Davenport, an IT and management professor at Babson College and a senior advisor at Deloitte Analytics.\n\nBut the direction things are heading looks different from what most people thought a few years ago. When AI first took off, a lot of jobs seemed to be on the chopping block. Journalists, writers, and administrators were all at the top of the list. So far, though, AI agents have had a hard time navigating a maze of complex tools — something critical to any admin job. And they lack the social skills crucial to journalism or anything HR-related.\n\nNeubig takes the translation market as a precedent. Despite machine language translation becoming so accessible and accurate — putting translators at the top of the list for job cuts — the number of people working in the industry in the US has remained rather steady. A \"Planet Money\" analysis of Census Bureau data found that the number of interpreters and translators grew 11% between 2020 and 2023. \"Any efficiency gains resulted in increased demand, increasing the total size of the market for language services,\" Neubig says. He thinks that AI's impact on other sectors will follow a similar trajectory.\n\nEven the companies seeing massive success with AI agents are, for now, keeping humans in the loop. Many, like J&J, aren't yet prepared to look past AI's risks and are focused on training staff to use it as a tool. \"When used responsibly, we see AI agents as powerful complements to our people,\" Swanson says.\n\nInstead of being replaced by robots, we're all slowly turning into cyborgs.\n\nShubham Agarwal is a freelance technology journalist from Ahmedabad, India, whose work has appeared in Wired, The Verge, Fast Company, and more."}

Intel has yet to formally announce the technology, but the company’s announcement was spoiled by its partners, including Gigabyte, and by Tom’s Hardware, who obtained leaked firmware to test the new tool.\n\nEditor’s Note: Intel has confirmed that the 200S Boost technology is now officially available.\n\nAccording to Hot Hardware, the 200S Boost technology requires a Core Ultra 9 285K, a Core Ultra 7 265K or 265KF, or a 245K/KF chip; a qualified motherboard with an Intel Z890 chipset; and 8,000 MT/s RAM with an XMP profile. Although Hot Hardware suggests that all Z890 motherboards should be able to take advantage of the 200S Boost feature, not all will include the necessary optimizations to do so.\n\nWhat the new Core 200S Boost feature does is simply overclock the chip’s memory and fabric speeds rather than adjust the clock speeds or power settings, Tom’s Hardware reports. Specifically, the NGU/SA fabric is now clocked at 3.2 GHz (up from 2.6 GHz) and the die-to-die communication fabric is now also clocked at 3.2 GHz (up from 2.1 GHz). The fact that Intel is doing this while still preserving its warranty coverage is somewhat remarkable.\n\nIntel confirmed that the 200S Boost option is live, and offered the following detailed description below of what it does:\n\nWhether or not you’ll be able to get Intel’s Core 200S Boost technology, however, is up to your motherboard manufacturer. When (if) they release a BIOS update for your board to include the new feature, you’ll need to go to any overclocking options provided by the BIOS and enable the new 200S Boost overclocking upgrade.\n\nMSI, for example, offered this configuration guide below:\n\nAccording to Intel, “the Intel 200S Boost overclocking profile is designed for one stick of Intel XMP memory per channel (“1DPC”) with memory speeds up to 8000 MT/s,” the company said. UDIMMs and CUDIMMs are both eligible. Modules from ADATA, Corsair, G.Skill, TeamGroup and V-Color have been tested for the 200S Boost technology.\n\nIntel also listed some of the motherboards that have been tested to support 200S Boost. The company said that the list may not include others that have been tested to the 200S Boost specification.\n\nIntel’s Arrow Lake-S desktop processors emphasized lower power, but at “parity” performance for games and an overall geomean that was expected to be lower than Intel’s 14th-gen parts. A “free” boost might not be able to make up that lack, but it’s an improvement."}

While there’s still more to do (always is), this is the version we’ve imagined—rebuilt from the ground up, new look, streamlined (and consistent) experience throughout!\n\nEvery WP template has been reworked, simplified, and redundant pages removed. We’ve added fun new ways to customise your reading experience, save and share your favourite projects, explore metadata, and navigate the CAN Archive with interactive visualisations. You can now generate shareable images of your favorite projects, filter views your way, and browse faster with a (smart and fast) quick search.\n\nMost importantly, articles are no longer locked behind a login. Anyone with a direct link can now read and share the work archived on CAN—spanning over 16 years of innovation, creativity and collaboration.\n\nSo, where are all these things, the details, and what is next for CAN?\n\nCleanup New look, building on the we have done in the past, slightly little retro with the all-new tech.\n\nWordPress theme rebuilt from ground up. Not a single template hasn’t been re-touched/re-done and optimised.\n\nRemoved redundant pages, eg no more jobs archive or job-board, dashboard, it’s just php/javascript/css magic in the template files.\n\nMember Dashboard is now in the sidebar when you login. Find latest entries / submissions / saved / discord are all there.\n\nWe have reduced the number template dependencies by 50%, meaning more consistency throughout.\n\nCategories have been revamped, reduced to 10, most projects now attributed to projects category. Previous categories such as games, robotics are now tags.\n\ncategory. Previous categories such as games, robotics are now tags. Simplified top menu, just the things that are important. Features Customisation in feeds (home/filter/search). Have them how you like, grid / list / excerpts / meta / titles… saves your preference.\n\nTools and People now have new viz included.\n\nSuper-fast quick search in the header (hit return for full search).\n\nMetadata in home / archive / search rebuilt now with some Chart.js goodness.\n\nSave your favorite projects and share them without restrictions. Buld lists, clear, start anew.\n\nFeatured members, on the front page.\n\nMember submissions are now treated the same as contributions/all other entries.\n\nNew Chart.js archive browser on the /Archives page. Way faster and more friendly than the p5js version we built ages ago.\n\nShare articles, text or generate image.\n\nLocations – add your location to see other members in your city. You need to update your profile for this to work. See also map on /community.\n\nNew p5js (refreshed) logo in the footer\n\nYou can now use Switches to hide titles, excerpts or metadata. You can also turn all the thumbnails into black and white. All of this is accesible from the sub menu and applied to the front page, archives, profiles, authors and tool pages. Your preference is stored in your browser localStorage. Metadata is a powerful tool to see the relationships between people, projects, tags and tools. This section shows you all the data combined for the current view, ie how many projects are being displayed. Clicking on the next page will reload these for that next collection of projects. Dig deeper into taxonomy by choosing one of the tags / tools / people / authors. Saved is an amazing (but simple) way to share projects on CAN. In addition to just keeping a collection of projects for yourself, you can also share them as lists with your friends, or on social media. Access to those articles is unrestricted so anyone can read and enjoy them regardless of whether they are logged in or not. Great for sharing with students/clients. In addition to copying simple name, year and url of the article, you can now also generate an image to use on social media or for yourself. Simply click on ‘image’ link and we will generate the image for you (all done with php). Resolution of these images matches perfectly the size of Live stories on Instagram so easy to share in your feeds.\n\nTaxonomies\n\nTaxonomies are the new backbone of CAN. Over the last year we have re-catalogued most of the articles on CAN and rebuilt existing and applied new taxonomies. Taxonomies are what holds everything together on CAN, tells stories of craft, determination and innovation in our field and beyond.\n\nWith the advent of AI, authorship and craft are being erased, and we believe it has become critical to highlight detail and care that goes both in the making of these tools and their application ( people ). One place where we have tried to do this the most are People and Tools revamped pages. Our most recent taxonomy Tools, is growing daily, and is a fantastic way to get to know CAN. Note the new additions, Air , Liquid , Concrete , treated just the same as Raspberry-Pi or Houdini . Note the visualisations acomaning these taxonomies, made available by parsing the data available which is available for anyone to use. There is only more to come..\n\nNew People Visualization shows the relationships between different people when they worked together on projects (mentioned together in articles). Its a fun way to navigate CAN archives and selecting a name will automaticly filter names above. An option for Connections allows you to show only those with most connections vs everyone. Changing it to Everyone will show also People without connection –– solo projects. On the Tools page you will also find a new visualization that shows the relationship between different People via the tools they use. The connections occur when the person is associated (used) that tool. You can manipulate the density here, for example 1/3 showing only a third of the people on CAN. Changing it to 1/1 will show all the 2k+ people featured on CAN since 2008.\n\nAccess\n\nArticles are no longer locked. If you have a direct URL, you can read it (logged-in or not). This means that anyone can also share articles with everyone else. This has been something we wanted to do for a very long time and finally found a good way to do it. What is managed (gated) is the way you get to those articles (archives > 2 years) but not the articles themselves. If you are a Member, you can make any article available to everyone by simply sharing the URL directly or via the Saved feature. It has always been important to us that as many people as possible have access to CAN content. Amazing work has been done in the last 16 years, too easily forgotten, then repeated, but now accesible to all.\n\nMore\n\nIn case you missed other announcements over the last few months, there have been a heap of features we already added to CAN that are just as much part of V6. Members now have access to Full Content RSS Feed , a new Discord server, Tags have been optimised from 6,000 to 1,800, new Community page, new Books section bringing you latest releases and important literature. If you teach, and are a CAN Member, you can now also create educational accounts for your students. CAN Data (CSV) is now also available to build visualisations and understand CAN archive better. So much has been done in the last year but equally there is still so much left to do, especially in the area of thematic taxonomies and past projects not yet documented on CAN.\n\nWorld map of CAN Members – Please add your location (City) to your profile.\n\nFutures\n\nEarlier this year we also launched our annual call for support where we shared our 2025 roadmap. We are four months into the year and jumped on the V6 in a leap of faith for your support. We are extremly grateful for the support we have recieved from our Members over the years but moving forward, much of what we do next will depend on whether we can reach our goal or not. There are so many things we still want to do with CAN, but we desperately need your support.\n\nIf you are not a CAN Member already, you can support us in two ways: by becoming one or by donating. With the individual membership priced at only $20 per year, billed annually, you unlock plenty of features available only to Members. Alternatively, with a donation directly to CAN, you are aiding us in keeping this platform and community alive, and thriving, for years to come.\n\nThank you! ♥︎"}

What works today may well not work a month from now.\n\nUnderstanding GEO\n\nGenerative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the emerging field of optimization for AI search. This includes optimizing to appear in Google’s AI Overviews, Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok, and others.\n\nThis field is evolving rapidly, meaning that tactics used today may not work in a year.\n\nHere are a few examples of how quickly generative AI evolves, according to a key benchmark analysis by Ithy about OpenAI’s o1 to o3 models.\n\nMathematical reasoning: AIME 2024 benchmark accuracy rose from 83.3% to 96.7%, a 13.4% improvement.\n\nAIME 2024 benchmark accuracy rose from 83.3% to 96.7%, a 13.4% improvement. Scientific reasoning: Using the GPQA Diamond Benchmark, ChatGPT’s “o3 scored 87.7% accuracy compared to o1’s 78.0%, demonstrating a stronger capacity to handle complex, PhD-level science questions with greater precision and depth.”\n\nUsing the GPQA Diamond Benchmark, ChatGPT’s “o3 scored 87.7% accuracy compared to o1’s 78.0%, demonstrating a stronger capacity to handle complex, PhD-level science questions with greater precision and depth.” Coding: ChatGPT has significantly improved from o1 to o3, with o3 “achieving a 71.7% accuracy rate, a significant increase from the o1 model’s 48.9%.”\n\nThis means that, in the long term, hacking the system simply won’t be cost-effective. Any hack you uncover will have a very limited shelf life.\n\nInstead, we should turn to a tried and true tactic from SEO: aligning consensus.\n\nWhat Is Consensus, And How Do You Align With It?\n\nPut simply, consensus is when a variety of high-quality sources align on a topic.\n\nFor example, if you ask Google if the earth is round or flat, the resulting snippet will tell you it is round because the vast majority of high-quality sources agree on this fact.\n\nThe highest-ranking results will be sites that agree with this consensus, while results that don’t align rank poorly.\n\nAI search works in much the same way. It can identify the general consensus on a topic and use this consensus to decide which information is most relevant to a user’s search intent.\n\nBuilding Consensus Through PR\n\nSo, then, building consensus is key for GEO. But, how can you help build consensus?\n\nThe answer is through the use of experts.\n\nHow Experts Build Consensus\n\nLet’s take an example from Mark Cuban, a financial expert and Florida resident.\n\nWhen discussing the topic of the housing crisis in Florida on the platform Bluesky, he stated that a major issue is the affordability of home insurance.\n\nThis, was then cited by a variety of articles on sites like GoBankingRates.\n\nFurther articles may then also cite this article, perhaps bringing in other experts to comment.\n\nSoon, a consensus forms: Florida’s housing crisis is due at least in part to homeowners’ insurance rates. And if we ask Google this question, the AI snippet reflects just that.\n\nPositioning Expertise To Build Consensus\n\nEven a single expert’s opinion can have a major impact on consensus, especially for smaller, more niche topics.\n\nThe important thing to keep in mind is consensus cannot be faked.\n\nBuilding consensus requires convincing people. And to convince people, you’ll need to establish your expertise and credibility and get a conversation going to establish consensus on a topic.\n\nIn other words, you’ll need:\n\nCredible expertise.\n\nHigh-quality data or insights.\n\nEnough coverage or references across the web to establish that your viewpoint is widely accepted (or at least seriously considered) by other experts.\n\nSay you want to build consensus around the idea that the best way to pay off debts is to prioritize debts with the highest interest rates.\n\nBy publishing original research that shows this to be true, backed by the voice of an established expert, you can start a conversation on this topic.\n\nAs further blog posts and online conversations reference your data, your position will gain greater reach. Then, more experts may comment on it and agree with it, over time building that consensus on the topic.\n\nThen, when somebody goes to research the topic with AI search, the AI will find that consensus you’ve built.\n\nConsider the case of blue light.\n\nIn 2015, the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine published a study:\n\n“Evening use of light-emitting eReaders negatively affects sleep, circadian timing, and next-morning alertness.”\n\nThis study showed that exposure to blue light suppresses melatonin production, leading to delayed sleep onset and reduced sleep quality.\n\nThis research was then cited by experts and major outlets before gaining traction on social media and blogs.\n\nNow, if you AI search “Does blue light affect sleep?” you’ll be given this information (that blue light affects sleep), and it will cite this original research and the websites and experts who wrote about it.\n\nCollaboration For Building Consensus\n\nOf course, you don’t have to simply wait for a conversation to find its way to other experts. By collaborating directly, you can amplify the establishment of a consensus.\n\nLet’s take the same example as before. But, this time, we make a small change: Instead of authoring studies or guest posts solo, we do so in collaboration with another established expert.\n\nIn doing so, you can essentially “hijack” your collaborator’s authority and audience:\n\nTheir followers will become aware of your research.\n\nTheir peers and fellow experts are more likely to consider your findings.\n\nMedia outlets also view collaborations as more credible than a single, lesser-known source, further boosting your reach.\n\nTake the example of David Grossman’s article The Cost of Poor Communications.\n\nInclusion in an article published on Provoke Media’s The Holmes Report, allowed Grossman to present his ideas to a wider audience.\n\nThis information went on to be referenced in a variety of other articles, including sites such as Harvard Business School.\n\nThen, over time, these ideas form part of the consensus on business communication, appearing in AI search results for platforms such as Perplexity.\n\nEven With The Best Methods, Building Consensus Is A Process\n\nThis is, of course, a simplification of the process.\n\nAuthoring a study, or collaborating with another expert, is no guarantee that you will build a new consensus.\n\nYour study or collaboration may simply go unnoticed, even if you do everything right.\n\nOr, it may go against the existing consensus. In this case, you’ll face a serious uphill battle to try and change that consensus.\n\nEven if you are successful, it may take some time for a new consensus to emerge.\n\nThese things don’t happen overnight. But, that doesn’t mean you should give up; every time you publish a study or collaborate with another expert, your reach and authority grows.\n\nAnd as you continue the conversation through further studies and guest posts, a new consensus can begin to form.\n\nAt the heart of that new consensus are your ideas and expertise.\n\nIn turn, when providing sources for its search results, AI search will surface your ideas and drive traffic to your website.\n\nLong-Term Success Over Short-Term Hacks\n\nWhile new hacks are always being found, tried and tested methods will always be the better choice.\n\nInstead of chasing an ever-moving target trying to outsmart constantly evolving generative AI tools, your time is much better spent building consensus around a topic.\n\nThis means:\n\nEstablishing expertise through studies and guest posts.\n\nCollaborating with other experts to boost your reach and authority.\n\nContinuing this process of authority building over time.\n\nBuilding consensus takes time, but the payoff is lasting influence, which sees AI search surfacing your content and treating you as a trusted source of information.\n\nMore Resources:\n\nFeatured Image: Roman Samborskyi/Shutterstock"}

The RIR serves 54 nations across Africa and the Indian Ocean and has a long history of controversy and tumult involving sexual harassment, corruption, and a complex set of interlocking disputes that have seen it unable to appoint a CEO or elect board members since 2022.\n\nCourts in Mauritius have been asked to sort out the mess, which involves over 20 lawsuits, and recently appointed a receiver to conduct elections and get AFRINIC back on its feet.\n\nDo you know more? The Register is investigating recent internet governance controversies. Contact us here in confidence.\n\nOn Monday the receiver delivered a Communiqué announcing an election will be held on June 23rd.\n\nReceiver Gowtamsingh Dabee also announced the appointment of Simon Davenport, a King’s Counsel who specializes in international arbitration, to chair a Nomination Committee. Davenport will be assisted by three other UK-based Barristers.\n\nDabee wrote that the appointment was needed “to address the various concerns that I have received in relation to potential interferences in the election process” and “to ensure a completely free and fair election mechanism process.”\n\nThe Nomination Committee will design an election process, prescribe criteria for eligible candidates, interview candidates before finalizing a list, and supervise the election and the company called Civica Election Services chosen to conduct the poll.\n\nThe receiver also appointed two AFRINIC execs to an Election Committee, along with a Civica rep and an accountant from his own office.\n\nPotential interferences?\n\nThe Register has asked Mr Dabee to explain what he meant by “potential interferences in the election process.” He responded by mentioning “articles written here and there about AFRINIC and the delayed election” but did not elaborate.\n\nAnother recent incident regarding AFRINIC happened in March when South Africa’s Internet Service Providers Association warned its members “to exercise heightened vigilance regarding the security of their AFRINIC credentials” as “Entities obtaining multiple members’ credentials could manipulate voting processes, potentially altering board compositions and policy decisions in ways that may not reflect the true consensus of the AFRINIC community.”\n\nThe Association urged members who received requests to share their credentials to consult “trusted legal and technical professionals to fully understand the potential implications.” The Register asked the Association to identify any the source of any approaches to share credentials. It declined to do so.\n\nAFRINIC has previously warned its members of “solicitations” to access their credentials conducted by “obscure and fictitious organisations.\"\n\nAFRNIC’s troubles saw the other four RIRs, and their peak body the Number Resource Organisation (NRO), prepare to provide financial support for the African RIR. It also spurred the NRO to review the long-ignored policy that defines the lifecycle of an RIR, and for the first time include provisions for derecognition of the bodies.\n\nA draft of that policy was published last week and suggests derecognition proceedings can be initiated by a single RIR or 25 percent of the membership of the RIR targeted for derecognition.\n\nThe draft also requires all RIRs to “ensure the ongoing operation and stability of the Internet Number Registry System and must not operate or fail to operate in any manner that threatens such stability.” ®"}

They designed a geological schema specifically tailored to granitic pegmatite-type lithium deposits that includes 22 entity types, 16 relation types, and 184 knowledge rules.\n\nUsing a dataset consisting of 68 published research articles and four mineral exploration reports, the researchers integrated this schema into their information extraction model as a constraint mechanism.\n\nTheir findings showed that embedding the geological schema not only increased computational efficiency but also improved the accuracy of the extraction process.

But a recent leak suggests that Hue bulbs may soon have a new way to connect to Matter.\n\nAs discovered by HueBlog.com, recently filed FCC documents reveal Matter logos on the labels of a pair of unreleased Hue White A19 bulbs, suggesting that the bulbs themselves will work directly with the Matter standard.\n\nNow, all current Hue bulbs can already connect with Matter, but only thanks to the Hue Bridge, which was Matter-certified back in 2022. (A software update that enabled Matter connectivity didn’t arrive until roughly a year later.) As it stands, Hue lights connect to the bridge via Zigbee, and then the bridge makes the Matter connection over Wi-Fi.\n\nHue lights getting direct Matter connectivity might seem like a natural progression, but there’s a wrinkle. As HueBlog.com points out, the Hue White bulbs described in the FCC documents only have—per usual—Bluetooth and Zigbee radios, neither of which are part of the Matter standard. Matter does work with Wi-Fi or, ideally, Thread, the low-power, high-resiliency wireless protocol that forms a pillar of the Matter standard.\n\nSo, does that mean the new Hue blubs have Thread radios? Not according to the FCC documents, which note that the lights “only” support Bluetooth and Zigbee.\n\nBut wait, there’s more. The regulatory documents go on to say that “other functions, bands and modes [were] disabled” by the manufacturer, and the “end user has no capability to activate [them].” Could these “other functions, bands and modes” include Thread?\n\nWe’ve reached out to Philips Hue for more details.\n\nSmart products that work directly with Matter via Thread offer a number of advantages, including the ability to form self-healing mesh networks with other nearby Matter devices. While Zigbee devices also form self-healing mesh networks, non-Zigbee devices can’t join them.\n\nDirect Matter connectivity could also make Hue lights less reliant on the Hue Bridge for advanced functionality. Current Hue bulbs can be controlled without the Hue Bridge via Bluetooth, but doing so means sacrificing several key features, including out-of-home control, the ability to manage more than 10 bulbs, grouping, and custom automations.\n\nIt’s unlikely a Thread-enabled Hue bulb could match all the functionality offered by the Hue Bridge, but perhaps it could offer some middle ground.\n\nAnd if a new Thread-equipped Hue bulb is on the way, might that also mean a Thread-enabled Hue Bridge is on the horizon? We’re getting ahead of ourselves here, but still, food for thought."}

This is unusual as newer models tend to hallucinate less as the underlying AI tech improves.\n\nIn the realm of LLMs and reasoning AIs, a “hallucination” occurs when the model makes up information that sounds convincing but has no bearing in truth. In other words, when you ask questions to ChatGPT, it may respond with an answer that’s patently false or incorrect.\n\nOpenAI’s in-house benchmark PersonQA—which is used to measure the factual accuracy of its AI models when talking about people—found that o3 hallucinated in 33 percent of responses while o4-mini did even worse at 48 percent. By comparison, the older o1 and o3-mini models hallucinated 16 percent and 14.8 percent, respectively.\n\nAs of now, OpenAI says they don’t know why hallucinations have increased in the newer reasoning models. Hallucinations may be fine for creative endeavors, but they undermine the credibility of AI assistants like ChatGPT when used for tasks where accuracy is paramount. In a statement to TechCrunch, an OpenAI rep said that the company is “continually working to improve [their models’] accuracy and reliability.”"}

One X user described the chatbot as “the biggest suckup I’ve ever met,” another complained that it was “phony,” and yet another lamented the chatbot’s behavior and called it “freaking annoying.”\n\nThis is known as “sycophancy” among AI researchers, and it’s entirely intentional based on how OpenAI has trained the underlying AI models. In short, users positively rate replies that make them feel good about themselves; then, that feedback is used to train further model iterations, which feeds into a loop where AI models lean towards flattery because it gets better feedback from users on the whole.\n\nHowever, starting with GPT-4o in March, it seems the sycophancy has gone too far, so much so that it’s starting to undermine user trust in the chatbot’s responses. OpenAI hasn’t commented officially on this issue, but their own “Model Spec” documentation includes “Don’t be sycophantic” as a core guiding principle.\n\n“The assistant exists to help the user, not flatter them or agree with them all the time,” writes OpenAI in the document. “…the assistant should provide constructive feedback and behave more like a firm sounding board that users can bounce ideas off of—rather than a sponge that doles out praise.”"}

This was the plan last year, too, but I found typing out all the hashtags every time definitely discouraged me from posting about \"in-the-moment\" stuff. The goal is to quickly capture a thought, interaction, or image, share to Mastodon, and then get back to enjoying the conference.\n\nPre-populated event hashtags!\n\nSo I went looking for a solution and found that Mastodon supports share URLs with pre-filled content, like hashtags. What I wanted to do was add a URL to my phone home screen:\n\nhttps://<instance domain name>/share?text=%0A%0A%23PyCon%20%23PyConUS%20%23PyConUS2025\n\nThe above percent-encoded text parameter is:\n\n\n\n\n\n#PyCon #PyConUS #PyConUS2025\n\nIf we could save this URL direct to the home screen that would be the end of the story. Unfortunately, at least for iOS you can't save a web page that has a query parameter in the URL (like ?text=... ), so the solution needs to be slightly more complicated.\n\nWhat I ended up doing is adding this URL to a GitHub Gist and then saving the Gist webpage to my home screen. On iOS the process is:\n\nNavigate to the Gist in your mobile browser\n\nUse the \"share\" button within the browser\n\nSelect \"Add to Home Screen\" in the share screen\n\nGive the page a name (I went with \"#PyConUS2025\").\n\n:tada:"}

The Strix Point SoCs are GFX 11.5.0 IP and Krackan Point at GFX 11.5.2. Knowing GFX 11.5.1 is useful relative to older Phoronix articles when that GFX 11.5.1 bring-up began in early 2024 and now definitively being able to correlate it to Strix Halo.Today's patch also confirms the Display Core Next (DCN) IP version at 3.5.1 for Strix Halo compared to 3.5.0 with Strix Point and Krackan Point. The Video Core Next (VCN) IP block is at version 4.0.6 for Strix Halo compared to 4.0.5 with the other Ryzen AI 300 series. The SDMA IP is also slightly different at version 6.1.1 and then MP0 version at 14.0.1. Again, not particularly interesting or useful but if just trying to compare to older articles and estimate Linux kernel version support baselines and the like. These IP versions became more important under their modern block-by-block enablement strategy for new graphics/accelerator hardware in individually enabling new hardware IP blocks rather than big monolithic patch series with colorful fishy codenames for unreleased hardware.\n\nThe other purpose of this article is to let you know I should be soon reviewing the HP ZBook Ultra G1a laptop with Ryzen AI Max 300 series. Many Phoronix readers have been asking about the Linux support and performance under Strix Halo. I've been eagerly waiting to test out Strix Halo under Linux too. It looks like soon I should have my hands on the HP ZBook Ultra G1a for being able to dive into the Linux support and performance. Further down the line is hopefully the Framework Desktop with Ryzen AI Max 300 series in Q3."}

But constant iteration has rapidly advanced the tech, and now one company is selling a portable e-ink monitor that can handle a full modern OS in comfort. And shockingly, it’s not unreasonable as far as price goes.\n\nThe Dasung Paperlike 103 (via Liliputing) is a 10.3-inch portable e-ink monitor with included touch capability and a front light. (E-ink doesn’t usually allow for backlighting, and front-lighting means less eye strain.) It has a USB-C connection for power and video, and the demo clip shows it running what appears to be Windows 11 on its black-and-white display, plus working as a mirrored display for Android. And it’s running at 60 hertz! That refresh rate isn’t unusual for a budget LCD screen, but it is about 10x faster (or more) than regular e-ink devices.\n\nThe video shows Windows and Android apps scrolling at a pretty rapid pace, albeit with some noticeable screen tearing. The user is also typing comfortably with little-to-no lag, something that can be an issue with writing on e-ink readers/tablets or devices like the Freewrite. With the exception of the black-and-white screen, it really looks like you could use this with a modern, full-power device—maybe a mini PC?—without losing any functionality. Unfortunately, Dasung says that it’s decidedly not compatible with macOS.\n\nThe 4:3 display is small and a little odd with its 1872×1404 resolution, but I think it’s a realistic option if you want a comfortable way to read or write for hours without giving up access to, say, the full-power version of Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer. And Dasung is selling it for $349 USD. That’s high for a 10-inch USB-C monitor… but not unreasonable, considering that OLED portable monitors can run around the same price."}

(Automatic discount at checkout!)\n\nThe HP Pavilion Plus 14-EW1XXX is the worst name I’ve seen for a laptop in a long time, and it’s pretty dang hard to parse.

And with its IP67 rating, it’s protected against water and dust, so it’ll withstand inclement weather no problem.\n\nThe smart AI features allow the camera to shoot off notifications whenever humans are detected, for instance, while ignoring other types of motion so your phone doesn’t blow up with alerts every time there’s a light breeze. Other impressive features include two-way audio, support for both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, and custom security zones so movement is only reported when detected in those spaces.\n\nOverall, the SoloCam S220 is a dream camera that buys peace of mind whether you’re at work or on vacation, but especially at night when you hear strange noises outside.

When apps or other system processes are using that up, I see the telltale signs: slower than normal frame rates, longer load times, and in the worst cases — stuttering. But here’s how I free up my RAM just for my games and keep them running smoothly.\n\nClear the browser cache and close tabs\n\nAs I browse the web my browser will store images, fonts, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript code to save bandwidth. That’s generally a good thing, since pages will load faster. But the downside of that is it can also use up RAM. To counteract that, I clear my browser cache before I play.\n\nAdditionally, I will generally never play with browser tabs open in Windows. Why? Because tests show that having just 20 Google Chrome browser tabs open can chew up as much as 1.8GB RAM.\n\nEnd programs in Task Manager\n\nWindows Task Manager is an excellent tool for keeping a tab on your RAM usage. I am always surprised how many programs I have running idly in Windows that sap my RAM without me knowing.\n\nIn my case they are usually apps for my gaming peripherals and communications programs, all of which load into Windows by default whether I need them or not. So now I close or disable the ones that I don’t need.\n\nTo close them, you just click Ctrl + Shift + Esc to bring up the Windows Task Manager, then right-click and select End task on the programs or apps you want to close. To disable them loading into Windows on startup, select Startup apps from the left menu, then right-click on the app and choose Disable in Task Manager.\n\nClosing apps using up RAM in Windows Task Manager. Dominic Bayley / Foundry\n\nUse an optimization tool\n\nThere are a lot of apps that will act as RAM cleaners to free up memory, but personally I like to use ones made especially for gamers since they offer more gamer-specific optimizations.\n\nThe Razer Cortex app is one. The app’s Game Booster kicks in to stop unnecessary apps and processes and free up RAM as soon as I launch a game. It also optimizes the CPU, so I get a nice boost to my FPS. Razer Cortex also allows me to manually monitor my performance and make tweaks beyond the app’s automatic optimizations, so I have control over settings when I want it.\n\nWhen your PC’s device drivers and your PC’s BIOS firmware is outdated, it can result in more of your RAM being utilized than is needed. As a result, your PC can perform sluggishly or be prone to instability issues or crashes in games.\n\nKeeping these important things updated regularly will help avoid these issues. It takes just a few minutes, but you’ll be rewarded with higher FPS and less headaches trying to figure out what’s wrong when games stutter or crash.\n\nUse a gaming browser\n\nI use tip #1 when I’m playing lightweight indie games on my laptop, but for my desktop gaming PC where I do most of my high-end gaming, I use dedicated gaming browsers.\n\nBrowsers like Opera GX and Vivaldi run very lightly on the OS and utilize a lot less RAM than Google Chrome does, so you can expect better performance in your games as a result. They also come with extra features especially for gamers, which you can read more about here."}

This means Reolink’s cameras—not including its 4G models—can now process video feeds, AI alerts, and device controls entirely within users’ home networks to enhance user privacy.\n\nHome Assistant is a free and open-source smart home software platform managed by the Open Home Foundation. It has been embraced by many DIY smart home enthusiasts, and it can run on lots of different hardware, ranging from Raspberry Pi and Arm processors to the 64-bit x86 architecture commonly found in Mini PCs. It can even operate as a virtual machine on a laptop or desktop running MacOS or Windows.\n\nWe’re thrilled to welcome the first cameras to the ‘Works With Home Assistant Program’ via Reolink. Miranda Bishop, Partnership Manager at the Open Home Foundation.\n\nIn addition to being free, at least half of Home Assistant’s appeal is that it operates entirely locally, meaning there’s no reliance on the cloud. In addition to executing commands more quickly, users have more privacy because data doesn’t need to leave the home network.\n\nReolink cameras operating under Home Assistant can process their video feeds, AI alerts, and device controls entirely locally. This will save Reolink customers money by eliminating the need to pay subscriptions for cloud services or storage. Operating under Home Assistant also promises to enhance Reolink camera users’ privacy, eliminating worries about third-party access or any vulnerabilities outside a Reolink customer’s control.\n\nMany, but not all, Reolink security cameras have onboard storage; but every model can store video recordings on network-attached devices.\n\nThis news story is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best home security cameras.\n\nIncorporating Reolink cameras into a Home Assistant ecosystem comes with other benefits as well. Users will be able to link their Home Assistant-compatible smart home devices together, so that an action on one can trigger an event on others. For example, you could have your smart porch light turn on when someone rings your Reolink video doorbell."}

(Just ask anyone who played Episode 1 Racer.) But I never dreamed this thing could handle Windows on its humble hardware. Okay, it can’t actually do that… but someone has made a version of “Windows” that makes a pretty convincing attempt, and even released it as a full cartridge.\n\nGBS Windows is a sort-of game aping Windows 3.1 on Nintendo’s famous handheld. Created in a game-making program called GB Studio, this isn’t really a full-blown operating system, but it is an impressively deep bit of retro nostalgia, appropriately made and sold by an Etsy store called RubenRetro. And when I say “sold,” I mean you can buy a real, physical cartridge, complete with a retail box that integrates elements of both the original Game Boy cartridge packaging and the Windows 3.1 box. That’s according to Retro Dojo.\n\nThe wait is almost over.⏳💾\n\nNext week, the new batch of #GBSWindows will be ready.\n\nIf you missed it last time…\n\nThis is your chance. pic.twitter.com/9Ym80fzHY8 — Rubenretro (@_rubenretro_) April 16, 2025\n\nThe “operating system” looks like a teeny, tiny version of Windows 3.1 running on the GBC’s 1.7-inch screen. It includes versions of Minesweeper and “Cannon” (which looks like a Missile Command-style game), plus a tiny MIDI piano and a media player that can play back a few sample tracks while other “apps” are open. But the showstopper has to be the pint-sized Paint program, which can even print out your pixelated creations on a Game Boy Printer if you can find one. I like the “American Megatrain” text as the faux BIOS screen appears, showing the GBC’s eight kilobytes of memory a nice touch.\n\nUnfortunately, this looks like a true labor of love from a small-time creator, and the initial stock has sold out quickly. But RubenRetro seems to be making new retro boxes, manuals, and other retro-friendly accessories on the regular, so you might be able to snag some new stock if you sign up for the Etsy alerts. The full package is/was around $45 USD, but might cost a bundle in shipping from Spain depending on your location."}

There is a small car park at Tanohara, and a much larger one at ropeway.\n\nMt Ontake (御嶽山, ontake-san) is one of Japan’s Hundred Famous Mountains on the border of Nagano and Gifu prefectures. At 3067m it is the 14th tallest mountain in Japan. However unlike some of Japan’s other 3000m+ peaks (which are a little more inaccessible), Mt Ontake is doable as a day hike with a total course time of only 5 hours. I climbed Mt Ontake in October 2024, making the 4.5 hour drive from Tokyo in the early morning, and then also climbed Mt Norikura the the following day.\n\nThe peak of Mt Ontake is visible from the start of the trail, although a little obscured by the clouds today.\n\nMt Ontake is also an active volcano with a sad history - as it last erupted on the 27th of September 2014, killing 63 hikers. The day of the eruption was a sunny Saturday, with the autumn leaves at their peak. Autumn is the most popular time for hiking in Japan, so you can imagine there were a lot of hikers on the mountain. And it unfortunately erupted without warning just before lunchtime, when many were near the summit.\n\nA warning sign advising the mountain is an active volcano, and to wear a helmet.\n\nAs the mountain erupted, a large amount of ash spewed out of its crater, and flung rocks into the air. If you weren’t lucky enough to be near a shelter at the time, a direct strike from one of the falling rocks would be fatal.\n\nFor this reason, at least 50% of the people I saw today were wearing helmets, or had them strapped onto their backpacks for easy access. I also noticed there was more signage than you normally see on mountain trails in Japan, advising you of the nearest possible emergency shelter in case of an eruption.\n\nA Torii gate near the start of the trail. One of the signs showing the distance to the nearest emergency shelter. Taking in the scenery behind us.\n\nAs we climbed, we could see back down towards the information centre and carpark we started our hike at. A little bit of the yellow autumn foliage was visible too. The pictures don’t do it justice, but it was stunning.\n\nThat is one cute pig.\n\nThere were also some statues partway up the trail. I’m not really sure what they mean, but the mountain does have quite a lot of religious significance. I was particularly fond of the pig, I don’t see many of those on the mountain.\n\nA close-up of the pig and his friend. The three statues overlooking their kingdom. More of the great scenery below.\n\nAs Mt Ontake is a volcano, the entire mountain is very bare. There are only rocks or shrubs the entire hike up. The only thing that could block your views is the fog, which unfortunately there was a bit of today. The climb is also quite steep, as you have over 800m of elevation gain on a less than 7km course.\n\nThe steep climb up. I had to keep looking back at the views below! More rocks to climb\n\nAs we climbed, we passed by one of the wooden emergency mountain huts. There is a speaker attached to the side of it, to broadcast in emergency situations.\n\nThe emergency mountain hut\n\nAfter a little over 2 hours of climbing, we reached the Otaki peak (王滝頂上), which is kind of like a mini peak before the main Kengamine (剣ヶ峰) peak.\n\nThe Otaki rest area hut\n\nThere used to be an Otaki Sansou (王滝頂上山荘) mountain hut here, but it was demolished after the 2014 eruption. Instead, it has now been replaced with the Otaki “rest area” mountain hut (王滝頂上 休憩小屋). This isn’t a place to stay overnight, but is a place where you can take a break, or shelter in case of another eruption.\n\nFrom here, it is a final 20 minute hike up to the actual summit of Mt Ontake. The crater that erupted is somewhere out of sight to the left of the path.\n\nThe final push up to the summit of Mt Ontake, obscured by fog.\n\nThis stretch up to the summit is where a lot of people lost their lives. It was closed off for the last 9 years, and actually only re-opened last July. Mt Ontake does have a second, separate trailhead accessible via ropeway, so up until now that was the only way to reach the peak.\n\nThere is an increased sense of urgency on this portion of the trail, with a sign warning of no cell reception in this area, and little white signs on the ropes on the side of the path urging hikers not to stay in one place for too long.\n\nSign warning of no cell reception from this point forward - notably in English as well. The sign says to \"Move Quickly !!\"\n\nAs you climb, you also come across a weird-looking black sculpture. At first I thought maybe they were commemorating the victims of the eruption, but it turns out that they pre-date it.\n\nA weird black spirally sculpture, sort of like a diving tadpole.\n\nThis stretch of mountain is very open, with just a couple of statues scattered about. One of the interviews from a hiker who was here on the day of the eruption mentioned trying to take shelter behind one of these, since they had nowhere else to hide. The fog did add to the sense of eeriness of the scene.\n\nSince the eruption, the government has put in place additional shelters, which we saw as we continued our climb up.\n\nYou can see one of the emergency shelters ahead.\n\nA close-up of one of the emergency huts. It's like a red half-cylinder with sandbags for padding.\n\nAs we come to right before the summit, there is a stone monument in memory of the 63 hikers who lost their lives, as well as some more sturdily-built concrete shelters behind it.\n\nThe monument for the victims.\n\nClimbing the stairs towards the summit, you can get a birds-eye view of the shelters below. There are the concrete emergency shelters on the left - these looked the most sturdy. There’s also a small wooden building in the middle, which looks quite cozy, and then a larger brown building on the right, which seemed no longer to be in use.\n\nThe view from the stairs to the summit, looking back down.\n\nFrom the summit we took in the (foggy) views.\n\nThe summit of Mt Ontake, elevation 3067m. The view out below towards the Ninoike mountain hut.\n\nIf you’re short on time, you can take the same route back. We had a bit of spare time though, so we decided to take a slightly longer course near the summit before descending.\n\nWe headed towards the Ni-no-ike lake (二ノ池, ni-no-ike), which was quite small and I forgot to take a good photo of. Right next to it is the Ninoike Sansou mountain hut (二ノ池山荘).\n\nThe trail towards the Ninoike hut.\n\nPrior to the eruption there was a different hut here called the Ninoike-honkan (二ノ池本館), which sheltered 51 people during the disaster. Afterwards, it was torn down and rebuilt as the Ninoike Sansou you can see today. If you are looking to stay overnight on the mountain, this hut is probably your best bet.\n\nThe Ninoike Sansou, painted black.\n\nOnce we did our small exploratory loop, it was back down the same route to the trailhead. We passed by one of the open emergency shelters on the way back down. In the corner there was a box full of safety gear.\n\nThe emergency shelter at the hachigome (八合目) Some safety gear in the corner of the hut. Probably helmets and goggles in case of an eruption.\n\nAs we finished our hike, it had begun raining (and even hailing a tiny bit too) but we managed to get a glimpse of Mt Ontake, visible underneath the clouds.\n\nOne final goodbye to Mt Ontake\n\nThe 2014 Mt Ontake eruption\n\nIf you google the Mt Ontake eruption in Japanese, there is an endless amount of information, news articles and interviews about the topic, especially as we just passed the 10th anniversary of the disaster. However the information is not as comprehensive in English, and before the hike I had only read the English Wikipedia page, which just gave a brief overview of the eruption and the number of lives lost.\n\nIt wasn’t until after I got home and watched some of the Japanese interviews that it really sunk in for me. One father holds onto the memories of his lost 19 year old son by watching an old recording of him excitedly watching fireworks, just so he can remember what his voice sounds like. Another grieves the fact that his daughter, who died together with her boyfriend, had dreams of getting married but now will never get the opportunity to.\n\nSome of the survivors of the eruption worry that with time, the disaster will become forgotten, and people won’t be ready if the mountain does erupt again. I didn’t bring a helmet on this hike, since it hadn’t really crossed my mind to do so, but next time, I would. Not only just for safety reasons, but even just to keep the memory of the victims alive. I would recommend you do too.\n\nWith how much time I spend on the mountains, I feel so very blessed to be alive, and so sad for those that lost their lives in that eruption. May their souls rest in peace.\n\nHiking course details\n\nDate climbed Length Course time 2024-10-12 6.4km 5h (the expected time for an average hiker without breaks) If you’re looking to hike Mt Ontake as a day hike, there are two main courses: Hiking from the Otaki village side and its Tanohara trailhead (田の原登山口, tanohara-tozanguchi). This is the shortest route to the summit at 5 hours and the one we took.\n\nHiking from the town of Kiso, which requires you to take the Ontake Ropeway to the start of the trail. This is a marginally longer 5.5 hour course. If you are hiking in the autumn leaves season, the ropeway side seems to have the more stunning scenery, but distance-wise they are nearly the same. Also note that the ropeway is only in operation from the end of June to early November, although if you try and climb it outside of these periods there is probably snow anyway. As this is an active volcano and could close if there was a chance of another eruption, I would recommend double-checking that the routes are not closed before heading off on this hike. model course YAMAP activity diary 💡 How to use YAMAP\n\nPublic transportation access\n\nBoth trailheads are accessible via a bus from Kiso-Fukushima station (木曽福島駅).\n\nOtaki village side / Tanohara trailhead\n\nIf you are hiking from the Tanohara trailhead, the local bus from Kiso-Fukushima to Ontake-Tanohara (御岳田の原) leaves at 8:40 (see the bus timetable) and gets you to the trailhead in 75 minutes at 09:55. This gives you just under 6 hours to get the last return bus back at 15:45, which should be okay if you are confident in meeting the course time.\n\nThe second bus leaves at 10:40 and will get you to the trailhead at 11:55, which I think is really too late to be beginning your hike, unless you are planning on staying overnight at a mountain hut.\n\nOntake Ropeway trailhead\n\nThe first bus to the Ontake Ropeway (御岳ロープウェイ) also leaves Kiso-Fukushima at 8:40 and will get you to the ropeway at 09:32. I struggled to find a good timetable PDF, but you can also see a timetable on Navitime. I think the timetables may be different between the summer and autumn hiking seasons, so I would double-check this. Factoring in lining up for the ropeway and taking it up, you will probably be starting your hike at or after 10am. In autumn, it seems like the last bus back to Kiso-Fukushima station leaves at 16:20.\n\nGetting to Mt Ontake from Tokyo\n\nThe earliest train from Tokyo will get you to Kiso-Fukushima station at 09:16, after which you will have to wait for your connecting bus to the Tanohara trailhead or Ontake ropeway, both of which don’t leave until 10:40. If you were coming in a group, you could consider hiring a taxi to the trailhead to get there a bit quicker.\n\nOtherwise, this makes it pretty dicey as a day trip from Tokyo, so I would recommend either staying the night before, or look into taking an overnight bus from Shinjuku and arriving early in the morning at Kiso-Fukushima station.\n\nCar access details\n\nWe parked at the Tanohara trailhead, which is next to the Mt Ontake Visitor centre. It’s a 500 yen donation to use the carpark, although we arrived so late (after 10am) that the carpark was full and we ended up barely finding a spot on the side of the road instead.\n\nHowever the later you arrive, the more likely you are to be able to snag a spot from someone who has already finished their hike, so I would keep that in mind if you show up and are concerned about there not being any spots!\n\nAlternatively, the ropeway carpark can fit 700 cars, so this is probably a much better option if you are worried about finding a spot.\n\nAll the cars who couldn't make it into the carpark parked on the side of a road - a common sight at popular trailheads.\n\nTaki Ryokan\n\nSince we were planning on climbing Mt Norikura the next day, I booked a night at the Taki Ryokan (滝旅館) just a 35 minute drive from the trailhead. I’m used to staying in cheap business hotels after a hike (if not a tent like on our recent Hokkaido roadtrip) so this felt very luxurious.\n\nThe entrance to the Taki Ryokan.\n\nFor such a large ryokan, it was also surprisingly empty, with only 2 other groups of guests staying beside us. The staff mentioned that their peak season is in summer, but it seems like it’s fairly quiet otherwise. I would recommend staying here after your hike if you are looking for something different!"}

While many want that number to be lower, the truth is that email is still a valuable communication tool.\n\nWhen I opt into an email list, it’s because I anticipate something of value in return: expert insights, a story or case study, a free trial, or an event invitation. Brands have a small window of opportunity to show their value in your inbox. If they can’t, they’ll land in the no man’s land of unsubscribe. If they can, they gain a seat at the table.\n\nSo, how can brands follow the latter path? I dove deep into my own inbox, spoke to email marketing experts, and explored top brands to bring you best practices for B2B email marketing success— with 10 examples of brands leading the way.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is B2B email marketing?\n\nB2B (business-to-business) email marketing is the practice of using email campaigns to promote products, services, or messaging to other businesses instead of individual consumers. B2B email marketing is typically partially or fully automated through an email marketing platform like HubSpot, with varying levels of sophistication and personalization.\n\nB2B marketers use email marketing for several purposes: to reach and nurture leads, onboard new clients, build brand loyalty, share product tips and updates, and cross-sell and upsell. All in all, B2B email marketing is a valuable channel because it allows brands to initiate a conversation where professionals spend the most time— their inbox.\n\nA Beginner's Guide to Email Marketing How to execute and measure successful email marketing campaigns Growing an email list.\n\nGrowing an email list.

Download Now\n\nWhat makes a great B2B marketing email?\n\nNo matter which type of B2B email you’re creating— newsletters, welcome emails, drip campaigns, or sales prospecting emails— any marketing email worth its salt should have these three components.\n\n1. Personalization\n\n94% of marketers say personalization increases sales, and 96% say it leads to repeat business. But personalizing emails takes more than adding their first name to the salutation.\n\nUse segmenting and signal-based intent to send dynamic, personalized emails that can move a lead through the funnel. For example, reference a recent event a prospect attended or content they downloaded to continue the conversation. You can also personalize emails with dynamic content, for example, swapping out a case study relevant to that client’s industry.\n\n2. Sharp Copy\n\nGood B2B emails should be brief, relevant, and packed with value. The primary way that you showcase your value is with your words, aka copy.\n\n“Well-crafted copy that resonates with the audience's needs and interests is vital. It should be concise, clear, and focused on providing value rather than just promoting products,” says B2B email marketing specialist and copywriter Joe Cunningham.\n\nFirst, craft an intriguing subject line and pre-header to pique a reader’s attention. Then, don’t waste your reader’s time with fluff— you need to earn every open and click with great writing.\n\n“Show busy potential clients or busy contacts that this is, in fact, worth reading, why it‘s worth someone’s time, and how it's going to fix a problem for them,” advises Cunningham. Telling stories and sharing the voice of the customer can also connect you to the audience.\n\n3. A Strong Call-to-Action\n\nNo marketing email is complete without a clear call-to-action (CTA). Even a newsletter or thank you email should have a call-to-action! Many businesses make the mistake of leaving one out or putting too many in, confusing readers about what to do next.\n\nButton text like “Read the blog” isn’t strong enough to convince someone to click. Write CTA copy that speaks to the value you offer, like “Learn how to save three hours a week” or “Book your free consult today”.\n\nB2B Email Marketing Tips from the Experts\n\nI’ve managed email marketing at a startup, a financial services company, and a university. I also interviewed two email marketing specialists about their secrets to email marketing success, and here are the best practices we all agreed on.\n\n1. Keep it short.\n\nMore is not better when you have a specific goal for your content. \"People are not going to read through a bunch of content,” says Destiny Loyd, Sr. Lifecycle & Email Marketing Manager for Apptio. “So as an email marketing manager, getting to the point is very important. You need to be able to get to the point within the first one to two paragraphs and give the call of action very early on to keep reader engagement.”\n\nKeep the number of clicks as low as possible when asking someone to complete an action, and question whether you need readers to click away at all or whether you can share the key information in the email.\n\n2. Segment your emails.\n\nI’ve already stated how important it is to personalize your emails, and I’ll say it again. Segmentation, where you separate your email lists by audience, industry, or lead stage, lets you send only highly relevant, personalized content to each group.\n\nSo instead of having one big mailing list where you send company updates, segment your emails by audience: prospects, leads, current customers, suppliers, partners, and so on.\n\n“List management is the boring part. It isn’t sexy, it’s not fun, and it can be time-consuming,” says Cunningham. “Segmentation requires a lot of strategic thinking with the data you're collecting and the data in your CRM, but it’s a huge opportunity to send more relevant and effective emails.”\n\n3. Stop blasting your contacts.\n\nThere’s no right number to how often you should email B2B leads or partners— it depends on lots of factors. But we all know that many companies take email too far. When you send too many emails, you risk driving your audience away.\n\n\"Over-communicating can lead to disengagement,” warns Loyd.\n\nAudit your emails by looking at analytics regularly. If your engagement or unsubscribes are below email marketing benchmarks, consider cutting down or consolidating the emails you send. You can also use standard suppression rules to streamline emails: for example, add a suppression list for registered attendees so you don’t keep asking people who have already registered to attend your event.\n\n4. Centralize your email management.\n\nI once worked at a university that audited how many emails students received from all the different university departments, and the results were eye-opening, to say the least. One key way to right-size your email sends is to coordinate your email marketing strategy across departments. Marketing, sales, customer success, and corporate communications may all send separate email journeys, inundating readers.\n\n“I have been at places where anybody can request an email, and it makes it hard for others — or even me as the email marketing manager — to keep up with what's being sent out,” shares Loyd.\n\n“Establish a point of contact and a regular meeting to talk about what's coming out of each department via email this month. Centralizing email requests is important because it will help you strategize, be more targeted, and help the company avoid over-emailing their database.”\n\n5. It’s not about you.\n\n\"I think one of the biggest mistakes companies make is making emails too much about them — their news, their products — rather than focusing on what their audience actually needs or wants,” advises Cunningham. Instead of talking all about yourself, focus on the problems you are solving and the value you provide.\n\nOne simple way to do this is by using the second-person “you” to address readers and their pain points directly rather than using disconnected corporate speak. Consider how these subject lines hit differently:\n\n[Company] launches [product name] with innovative payroll solutions\n\nSick of payroll errors? Alleviate payroll headaches with automated workflows.\n\n6. Keep your brand and tone consistent across emails.\n\nYour emails’ voice, tone, and branding should match across campaigns and any landing pages or content assets where you send them.\n\n“If you send an email that‘s very straight to the point and simple to read and understand, then you drive them to a website that is not simple and easy, you’ll to lose them immediately because there’s a disconnect,” says Loyd. “Brand consistency plays a huge role in driving people down the journey and giving them a sense of familiarity and continuity.”\n\nAs a best practice, create a brand and voice guide for anyone creating emails to follow. Then, write on-brand email templates that your sales team or anyone else sending emails can adapt and share for individual emails.\n\n7. Test different hooks, angles, and visuals.\n\nWords and design matter in email marketing. As you write subject lines and body copy, make a practice of A/B testing different copy and visuals to gather evidence on what works best.\n\nWhile marketers have some audience data and personas, creating great marketing content still requires a certain level of guesswork. You might be surprised by what resonates best, so stay curious and test often.\n\nA Beginner's Guide to Email Marketing How to execute and measure successful email marketing campaigns Growing an email list.\n\nGrowing an email list.

Use automation for smarter outreach.\n\nEmail marketing is, by nature, mass communication. To make it personalized, relevant, and timely at scale, look to automation. Setting automated campaigns means that once you set it up, you can send email marketing campaigns in your sleep. Here are three ways to approach automated email marketing.\n\nJourneys\n\nJourneys are an automated sequence of emails sent on a pre-set schedule. These are good for onboarding or nurturing campaigns to help them reach a long-term goal like retention or a purchase. The downside of traditional journeys is that once they start, you can’t adjust or personalize the content.\n\n“Ensure that you're documenting the logic behind the journeys and all the criteria, triggers, exit criteria, and all of those things that go into that journey,” recommends Loyd.\n\nBehavior-Based Drip Campaigns\n\nDrip campaigns are individual emails or sequences triggered based on behaviors, also known as signals. Examples of signals could include downloading content, attending an event, completing a sales call, or logging into a platform.\n\nBasing your emails on behavior ensures that you’re reaching prospects with the right message at the exact right time.\n\nFor example, if it’s a week into a prospect’s free trial period and they still haven’t logged into their account, it’s pointless to ask them to sign up since they haven’t tried the software yet. Instead, you can focus on educational content reminding them about the trial. After a signal like them logging into the account three times, you can switch to conversion campaigns.\n\nAI-Powered Email Marketing Campaigns\n\nFinally, you can power up drip and nurture campaigns with the power of AI. Instead of relying on broad segmentation, where leads are grouped based on shared characteristics, AI can analyze multiple data points to understand each individual's behavior and intent— and recommend content and campaigns based on the data.\n\nFor example, HubSpot’s team revamped their email marketing using first-party marketing data, enriched company data, and thousands of intent signals. They aimed to have AI determine each prospect’s goal and create the perfect messaging and piece of content to send to help them reach that goal. As a result of this hyper-personalization at scale, they saw a 30% boost in open rates, a 50% boost in click-throughs, and an 82% lift in conversions.\n\n10 B2B Email Marketing Examples to Learn From\n\nGreat emails can be hard to find, so I’ve done the hard work for you. Each example from a B2B brand below showcases stellar copywriting, design, and relevance to their audience. I’ve given a teardown for why each email hits the mark and how you can emulate it.\n\n1. Newsletter: The Hustle by HubSpot\n\nI love a good newsletter that can bring me up-to-date on the week’s news and stories without disappearing into a doomscrolling cycle. One of my go-to emails for this is The Hustle.\n\nWith over two million subscribers, The Hustle brings together the week’s most interesting headlines, original business features, and video and podcast content into daily and weekly emails. I love discovering timely articles I didn’t know I needed, like an article on the business of Halloween theme parks.\n\nWhat I like: While sprinkled with free resources from owner HubSpot, the purpose of The Hustle isn’t to sell. It’s to build an audience and share expertise from across marketing, sales, small business, and tech. The spot-on mix of original multimedia content and current events commentary keeps me coming back, week after week.\n\n2. Newsletter: Coda\n\nThe Docket is the monthly newsletter for Coda, an all-in-one collaborative document editor and collaborative workspace. The newsletter combines product tips, updates, and useful content for knowledge workers. Coda’s in the process of being acquired by Grammarly (another brand with a killer email game!), so I’m looking forward to seeing how the brand and email content evolves.\n\nWhat I like: Coda’s colorful design stands out among a sea of white-background content. The copy is always playful, with a few good workplace puns to keep learning light. I like the “Small things considered” section with visual, bite-sized product highlights (and an NPR-inspired title!).\n\n3. Lenny’s Newsletter\n\nWhen I asked my community what their favorite B2B emails are, a few people said they’re far more interested in following solo creators than brands right now. I tend to agree: people-led email content is booming right now. In tech circles, there’s one solo creator whose name comes up again and again: Lenny’s Newsletter.\n\nWho is Lenny, you ask? Well, he’s just a guy— a guy who’s built an entire business around an email newsletter. Lenny Rachitsky, a seasoned product manager, launched a newsletter in 2020 sharing product thought leadership and interviews and it’s become the go-to product publication. His readership just topped one million email subscribers, including 18,000 paid accounts, a paid Slack community, podcast, and consulting.\n\nWhat I like: Lenny’s Newsletter shares those rare senior-level insights from those in the trenches of building innovative products. He also shares his unique perspective and voice from inside the industry. The newsletter feels like a community, with frequent guest contributions and reader spotlights. It’s great inspiration for brands for how to put people at the center of your email marketing efforts.\n\n4. Drip Campaign: Adobe\n\nAdobe is one of my favorite brands, and that carries over to their email marketing. I never feel inundated by Adobe emails— there’s no fluff— and their content is always brief, visually crisp, and clear.\n\nWhat I like: It’s no surprise that Adobe emails have excellent design, but I’m always delighted at the sharp copywriting with headlines like, “Docs on loc,” “Turn to-dos into ta-das,” and “Make taxes less taxing”. I also love the simplicity of having just one CTA. There’s no question or confusion about what the next step is.\n\nA Beginner's Guide to Email Marketing How to execute and measure successful email marketing campaigns Growing an email list.\n\nGrowing an email list.

Drip Email: Figma\n\nAs a design company, it’s no surprise that Figma creates delightful emails. As a Figma user, I like that the company keeps its emails few and far between but packed with value.\n\nWhat I like: Figma keeps its value proposition clear throughout the email content. It never simply tells you about a cool new feature; it tells you how it makes your life better or easier. The visual branding, clear designs, and fun illustrations are consistent throughout different emails and stay true to the playful, helpful voice of the brand.\n\n6. Nurture Campaign: Circle\n\nCircle is an online community platform that helps creators and brands engage their communities. When you join their email list, you’ll receive professional and relevant emails with original industry reports, event invitations, and inside tips like “How our top 10% of creators really build thriving communities”.\n\nWhat I like: Circle’s emails bring consistent branding visuals and relevant content for community builders. I like that many of their emails come from a specific person on their team (like “Alexis at Circle”) so it isn’t just a faceless brand email. I also love how they use the voice of the customer. The nurture email above, for example, has just a short blurb and CTA, while three-quarters of the content features the voice of the customer through testimonial quotes.\n\n7. Nurture Email: Beyond Meat\n\nWhy should SaaS companies have all the fun? Alternative protein producer Beyond Beef shows how brands in industries like food and agriculture can show up in a big way in emails.\n\nWhat I like: Beyond Beef brings its bold, passionate, and sometimes irreverent brand voice to its email marketing. It uses appealing visuals and CTAs to stand out to its busy audience of restaurants and caterers.\n\n8. Onboarding Emails: Perplexity\n\nPerplexity calls itself the “world’s first answer engine,” and AI-powered, streamlined search alternative. Since Perplexity is a new category of tech, its onboarding sequence is crucially important to educate users on what they can do with the app before the free trial winds down. Nailing your onboarding emails helps you engage users and avoid churn.\n\nWhat I like: Perplexity’s onboarding sequence contains seven emails (it’s in the subject line: 4/7, etc.) which walk the user through the best use cases of the app. They contain bright hero images and concrete product examples with images and prompts.\n\n9. Offer Email: Squarespace\n\nOne of the common mistakes brands make is to cram too much into a sales email. Take at look at this offer email from Squarespace: by keeping it short and focusing on just one offer, incentive, and CTA, they raise the chance that the reader will convert.\n\nThis likely isn’t the first email Squarespace would send to a prospect. The reader has likely already received a drop campaign or completed a free trial and needs and incentive to buy.\n\nWhat I like: Squarespace uses the power of urgency and scarcity to tempt a reader to buy a subscription. The email gives a percentage discount and an expiration date for the offer. Even the CTA copy (“Save now”) speaks to the tangible value of the offer.\n\n10. Product Email: Notion\n\nThe organization tool Notion can do a thousand different things, and that level of overwhelm could turn users off. To combat that, Notion’s email marketing and product updates help users understand the best use cases for them.\n\nWhat I like: Notion uses product GIFs to show its product in action and give examples of how someone could use the product. Its email designs are always simple and clear, in line with the brand.\n\nLessons in Email Marketing: How to Improve Your Email Game\n\nWhen done right, B2B email marketing is still a powerful engine for engaging leads, nurturing relationships, and driving business growth. The best B2B marketing emails aren’t just delivering information; they’re creating value and helping clients solve problems.\n\nWhether you’re just getting started or optimizing an existing strategy, I hope these B2B email marketing examples inspired you to craft better emails. Subscribe to a few of these brands’ email lists, and keep a swipe file of inspiring content to improve your own.\n\nLook for an email marketing service and AI-powered tools to help you reach your goals. With personalization, sharp copywriting, and a clear call to action, you’ll engage your prospects and earn a seat at the table."}

I thought they gave that up two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"It's all just the same old stuff from the media. That's an old one. Try finding something new.\"\n\nAsked if he still had confidence in Hegseth's ability to lead the Pentagon, Trump said, \"Oh, totally.\"\n\n\"Great confidence,\" he said, adding that \"the spirit in the armed forces is fantastic.\"\n\nLast month, The Atlantic reported that its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, had mistakenly been added to a Signal group chat in which top Trump administration officials, including Hegseth, discussed sensitive military details about a pending attack on the Houthi rebels that was carried out on March 15.\n\nAmid the fallout, an investigation was launched into leaks, resulting in at least three top aides being fired.\n\nOn Sunday, it was reported that there was a second 13-person Signal group chat in which the war plans were discussed. This group was created by Hegseth and included his wife and former Fox news producer, Jennifer Hegseth, who is not a Defense Department employee; and the secretary's brother, Phil, as well as his personal lawyer Time Parlatore, both of whom work at the Pentagon.\n\nThe reports state Hegseth used his personal phone to message in that group chat.\n\nThe New York Times was the first to report on the existence of the second Signal chat.\n\nThe initial revelation that the Defense officials were using the encrypted smartphone application to communicate about sensitive military information was met with swift calls from Democrats for Hegseth to resign -- calls that have resumed and seemingly amplified following the Sunday night reporting.\n\n\"Being the Secretary of Defense is serious business and it's clear he's not up to it,\" military veteran and astronaut Sen. Mark Kelly, D- Ariz., said on X. \"Hegseth needs to resign or be fired.\"\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, said the reports show \"how completely incompetent\" Hegseth has been as the head of the Pentagon.\n\n\"This guy's got to go,\" he said. \"The question is will all my Republican colleagues who love to say they support national security, will any of them raise their voice and say this is a bridge to far.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Don Bacon, of Nebraska, also suggested Hegseth should be let go.\n\n\"If it's true that he had another [Signal] chat with his family about the missions against the Houthis, it's totally unacceptable,\" he told Politico in an interview. \"I'm not in the White House, and I'm not going to tell the White House how to manage this ... but I find it unacceptable, and I wouldn't tolerate it if I was in charge.\"\n\nHe added that Hegseth was acting as if \"he's above the law -- and that shows an amateur person.\"\n\nPrior to The Time's reporting being published, John Ullyot, a Pentagon official who resigned last week, penned an opinion piece for Politico in which he described the Defense Department as being dysfunctional under Hegseth's leadership and that it has become \"a major distraction\" for Trump.\n\nHe added that it appeared that Hegseth was close to being removed as secretary.\n\nA veteran and former Fox News host, Hegseth was an unorthodox and controversial pick for secretary of defense. He had attracted criticism during his confirmation hearings from Democrats over his lack of military leadership experience, financial mismanagement of a veterans nonprofit organization and allegations of alcohol abuse and sexual misconduct.\n\nRelated Links\n\nLearn about the Superpowers of the 21st Century at SpaceWar.com\n\nLearn about nuclear weapons doctrine and defense at SpaceWar.com\n\n"}

The papers have been cited 42, 71, and 27 times respectively, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.\n\nAll three notices reference a third party who alerted the journal to image duplication issues. The retraction notices for the 2002 and 2009 papers also reference image reuse by different articles with some of the same authors. “Each article in which these images appear describes different experimental conditions,” the 2002 notice reads.\n\nGao did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Wiley, which publishes The Prostate, told Retraction Watch the journal was investigating “additional concerns flagged via PubPeer associated with” Gao.\n\nSleuth Elisabeth Bik pointed out image irregularities on PubPeer for two of the retracted papers, although the Wiley spokesperson did not respond to our question about whether the third party listed in the notices referenced these comments. Gao has more than 20 papers with comments on PubPeer, most of which reference image manipulation and duplication concerns, with several described on the blog For Better Science.\n\nThe three retracted papers share coauthor Soo Ok Lee, a former researcher with the University of Rochester. Lee and Gao were affiliated with the same universities at the time of each publication.

Lee did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nTwo papers by Lee and Gao have been amended in Oncogene, a Springer Nature title. One article, published in 2003, received an expression of concern for image duplication and shared images with one of the newly retracted papers, according to the notice. The other, a 2023 paper, received a correction on April 10 for “inadvertent” image duplication.\n\nA representative for UC Davis told us the university was “conducting a review of this matter” but was “unable to comment on specific allegations at this time.”\n\nCorrection, April 28, 2025: Gao was the last and corresponding author on the three papers, not the first author, as originally stated.\n\nLike Retraction Watch?

It celebrates our amazing universe every day.\n\nSince its inception in 1995, NASA APOD has been selecting and publishing some of the best images of space. Its two editors, Robert Nemiroff and Jerry Bonnell, are the people behind it. Here, you can see images taken with space telescopes like Hubble, JWST, etc. But it also includes amateur images taken with regular DSLR cameras.\n\nHere are some of the best images from March 2025.\n\nA Quadruple Alignment over Italy\n\nWhy is this Moon so strange-looking? Its striking red hue is a major factor. The colour results from the Earth’s atmosphere deflecting blue light, which is also the reason why the sky appears blue during the day. Additionally, the Moon seems oddly warped. Its peculiar structure is an optical phenomenon caused by layers in the Earth’s atmosphere that, as a result of abrupt variations in pressure or temperature, refract light in distinct ways. A third reason for the Moon’s strange appearance is that, coincidentally, an aeroplane is flying in front of it. Towards the end of February, a beautiful gibbous moon was photographed over Turin, Italy. Two historic ground structures, the Basilica of Superga just beyond and the Sacra di San Michele on the nearby hill, were part of an uncommon quadruple alignment that includes our famous hovering sky orb.\n\nStarburst Galaxy Messier 94\n\nMessier 94 is located in Canes Venatici, the northern constellation of hunting dogs, at a distance of only 15 million light years. The face-on spiral galaxy, about 30,000 light-years across, is a popular target for terrestrial astronomers, with spiral arms running around the edges of its large disc. However, the Hubble Space Telescope’s field of view covers around 7,000 light-years over M94’s centre region. The sharp close-up focuses on the galaxy’s tight, brilliant centre and noticeable inner dust lanes, which are ringed by an impressive bluish ring of new, massive stars. The big stars in the ring appear to be less than 10 million years old, indicating that the galaxy had a well-defined period of fast star production.\n\nGalaxies in Space\n\nIn this space age exposure recorded by astronaut Don Pettit, the plane of our Milky Way galaxy extends beyond Earth’s limb. His camera, set to low light and long endurance, was pointed out the window of a Dragon crew spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on January 29. The orbiting outpost was approximately 400 km above the Pacific Ocean at the time. The Earth below is blurred by motion, but the stunning vista from low Earth orbit shows the Milky Way’s conspicuous satellite galaxies, known as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, in the upper left corner of the frame. Fans of the southern sky can also see the Southern Cross.\n\nCyclones at Jupiter’s North Pole\n\nWhy are there so many cyclones at Jupiter’s north pole? The topic is still being investigated. In 2018, NASA’s robotic Juno spacecraft circling Jupiter collected data that was utilised to create this breathtaking image of Jupiter’s mysterious cyclones at its north pole. Infrared observations measure the thermal emission from Jovian cloud tops and are not limited to the hemisphere lit by sunlight. They reveal eight cyclonic structures that surround a 4,000-kilometer-wide cyclone located just off the huge planet’s geographic north pole. Similarly, data suggest a cyclone at the Jovian south pole and five circumpolar cyclones. The south polar cyclones are slightly bigger than their northern counterparts.\n\nNGC 1672: Barred Spiral Galaxy from Hubble\n\nMany spiral galaxies contain bars in their centres. Even our own Milky Way Galaxy is believed to have a small core bar. The prominently barred spiral galaxy NGC 1672, seen here, was captured in amazing clarity in an image acquired by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. There are dark filamentary dust lanes, youthful clusters of bright blue stars, red emission nebulas of blazing hydrogen gas, a long bright bar of stars across the centre, and a bright active nucleus that most likely contains a supermassive black hole. Light takes about 60 million years to reach us from NGC 1672, which is approximately 75,000 light years wide.\n\nThe Protostars within Lynds 483\n\nThis near-infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope shows two protostars buried in a single pixel in the centre of an eye-catching hourglass-shaped nebula. The star system is actively forming in Lynds 483, a dusty molecular cloud located about 650 light-years away in the constellation Serpens Cauda. Over thousands of years, collapsing protostars have been blasting out collimated, intense jets of material, causing the magnificent bipolar outflows. Webb’s high-resolution image depicts the violence of star formation in vivid detail, as twisting shock fronts expand and smash with slower, denser material. The first close-up of the star-forming region in the dark nebula Lynds 483 covers less than half a light-year.\n\nTololo Totality\n\nThe moon was full on March 14. That placed the Moon 3.14 radians (180 degrees) from the Sun in the Earth’s sky, making it a fitting celebration of Pi Day. As an added benefit for those who enjoy both Pi and the night sky, the Moon also underwent a total lunar eclipse on that date, passing straight through Earth’s umbral shadow. The colours of an eclipsed Moon can be striking under clear skies. This time series composite image from Cerro Tololo Observatory, Chile, captured the darker lunar disc reflecting the intensely reddish sunlight scattered into Earth’s shadow. The beginning, middle, and end of the approximately one-hour total eclipse phase are depicted in the lunar triptych.\n\nBlue Ghost’s Diamond Ring\n\nEarth’s inhabitants witnessed a total lunar eclipse on March 14 as the Full Moon passed into the planet’s dark umbral shadow. Naturally, that same astronomical syzygy was perceived as a solar eclipse from the Moon’s near side. Around 3:30 am CDT, as the Sun was just coming out from behind the terrestrial disc, the Blue Ghost lander, which was operating in the Mare Crisium on the lunar surface, took this video frame of Earth in silhouette. The stunning diamond ring effect, which is well-known to those who watch solar eclipses on Earth, is remarkable when viewed from Blue Ghost’s lunar perspective. The inner solar corona, the Sun’s atmosphere that is most visible from Earth during a complete solar eclipse, is obscured by the lunar surface, which makes Earth appear roughly four times as large as the Sun. Nevertheless, the bright band of sunlight that envelops our lovely planet is the result of scattering in Earth’s thick atmosphere.\n\nMessier 81\n\nMessier 81 is a large, stunning galaxy that is comparable in size to our Milky Way Galaxy and is one of the brightest galaxies in the sky. This massive spiral is located towards the northern constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear, and is sometimes referred to as NGC 3031 or Bode’s galaxy after its discoverer in the 18th century. M81’s bright yellow centre, blue spiral arms, pinkish star-forming areas, and sweeping cosmic dust lanes are all visible in the crisp, precise telescopic image. However, in contrast to other notable spiral characteristics, some dust lanes cut across the galactic disc (left of centre). A close approach between M81 and the nearby galaxy M82, which is hiding outside of this frame, could be the cause of the misplaced dust lanes.\n\nA Partial Solar Eclipse over Iceland\n\nWhat if the Moon and Sun rose at the same time? Shortly after daybreak on 29th March, a partial solar eclipse took place over certain northern regions of the planet Earth. Northeastern areas of North America and northwest parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa were among the regions where the Moon blocked a portion of the Sun. The highlighted image was taken yesterday over Iceland’s Grábrók volcanic crater, when the Moon briefly obscured a large portion of the Sun. Despite the overcast sky, the photographer’s pal meticulously prepared the shot so that it seemed as though the Sun was being pulled out from behind the Moon. This time, there was no total solar eclipse anywhere on Earth.\n\nIf you have a space image, you can submit it to NASA APOD, too.\n\nFor more incredible astrophotography photos, check our previous Breathtaking Astronomy Photos articles:\n\nClear skies!"}

Here’s how it works\n\nThe Washington Post and OpenAI have announced a new partnership aimed at making The Post's news stories more available within ChatGPT.\n\nUnder this deal, when people ask ChatGPT questions where The Post has relevant reporting, the AI will show summaries, quotes, and links back to the original articles on The Post's website.\n\nBoth outfits say this collaboration is all about helping people find reliable information more easily, especially for complex or fast-moving subjects where solid reporting really matters.\n\nThe idea is that ChatGPT will highlight The Post's journalism across big topics like politics, global events, business, and tech, always making it clear where the information comes from and providing direct links so folks can read the full stories.\n\nPeter Elkins-Williams, Head of Global Partnerships at The Washington Post, weighed in, saying:\n\nWe’re all in on meeting our audiences where they are. Ensuring ChatGPT users have our impactful reporting at their fingertips builds on our commitment to provide access where, how and when our audiences want it.\n\nThe partnership follows a string of content licensing deals OpenAI has signed with major media outlets around the world, including News Corp, Axel Springer, the Financial Times, Dotdash Meredith, Vox Media, and The Atlantic. These agreements usually give OpenAI the right to use news content to train its models and shape ChatGPT’s responses, including generating summaries and linking to original sources.\n\nBut while these partnerships are expanding, legal troubles are also building. One of the most notable cases is a lawsuit from The New York Times, which claims OpenAI used its copyrighted content without permission or fair compensation.\n\nThat lawsuit has added to broader concerns from across the media industry, where some groups have started calling this kind of AI training \"AI theft\" and are urging governments to step in with regulations and require payments to publishers whose content gets used."}

Journal editors should join together and publicly renounce this as yet more thinly guised anti-science political blackmail.”\n\n\n\nJT Morris, a senior supervising attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, told MedPage Today that the First Amendment clearly protects CHEST’s independence.\n\n“A publication’s editorial decisions are none of the government’s business, whether it’s a newspaper or a medical journal,” he said. “Like with any bully, the best response is to stand up to them—and that includes officials who try to intimidate Americans into parroting the government’s view. The First Amendment packs a powerful punch, and it has these medical journals’ backs.”"}

A divide has opened up across the industry, with some publishers and news organizations opting to forge alliances with AI companies in order to secure revenue and a measure of security, but others taking legal action at what they perceive as an existential threat. The New York Times Co. sued OpenAI earlier this year, and last month a judge ruled the copyright infringement claim can proceed.\n\nThe Post, which has been owned by Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos for more than a decade, has hit a rocky period of late. It lost a large chunk of its subscriber base after Bezos announced shortly before last November’s election that the Post would not make an endorsement in the presidential race. In addition to that break from longtime precedent, Bezos also re-oriented the outlet’s op-ed operation. He issued a directive that the opinion section would advocate for “personal liberties and free markets” and not run any pieces deemed to oppose those principles.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nFar beyond the news business, Amazon is among a handful of tech behemoths pledging to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI over the coming years. Microsoft, one of those top-tier players, has also invested $13 billion in OpenAI, helping ChatGPT gain scale in recent years.\n\nThe partnership “reflects a shared commitment to making reliable, factual information easier to find and engage with,” a press release said. That is especially true, it added, with “complex or fast-moving topics, where timely, well-sourced reporting, like that of The Post, matters most.” Plans call for “clear attribution and direct links to full articles,” enabling readers to gain additional background and context.\n\nThe notion of links, long the lifeblood of the internet, being marginalized by the march toward an AI-dominated future has raised alarms at many news organizations given major changes by Google to its search algorithm. As one of the contestants in the AI arms race, Google is leveraging its nearly 90% market share in search to promote search results from its AI platform Gemini. The objective is to retain traffic within Google rather than linking out to posts from external sites.\n\n“We’re all in on meeting our audiences where they are,” said Peter Elkins-Williams, Head of Global Partnerships at The Washington Post. “Ensuring ChatGPT users have our impactful reporting at their fingertips builds on our commitment to provide access where, how and when our audiences want it.”\n\nVarun Shetty, Head of Media Partnerships at OpenAI, said more than 500 million users each week use ChatGPT, giving it important reach for news outlets. “By investing in high-quality journalism by partners like The Washington Post, we’re helping ensure our users get timely, trustworthy information when they need it,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe Post deal follows 20 similar deals between OpenAI and news publishers, spanning 160 outlets and more than 20 languages."}

Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nI came this close to laughing off the PR pitch for 73&Sunny’s GripStand remote control cases. Who needs a case for their streaming device’s remote control? It turns out that everyone needs one–and not just to shield the remote from damage when it inevitably falls onto the floor.\n\nMade from a rubbery silicone, the sleeve wraps your remote in a tight embrace, with cutouts for its buttons and ports: USB-C, Lightning, headphone jack, microphone, volume controls, and so on, depending on the model. The manufacturer makes them for the Amazon Fire TV Alexa Voice Remote Pro (2022 model), the Apple TV Siri remote (second and third generations), the Roku Express remote, and the Roku Voice Remote. I received four samples in a variety of colors, but this review is primarily based on my experience with the Apple TV Siri remote.\n\nGripStand cases are available in various colors for the Amazon Fire TV Alexa Voice Remote Pro (2022 model), Apple TV Siri remote (2nd and 3rd generations) (left), Roku Voice Remote, and the Roku Express remote. Michael Brown/Foundry\n\nThe silicone material makes the remotes supremely easy to grip, but a lanyard and a strip of vertical ridges in the middle of the backside of the sleeve makes this even easier. The extra-thick back and sides of the sleeves cushion the remote and should protect it from a drop from just about any height onto just about any surface. Finally, the bottom of the sleeve flares out, allowing the remote to stand up vertically. But the design also provides a second function: It can harbor a Tile Tracker or an Apple AirTag.\n\nThe bulged bottom and the grippy sleeve already make it difficult for the remote control to get lost in the couch cushions; but should that happen anyway—or if the remote wanders off through some other means—putting a Bluetooth tracker inside it will make it a snap to find. This last feature is less valuable for the Alexa and Roku Voice remotes, which already have their own remote finder features, but the Apple and Tile trackers might offer better range.\n\nThe bulged bottom of the GripStand Remote Case lets you stand the remote up on its bottom, but you can also put a Bluetooth tracker in that cavity. Michael Brown/Foundry\n\nGripStands are available in both wild and tame colors, depending on the model. The Siri Remote version I reviewed has the most options: Lime Glow, Sky Glow, Ultra Black, Army Green, Slate Ocean, and Fiery Red. The Glow colors, as you’ve probably guessed, glow in the dark. The two versions of the Roku remote GripStand are available in the same colors as the Siri Remote model, except for Fiery Red. The Alexa Voice Remote Pro version of the GripStand has the fewest color options, just Coral (pink), Green, or Yellow.\n\nShould you buy a GripStand Remote Case?\n\nPrices, which are generally about half the cost of buying a new remote, are the one reservation I have about recommending the GripStand. And, for whatever reason, the Siri Remote version costs more than the rest of the collection: $24.99 compared to $19.99 for the Amazon and Roku versions. At the time of this writing, however, the Apple remote was on sale for $19.99, the Roku Express model was slashed to $9.99, and the Roku Voice Remote was discounted to $14.99.\n\nThose sale prices make the GripStand a better value, but it’s a great product even at full price. It will make your streaming remote easier to hold and use, and it should eliminate the annoyance of sitting down to watch some TV entertainment only to realize you can’t find the remote."}

Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nTeamgroup’s MP44Q — a new host memory buffer (HMB/DRAM-less) SSD popped to the top of the performance charts for that category. It’s fast and affordable for everyday chores.\n\nHowever, it’s not for extended heavy-duty use as its QLC NAND slows drastically once secondary cache is exhausted.\n\nWhat are the Teamgroup MP44Q’s features?\n\nThe MP44Q is a host memory buffer, NVMe/PCIe 4.0 SSD that ships in the 2280 (22mm wide, 80 mm long) form factor. The NAND is multi-layer QLC (Quad-Level Cell/4-bit), and the controller is a Maxio MAP-1602A.\n\nThe warranty on the MP44Q is five years and the TeraBytes that may be Written rating is 512TBW. That far exceeds the 250TBW we normally see for QLC NAND SSDs, and is only a hair shy of the 600TBW that’s the average for TLC (Triple-Level Cell/3-bit) SSDs. Nice.\n\nHow much does the Teamgroup MP44Q cost?\n\nThe MP44Q is available in $52/1TB, $102/2TB (tested), and $207/4TB capacities. Those were outstandingly low prices at the time of this writing.\n\nHow fast is the Teamgroup MP44Q?\n\nGlad you asked. While the 2TB MP44Q’s synthetic benchmark numbers didn’t reach number one, when combined with solid real world performance they pushed the drive to the top PCIe 4.0/HMB spot overall — in our testing.\n\nBut as already stated, there’s a caveat. If you go just a little beyond the 450GB we write, the QLC’s native write rate kicks in and drops transfers to only 100-135MBps. Yuk.\n\nThis also means that the 1TB version would’ve turned in a much slower 450GB write time and not come close to the top spot in the chart.\n\nThis is not the pace you want to see. And you probably won’t if you write less than 40GB at a time and space out operations normally. Note that the drive already contained 450GB of data written at a far brisker canter.\n\nThe secondary caching seemed dynamic, but only in limited fashion. Once laden with 450GB of data, subsequent 48GB writes proceeded at top speed, but much more than that, and they dropped again to the native write rate.\n\nNote that I left the drive alone for a full day before said subsequent writes, so there was plenty of time for the controller to allot more QLC as secondary cache.\n\nThe MP44Q’s CrystalDiskMark 8 sequential transfer numbers are very good, second only to the Lexar NM790. The Kingston NV3 and WD SN770, also PCIe 4.0/HMB SSDs, proved no match in this test.\n\nThe MP44Q was very solid in CrystalDiskMark 8’s sequential transfer tests. Longer bars are better.\n\nThe MP44Q was solid in all four CrystalDiskMark 8 4K tests, allowing it to top the NM790 in the aggregate, thanks to the latter’s horrible 4K write performance.\n\nThe MP44Q was solid in all four CrystalDiskMark 8 4K tests, allowing it to top the NM790 in the aggregate due to the latter’s horrible single-queue performance. Longer bars are better.\n\nThe MP44Q was a hair off the Lexar NM790 in the 48GB transfers — a subjectively unnoticeable difference.\n\nThe MP44Q was a hair off the Lexar NM790 in the 48GB transfers — a subjectively unnoticeable difference. Shorter bars are better.\n\nAlthough, not up to the Kingston NV3 in the 450GB write test, the MP44Q did shave a couple of seconds off the Lexar NM790’s time — making up for the two seconds it lost in the 48GB transfers.\n\nAlthough, not up to the Kingston NV3 in the 450GB write test, the MP44Q did shave a couple of seconds off the Lexar NM790’s time. Making up for the two seconds it lost in the 48GB transfers. Shorter bars are better.\n\nAlthough the CrystalDiskMark 8 numbers weren’t breathtaking, the MP44Q’s overall performance under most circumstances impressed us. Bear in mind that few users will stress an SSD with contiguous 450GB writes as we do.\n\nShould I buy the Teamgroup MP44Q?\n\nIf you’re not going to write massive amounts of data on a regular basis, then the MP44Q will get the job done, and get it done for less money than just about anything else on the market. The TBW rating is fantastic for a QLC drive as well.\n\nBut if you do write a ton of data, look for a fast TLC model with better sustained performance such as the WD SN770.\n\n\n\nHow we test\n\nDrive tests currently utilize Windows 11, 64-bit running on a Z790 (PCIe 4.0/5.0) motherboard/i5-12400 CPU combo with two Kingston Fury 32GB DDR5 4800MHz modules (64GB of memory total). Both 20Gbps USB and Thunderbolt 4 are integrated to the back panel and Intel CPU/GPU graphics are used. The 48GB transfer tests utilize an ImDisk RAM disk taking up 58GB of the 64GB of total memory. The 450GB file is transferred from a 2TB Samsung 990 Pro which also runs the OS.\n\nEach test is performed on a newly NTFS-formatted and TRIM’d drive so the results are optimal. Note that in normal use, as a drive fills up, performance may decrease due to less NAND for secondary caching, as well as other factors. This can be less of a factor with the current crop of SSDs with far faster late-generation NAND.\n\nCaveat: The performance numbers shown apply only to the drive we were shipped and to the capacity tested. SSD performance can and will vary by capacity due to more or fewer chips to shotgun reads/writes across and the amount of NAND available for secondary caching. Vendors also occasionally swap components. If you ever notice a large discrepancy between the performance you experience and that which we report, by all means, let us know."}

Taking the launch-day benchmarks from October with the same hardware, we are revisiting the Intel Arrow Lake performance under Linux today using the newest system BIOS and the newly-released Ubuntu 25.04 for seeing how the performance has evolved roughly over the past half-year.\n\nI'll say right off the bat that the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K performance has improved a lot under Linux since launch. More than I anticipated going into these days. Since last October I have reported on various Linux kernel optimizations specific to helping out the newest Intel processors from P-State driver optimizations to other P/E core hybrid adjustments and more. Plus there have been various general Linux kernel optimizations too over this time. And then there's also been new BIOS releases designed to help with the performance of Arrow Lake desktop processors. I've shown off some of these improvements individually in prior Phoronix articles while today's redux comparison is the original launch-day data up against the newest Linux software stack and system BIOS.\n\nThe hardware was the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K 24-core processor, the ASUS ROG MAXIMUS Z890 HERO motherboard, 2 x 32GB DDR5-6400 Corsair CMK64GX5M2B6400C32 memory (XMP I memory profile as the only system BIOS adjustment made for launch day and repeated on the new system BIOS defaults), 2TB Corsair MP700 PRO NVMe SSD, and Radeon RX 7900 GRE graphics. For the ASUS system BIOS it was jumping from v0503 to v1603 as the newest release as of repeating these tests. As stated, XMP memory profile was the only BIOS change made each time -- just making that clear since completely separate has been some news this week around the \"200S Boost\" overclocking profile feature beginning to roll-out on new BIOSes... This feature was not used/tested as part of this article or any changes along those lines, just coincidental timing with Intel happen to be announcing the feature on the same day as this article being in the publishing queue.\n\nBack for launch-day testing was on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS while upgrading to the Linux 6.10 Git kernel of the time. Now as of last week Ubuntu 25.04 is now available with the Linux 6.14 kernel, GCC 14.2 compiler, and other software upgrades compared to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.\n\nThis is quite a straight-forward round of tests with using the same hardware and simply wanting to see where software changes since October have influenced the Core Ultra 9 285K desktop performance on Linux. The CPU power consumption was also monitored then and now for seeing what sort of difference may be there for power efficiency too.\n\nLet's see how Core Ultra 9 Arrow Lake is looking for Q2'2025."}

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead\n\nAs content creators across the web get swept up into discussions of tariffs and a potential recession, some are adjusting their approach to avoid possible blowback from affected fans.\n\nWith Donald Trump’s currently-paused tariffs (save China) threatening to send the global economy into a recession, content creators of all kinds are chiming in, regardless of their usual lane. In addition to the usual suspects in the worlds of investing and personal finance, there are comedians making humor videos about markets crashing, lifestyle influencers posting about recession indicators and political creators making the economy their primary focus in 2025.\n\nAmid the frenzy, some creators are wary of making videos about the potential recession — particularly those who saw what happened to other creators during the most recent financial crash in 2022. Back then, an entire cottage industry of personal finance influencers arose largely to promote and discuss cryptocurrency investing, only to face backlash and a reputation hit from hordes of angry fans after their advice didn’t pan out.\n\nFor better or worse, creators believe that anyone who posts about the recession in 2025 should be ready to handle potential backlash, particularly if any of their fans interpret their videos as advice and get burned as a result.\n\nCreator and influencer talent manager Maddy Carty, for example, told Digiday that she had advised her clients to focus their recession videos on how the financial situation impacts their specific niche, rather than attempting to share financial information with their audiences that could be interpreted as advice.\n\n“If it’s just chucking more content into the void, that isn’t responsible — it’s not ethical,” she said. “I think it can be quite short-sighted, especially as things change quickly.“\n\nPolitical creator Adam Mockler said that he regularly turns to journalistic sources such as the Financial Times and Bloomberg to inform his work and avoid sharing misinformation, and that he plans to begin directly citing articles and data sources in a bid to raise viewers’ confidence in his recession and tariff videos.\n\n“In my videos, I’m always like, ‘I can’t give financial advice, but don’t panic,’” said Mockler, who is employed by the media company MeidasTouch and boasts nearly 1.2 million subscribers on his personal YouTube channel. “I always try to make sure that people are calm, and I’d like to think that I do a bit more tariff analysis than most channels.”\n\nU.S. laws forbid anyone with a financial license from sharing personalized financial advice on the web, which means most online creators who make finance content are, by definition, not certified financial planners or chartered financial analysts. As creators step up their recession-posting, it means an increased flow of unlicensed, self-taught advice into the brains of YouTube viewers.\n\n“If you are financially licensed, you cannot post on social media; you cannot say what a stock is,” said Jessica Inskip, a finance creator who gave up her licenses in 2022 to pursue a career as a creator. “Even basic education — you cannot do it.”\n\nCryptocurrency video creator Wendy “CryptoWendyO” Owusu said that other crypto creators’ past brushes with controversy had taught her to be transparent that her videos are opinion-based, rather than sharing specific financial advice. She also works closely with licensed financial professionals, to whom she refers any fan who reaches out asking for advice.\n\n“There’s a lot of opportunity for people in crypto to make money based on how hard you self-educate yourself, and how much effort you put in,” she said. “Disclosure is super easy to do; you just need to say, ‘I have this,’ or ‘I’m invested here,’ or ‘this was paid,’ or whatever it is.”\n\nIn 2025, content creators’ videos about the economy have skyrocketed in viewership. Over the past year, tariff-related videos by U.S. creators generated 1.1 billion non-unique views on YouTube, with 922 million coming after Jan. 1, 2025, according to data shared by Tubular Labs. During the week between March 31 and April 6, viewership of tariff-related videos on YouTube peaked at over 236 million total views.\n\n“TV news publishers like CNN, MSNBC and Fox News have been the dominant creators around tariff-related content thus far, just by way of having wall-to-wall coverage about current events that they can parse out as individual videos,” said Tubular Labs director of product marketing Erica Ortega. “But other, smaller creators like Valuetainment, PPR Mundial and MeidasTouch have generated millions of tariff-related views by publishing a lot of videos specifically on the topic,” Ortega said. “Others, like [automotive creator] Piston Pundit, have also leaned into educating their audience about how tariffs impact their specific industry.”"}

But connection issues and comparably lackluster 40Gbps performance left me unamazed. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nThe Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 is a handsome, rugged, relatively affordable external SSD with 40Gbps aspirations. I say aspirations because several times it connected at only 10Gbps or 5Gbps on our test bed before a BIOS update. However, even when connected at 40Gbps, it was slightly slower than the competition.\n\nRead on to learn more, then see our roundup of the best external drives for comparison.\n\nWhat are the Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4’s features?\n\nThe Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 is noticeably larger than the older Extreme Pro SSDs, though it mimics them absolutely in shape, style, and color. The drive is a rather hefty 5.4–inches long, by 2.2–inches wide, by 0.45-inches thick, and weighs around 5.4 ounces. Lest you mistake my intent, I like solid and hefty in an external SSD.\n\nAs you can see below, it’s Sandisk’s favorite dark gray with copper highlighting in the extra large lanyard opening. It’s largely covering in textured silicone, which provides a nice, comfortable grip.\n\nthe Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 on its side.\n\nObviously, the Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 uses the USB4 protocol and it’s of the high-end 40Gbps variety. USB4 does allow 20Gbps implementations, though we haven’t seen any drives using it. USB4 v2 will implement 80Gbps like Thunderbolt 5, but SSDs featuring that are a ways off. Thunderbolt 5 SSDs can be counted with the fingers on one hand at the moment.\n\nSandisk warranties the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 for a full five years, though that’s no doubt mitigated by its TBW rating. Sandisk didn’t say that explicitly, but it’s standard to condition the warranty on a maximum number of terabytes that can written to the drive, along with reasonable handling such as not dropping it from a skyscraper, splitting it with an axe, etc.\n\nAs the write speed only dropped to 550MBps off secondary cache, I’m assuming it uses TLC memory, which is normally rated at 600TBW per terabyte of capacity.\n\nHow much is the Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4?\n\nThe Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 is available in a 2TB model for $280 and a 4TB model for $430. That’s in line with the pre-populated competition such as the Adata SE920 and OWC 1M2, but not nearly the bargain that is the Corsair EX400U.\n\nYou can also roll your own for considerably less with something like the Ugreen CM642. But of course, you have the bother of opening and installing the SSD. In total, price is not an issue with the Extreme SSD Pro SSD with USB4 (Geez, I’m getting tired of typing that name!). But there were issues.\n\nHow fast is the Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4?\n\nWhen it operated at full speed, the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 drive was fast, albeit not as fast as the competition — it placed last among some very fast USB4 SSDs. In our real-world transfer tests, it also fell behind a couple of 20Gbps SSDs. Additionally, it had issues connecting at full speed on our test bed.\n\nUsing the supplied cable (40Gbps logo’d) the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 operated at only 10Gbps on one of our test bed’s Thunderbolt 4 ports, and 5Gbps on the other. Windows also warned that the drive might not perform as USB4 should. Using the same cable on an M4 Mac Studio’s Thunderbolt 5 port gave the full 40Gbps.\n\nUsing a super high-quality Thunderbolt 5 cable, the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 was able to perform and complete testing at 40Gbps on the PCWorld test bed. However, a second attempt with the same Thunderbolt 5 cable produced the reduced speeds.\n\nNote that USB4 (a marriage of Thunderbolt 4 and USB) is still in its infancy, so interoperability issues aren’t startling, though these are the first I’ve experienced. The drive might perform substantially better and connect more reliably on other systems. It did on my Mac Studio.\n\nIt might be incompatibility with our test bed’s Thunderbolt 4 implementation, but I’ve never seen this from any other USB4 product. Eventually, a BIOS update seemed to cure the issue, but we’re loathe to change our test bed after 100 drives tested and the issue might still affect other users. As I said, no other USB4 device has every failed to connect at full speed.\n\nWhen connected at the full 40Gbps, you can see that the Sandisk Extreme Pro with USB4 was largely in line with, if not quite up to the competition in CrystalDiskMark 8’s sequential tests.\n\nThe major weakness was in single-queue/thread writing, which is the way Windows operates. These weakness showed up on other tests.\n\nThe Sandisk Extreme Pro with USB4 was largely in tune with, if not quite up to the competition in CrystalDiskMark 8’s sequential tests. Its major weakness was in single queue/thread writing. Longer bars are better.\n\nIn CrystalDiskMark 8’s random 4K tests, the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 was, again, largely up to snuff with the competition, except for the very disappointing single-thread write score. There’s a theme here.\n\nWe repeated the single-queue, single-thread test several times to make sure it wasn’t an aberration. It might have something to do with secondary cache management as the score doubled when I ran it on its own. However, 40MBps is still considerably slower than the competition.\n\nIn CrystalDiskMark 8’s random 4K tests, the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 was, again, largely up to snuff with the competition, except for the very disappointing single thread write score. Longer bars are better.\n\nAgain, Windows only uses a single queue and thread (despite NVMe being a decade old now) for writing data, so it’s not surprising that the Extreme Pro SSD with USB was off the pace. It was actually slower in this test than several 20Gbps USB 3.2×2 SSDs.\n\nAgain, Windows only uses a single queue and thread, so it’s not surprising that the Extreme Pro SSD with USB was off the pace. Shorter bars are better.\n\nWhile not tragic, the Sandisk Extreme Pro with USB4’s 450GB write performance was middling at best. Close to three minutes slower than the SE920 and, again, slower than several 20Gbps SSDs.\n\nWhile not tragic, the Sandisk Extreme Pro with USB4’s 450GB write performance was middling at best. Shorter bars are better.\n\nI was a bit surprised that Sandisk didn’t pull more speed out of this unit. But the company isn’t quite as good with external SSDs as it is with internal ones. And this is not the first Sandisk SSD to have connection issues.\n\nNote that most SSDs are capable of their advertised speed — on certain systems. AMD’s Thunderbolt 4 implementation is faster than Intel’s. Our test bed is Intel, which we’ve kept static over more than 100 external and internal SSD tests. All the drives we’ve tested have had the same “handicap.”\n\nShould you buy the Sandisk Extreme Pro with USB4?\n\nThe Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 is handsome, rugged, feels great in your mitts, is decently affordable for USB4, and is faster than the majority of USB 3.2×2 20Gbps SSDs.\n\nThat said, the connection issues might affect some users, and the 40Gbps competition is faster.\n\nThis article was edited on April 25, 2025 to add the news that an updated test bed seemed to cure the connection issues. There are PCs out there though that might still be affected.\n\nHow we test"}

Why the Numbers Don’t Add Up\n\nWhen Hugo Ekitike’s name surfaced again as a potential Liverpool forward target, fans were predictably split. But Dave Davis, speaking on The Transfer Show, offered a cold, analytical perspective. “This player is not worth the €100 million – he’s just not,” Davis stated flatly.\n\nThe forward, currently at Eintracht Frankfurt, has caught attention with his speed and raw potential. But Davis was quick to stress that all the noise is coming from one side: “All the noises on Ekitike are from his agent’s side… there’s nothing solid you can get from the club side.”\n\nWhile some fans are keen to see Liverpool add another promising forward to their ranks, the scars of recent misfires run deep. “We’ve just been bitten by a project forward spending big money on pace,” Davis said pointedly. “They are not going to repeat it.”\n\nValue or Vanity? The Striker Profile Liverpool Actually Want\n\nThe Ekitike conversation plays into a broader theme that Davis and Downey explored: Liverpool’s desire for attacking reinforcements, but not at any price. “If Liverpool were going to spend that money on a forward – and that would not surprise me – it is not going to be on Hugo Ekitike,” Davis clarified. “If that price is true, get your pen out and put a line through that name.”\n\nThe realistic valuation Davis floated was “around the €50–60 million mark,” but even that, he hinted, felt generous based on current performance levels. “He’s quick, he’s got a few goals, raw tools – no doubts about it. But he’s not a €100 million player.”\n\nThat kind of outlay would demand a surefire impact player, not another gamble on potential. “This is not a Mo Salah situation,” Davis emphasised. “Liverpool want someone who’s ready to go, not someone they need to develop all over again.”\n\nAlternatives and Aspirations\n\nThroughout the podcast, other striker names came and went – Sesko, Delap, even Victor Osimhen and Julian Alvarez were mused over during broader transfer discussions. But none felt imminent. “We’re priced out of a lot of these,” Trev Downey observed. “But people are manifesting, rubbing their temples.”\n\nLiverpool’s focus seems clear: wait for value, avoid hype, and ignore the noise. “No more project forwards,” Davis insisted. “If they move, it’ll be for a ready-made forward who fits the system and hits the ground running.”\n\nThe comparison was direct and sobering: “We talked about Nunez, we’ve seen what happens when you spend big and the development doesn’t come quickly. That’s not happening again.”\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThe Hugo Ekitike speculation is the perfect storm of agent-driven buzz, fan hope, and journalistic filler. But as Dave Davis made clear on The Transfer Show, Liverpool are past the point of wishful thinking. If a striker arrives, it will be one with experience, not excuses.\n\nEkitike, for all his promise, is not the man. The price is wrong, the risk is high, and Liverpool’s transfer model under Arne Slot and Michael Edwards just doesn’t stretch to another multi-million gamble with no guarantees.\n\nDavis summed it up best: “If that price is true for Ekitike – put a line through that name.”"}

It wasn’t their slickest display—nor did it need to be. In April, points outweigh polish, and Trent’s goal, his first-ever with his left foot, was a timely reminder of his enduring class.\n\nYet beneath the jubilation lies a more nuanced subplot. As Liverpool prepare for life under Arne Slot with the title within touching distance, the conversation around who holds the future of the right-back position at Anfield is gaining momentum. Conor Bradley, the 21-year-old from Northern Ireland, is at the heart of it.\n\nBradley Shows Promise But Faces Familiar Questions\n\nBradley has been given a considerable run in the side recently, deputising for the oft-injured and tactically rotated Alexander-Arnold. His performances have been broadly impressive, with flashes of maturity and sharp tactical understanding. Still, not everyone is convinced the future is entirely his just yet.\n\nSpeaking on The Rest Is Football, former England international Micah Richards struck a measured tone:\n\n“I think in the wider context it was nice to see Conor Bradley as well to see what he could bring to this team potentially going forward, do they need to sign a right-back, will he be second in command?”\n\nRichards didn’t hesitate to highlight the positive elements of Bradley’s game:\n\n“But I think he’s got something special as well, in a different way. He’s more aggressive defensively but still makes really intelligent runs, more inside than outside. I liked the link up with him and Salah today as well and I think he’s got a real chance.”\n\nYet, he was also honest about the uncertainties:\n\n“I think the question mark is whether he’s going to be the number one. I think he’s got all the attributes to do that but that is the one question mark that Liverpool fans will be asking.”\n\nAlexander-Arnold’s Future Adds to the Intrigue\n\nWhat complicates matters further is the status of Trent Alexander-Arnold. His contract situation remains unresolved, and despite delivering when called upon—as his goal against Leicester showed—his role in the team continues to shift.\n\nThe 26-year-old has evolved beyond the traditional right-back mould. His influence stems more from his distribution and vision than pure defensive solidity, and under Slot, there’s a real possibility he could be moved permanently into midfield—a role he’s often flirted with.\n\nThis potential reshuffle makes Bradley’s development all the more critical. But is he the heir, or merely the apprentice?\n\nRight-Back Position Hinges on Summer Decisions\n\nGary Lineker, weighing in on the debate, pointed to the stylistic contrast between the two players:\n\n“It’s a tough act to follow but I think it probably helps him that he’s a totally different style of full-back to Trent.”\n\n“He’s not got the passing range, but he’s got great energy, gets up and down, gets crosses in, his runs are really good. I suppose for Liverpool they’ll probably look at a right-back anyway as back-up because he would have been the back-up to Trent before, I don’t know.”\n\nIndeed, Liverpool’s transfer strategy this summer will reveal a great deal. Do they trust Bradley to mature into the role, perhaps with an experienced back-up behind him? Or will they look for a more established right-back, effectively pushing the youngster back down the pecking order?\n\nWhat’s evident is that Liverpool have two very different profiles in Alexander-Arnold and Bradley—each offering unique benefits, each raising valid questions. One is a proven creative force with a Champions League medal in his pocket; the other, a determined upstart with raw tools and the potential to become a mainstay.\n\nSlot’s first full season will likely be shaped, in part, by how he balances that equation."}

Why the Rumour Doesn’t Add Up\n\nLiverpool’s name will always be linked with high-profile talents, especially when transfer windows loom large. But not every rumour carries the same weight, and when seasoned voices start to question the logic of a move, it’s worth sitting up and listening.\n\nIn a recent conversation with Dave Davis, respected journalist David Lynch cast serious doubt over the Reds’ reported interest in Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike – and his analysis offers a clear-eyed take on the narrative many fans have run away with.\n\nConcerns Over Ekitike’s Readiness\n\nEkitike is undeniably talented, but talent alone doesn’t justify a price tag north of £86 million. Liverpool, under the new stewardship of Arne Slot, will be evolving – but there remains a discernible method to how they build.\n\nLynch was candid in his assessment: “I don’t see it at all. I’ve been sceptical about this move for a while now and I think he’s definitely someone Liverpool will be keeping an eye on but in terms of them progressing with it, I’m getting increasingly sceptical.”\n\nThere’s a difference between monitoring a player and being ready to commit significant resources. And that’s where much of this talk feels speculative rather than strategic.\n\nFrom Nunez to Ekitike? Not Logical\n\nLet’s be clear: Darwin Nunez remains a polarising figure. His explosive pace and unpredictability offer chaos in the final third, yet inconsistency remains a shadow over his game. However, suggesting that Hugo Ekitike, who is even less proven at top-level football, could be a viable alternative borders on fantasy.\n\nAs Lynch put it, “He’s so raw and to go from Darwin Nunez to him would be like going out the frying pan and into the fire with him.” This isn’t just colourful language – it’s a blunt footballing truth. Replacing one erratic forward with another who’s even less tested, especially in the intensity of the Premier League, doesn’t align with the club’s historically shrewd recruitment.\n\nLiverpool have shown time and again that they invest in players when the data, character and timing all align. It’s no coincidence they were patient with Diogo Jota and shrewd with the timing of Cody Gakpo’s arrival. Ekitike doesn’t seem to fit that pattern – not yet, at least.\n\nAgent-Driven Noise or Genuine Interest?\n\nLynch’s remarks also peeled back the curtain on how transfer narratives often emerge. “I haven’t been given any encouragement on the name by anyone on Liverpool’s side, so I’m not convinced,” he admitted, before adding: “I know a lot of the talk is agent driven and if Liverpool had decided that they were his priority, they would be wanting all of this talk to not be out there.”\n\nThat’s a critical insight into how modern football operates. Agents often use big names like Liverpool to inflate interest or price tags – especially when a young player’s future is uncertain. If the Reds were genuinely chasing Ekitike, it’s far more likely they’d be working under the radar, as they have with so many previous deals.\n\nSlot, alongside the club’s data-focused recruitment team, will not be swayed by hype. In fact, any suggestion of a £100 million outlay on a striker with limited top-tier experience seems diametrically opposed to how FSG have historically operated.\n\nStrategic Rebuild, Not Reactive Spending\n\nIt’s worth contextualising all of this in the wider picture. Liverpool are entering a new era post-Klopp, with Slot tasked with building on the German’s legacy. That rebuild will be methodical, considered, and – above all – smart. There’s no rush to splash for the sake of headlines.\n\nLynch’s scepticism mirrors what many in and around Liverpool have quietly sensed: Ekitike might be on the radar, but he’s not the solution. Not now, and not at that price.\n\nIn a summer that could define Slot’s Liverpool tenure, prioritising ready-made players who can seamlessly fit into the club’s tactical and cultural ecosystem will be key. If Ekitike ever becomes that player, it won’t be on the back of tabloid whispers or agent-fuelled chatter.\n\nFor now, fans would do well to focus less on the rumour mill and more on the steady evolution of a squad designed to compete – not chase shadows."}

As Davis put it, “The drop-off right now between the two is big for me.”\n\nThe underlying issue, Davis added, may come down to Liverpool’s financial threshold. “This could be the contract till the suits die on… they can’t just keep giving everyone almost a deal and we keep busting and busting that.” He went further: “They’ll know the implications of that when they’re trying to negotiate this contract with Conor Bradley.”\n\nHato and Huijsen: Big Decisions, Big Talent\n\nAmidst the uncertainty around Konaté, Liverpool’s attention is seemingly drawn to the emerging centre-back market, with both Jorrel Hato and Dean Huijsen featuring heavily in recent scouting conversations. But there’s competition. “Chelsea are in for Hato and Huijsen,” Davis confirmed, before revealing a twist. “They [Chelsea] think they’re almost out the race for Huijsen… they think it’s Liverpool and Arsenal if it’s Premier League for Huijsen.”\n\nThat would be a significant boost for Liverpool, but Davis warned: “Don’t be surprised if Chelsea move hard for Hato. They’ve pivoted already.” While Liverpool seem to favour Huijsen, Davis admitted the club’s internal analysis suggests Hato may be “a bit too soon to bring straight into our lineup.”\n\nWith centre-backs developing later and pressure mounting around potential departures, Davis made it clear: “I think we need another fifth experienced centre-half who we can plug and play straight away… otherwise, it’s a bit of a worry.”\n\nChelsea’s Transfer Shadow: Familiar Names, Familiar Tactics\n\nDavis didn’t shy away from the increasingly common overlap between Chelsea and Liverpool’s transfer targets. “Everything that we’re doing almost seems a little bit intertwined with Chelsea,” he observed, “I never thought I’d say this – I think Sweeney Todd is copying Richard Hughes and Michael Edwards’ homework.”\n\nLiverpool fans will remember many transfer sagas with Chelsea. Davis added an intriguing anecdote: “Chelsea went in for Van Dijk… and we were just like, ‘Go away.’” The refusal, delivered with satisfying bluntness, was met with glee on the show: “That was brilliant to hear… just because of who it is and who the player is.”\n\nStill, the rivalry doesn’t stop there. “Jamie Gittens – Chelsea are in, but Liverpool are watching closely too,” Davis confirmed. That competition is set to intensify if prices fall within Liverpool’s ‘sweet spot.’\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nDave Davis’ key message was clear: Liverpool can’t afford another summer of dithering. Whether it’s Huijsen or Hato, the Konaté decision is pivotal. Letting the Frenchman walk due to wage limitations, only to thrust a raw replacement like Huijsen into the cauldron, would be a high-risk move.\n\nAnd with Chelsea looming large, boasting financial bravado and long-term contracts that Liverpool won’t match, it’s a fight that won’t wait for internal harmony.\n\nAs Davis concluded, “The easiest option is just get Ibou renewed – and then everyone’s happy. But I am worried this is the one that the line is drawn on.”"}

With Arne Slot’s side on the verge of a record-equalling 20th league crown, Sunday’s fixture could mark a defining chapter in the club’s illustrious story.\n\nOnly Arsenal’s midweek clash with Crystal Palace holds the power to delay Liverpool’s potential title celebration. But regardless of results elsewhere, there’s a sense that the Kop is ready to erupt. Anfield, ever imposing and unrelenting, has not witnessed a league defeat to Spurs in 14 meetings. History and form both lean red.\n\nFor Tottenham, it’s a different narrative. Languishing in 16th place and having lost more than half of their league games, the season has unravelled. Their defensive record reads like a warning light—51 goals conceded, numerous points squandered, and faith in a top-half finish dwindling.\n\nPostecoglou Carefully Managing Injured Stars\n\nAnge Postecoglou arrives at Anfield hoping to avoid another heavy blow, but his hands may be tied. After the 2-1 defeat to Nottingham Forest, the Australian offered insight into the state of his squad—particularly defensive lynchpins Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero, both of whom have struggled with hamstring injuries throughout the campaign.\n\n“I thought they needed to play some minutes tonight because it becomes 10 days leading into Liverpool. With both of them we’ve got them in a really good place physically now and I just want to keep them ticking over,” Postecoglou told Football London.\n\n“I felt that there was no need to play more than 45 minutes today and we needed to get a couple of others game time.”\n\nIn what seems a pragmatic yet cautious approach, the Spurs boss added: “I just felt that if it was Sunday we probably wouldn’t have played them, but on a Monday, especially for Micky because he’s been playing just one game a week, we need to build him up because he’s in a really good place at the moment so I thought 45 minutes for both of them would be beneficial.”\n\nUdogie and Maddison Also Eased Back\n\nIt wasn’t just the centre-backs being managed. Destiny Udogie and James Maddison, two of Spurs’ more influential performers, were also kept out of the Forest defeat as Postecoglou prioritised freshness ahead of the Liverpool clash.\n\n“Destiny was fine. We just left him out of the squad tonight. He put in a big physical shift on Thursday and the idea was always to rest him,” he explained.\n\n“I wasn’t going to put him on so there was no point in putting him on the bench. Madders was pretty sore yesterday but in the last 24 hours, he recovered and was keen to be on the bench. They’re both fine.”\n\nAnfield Awaits with Expectations and Tension\n\nThe significance of this fixture cannot be overstated. For Liverpool, it’s an opportunity to place their name in the history books under new leadership. Slot’s arrival marked a fresh beginning—and now, with the title in reach, his work may be rewarded with silverware and a symbolic handover from the Klopp era.\n\nFor Spurs, Sunday offers a rare chance to salvage pride and play spoiler. But the odds—form, fitness, and psychological weight—are stacked heavily against them.\n\nLiverpool are not just fighting for three points—they’re chasing immortality. Postecoglou, meanwhile, must hope that a patched-up defence and a spark of belief can delay the coronation."}

It’s not happening. We’re not like that.”\n\nStill, the fact that De Bruyne is being talked about in Liverpool circles shows the desperation for creativity in midfield – and just how much his City future has drifted into uncertainty.\n\nGittens Move a Possibility if Price Is Right\n\nOf all the emerging talents discussed, Jamie Gittens appears the most likely to land in Liverpool’s plans – but only if the numbers work. The Borussia Dortmund winger, still just 20, has been scouted extensively by Liverpool, according to Davis.\n\n“Explosive… one of the quickest players in the Bundesliga,” Davis said, referencing Dortmund’s public speed data. “Liverpool have had a hard look – and if the price comes down, don’t be surprised if they move.”\n\nThe sticking point so far? Dortmund’s valuation. “When the price was quoted, it was like ‘not a chance.’ But if it comes to that Liverpool sweet spot around the £40 million zone, they’ll be back in.”\n\nIt’s not a done deal by any stretch, but Gittens fits the FSG mould – young, high ceiling, and mouldable. “There’s a lot of raw materials there to work with,” Davis added, suggesting he’d be a project player rather than an immediate starter.\n\nCherki Still a YouTube Dream, Not a Slot System Fit\n\nRayan Cherki’s name refuses to go away. Another week, another viral highlight reel, another wave of calls from fans to make a move. But as Davis explained, the hype doesn’t match Liverpool’s reality.\n\n“Whenever you ask around about Cherki, you kind of get an ‘Oh my God, has this name come up again?’” Davis said. “Liverpool have watched him, of course, but if they wanted to do it, they could have by now. Around £25 million would get it done.”\n\nSo why hasn’t it happened? “When you look at all his metrics… Mo Salah looks like Gattuso compared to Cherki,” Davis quipped. “You’re essentially defending with nine if Cherki and Salah are on the pitch.”\n\nIt’s not just the stats. There are whispers about his attitude too, although as Davis admitted, “No one ever really knows – the stories are coming out of France.” But in a squad where work rate is non-negotiable under Arne Slot, Cherki may be a non-starter.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nLiverpool’s transfer focus is often clinical, but the chatter around De Bruyne, Gittens, and Cherki shows how perception and practicality clash in summer planning. De Bruyne is a legend – but the wage demands and age make a deal impossible. Gittens is raw but promising – the type of player Liverpool can sculpt. Cherki remains a dazzling wildcard that simply doesn’t fit the system.\n\nAs Dave Davis put it, “If the price comes down, Liverpool are back being interested… but they won’t bend their model for anyone.”"}

Following Liverpool’s 1-0 win over Leicester City, it’s not just results that suggest the title is within reach, it’s the tone of their captain.\n\n“It’s a great feeling to be in this position, something we don’t take for granted,” said Van Dijk. Liverpool’s 13-point lead at the top of the Premier League, with five games remaining, means they could be crowned champions as early as Wednesday night should Arsenal slip up against Crystal Palace. If not, Sunday’s clash with Tottenham at Anfield presents a crowning opportunity.\n\nWhat stands out in Van Dijk’s post-match words is an emphasis not on celebration, but on preparation. “We’ve got a week to prepare. If anything happens on Wednesday then happy days, if not then we have to finish it off and we have to be at our best to do that.”\n\nBig Moments Define Big Teams\n\nThis season hasn’t been without its stumbles — a narrow loss at Brentford, late drama in Newcastle — but Liverpool have developed a sense of inevitability. The 1-0 win at Leicester wasn’t spectacular, but it was commanding. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s decisive strike, following a barrage of 28 shots and nearly 60% possession, was less an act of desperation and more one of destiny.\n\n“It’s been, in my opinion, an outstanding season,” Van Dijk reflected. “A lot of good moments actually, a lot of wins and good performances.” This wasn’t bravado. It was an honest assessment of a team that has controlled its own narrative.\n\nHistory Beckons at Anfield\n\nIf — or when — Liverpool clinch the title, it will be Van Dijk lifting the Premier League trophy. “Of course, I can’t deny it, I would lie to you if [I said] it didn’t cross my mind,” he admitted.\n\nBut the moment is not yet the focus. “We have worked so hard to be in this position throughout the whole season, we have been so consistent… Now we have a big opportunity – because it’s an opportunity, nothing else – to finish it off.”\n\nVan Dijk will become only the 11th Liverpool captain to lift the English league title — a feat that echoes through Anfield’s illustrious past. From Emlyn Hughes to Jordan Henderson, that honour isn’t merely historic. It is symbolic of leadership at the highest level.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nIf you’re a Liverpool supporter, this week is wrapped in anticipation. Not nervousness, but expectation. Virgil van Dijk embodies what fans want from a captain: calm, belief, and steel in the spine. His words are as precise as his passing — deliberate, reflective, but laser-focused.\n\nSupporters can feel the crescendo coming. After months of graft, a patchwork of gritty away wins and stylish home displays, this isn’t just about silverware. It’s about vindication. For the players. For the new manager. For the supporters who backed a new era.\n\nSlot’s subtle tweaks have gone under the radar, but the impact is clear — this side is flexible, resilient, and most importantly, united. Trent’s goal at Leicester wasn’t just a winner, it was a sign that roles can be redefined and moments can still be seized by those with big-game DNA.\n\nArsenal may yet drag it out, but make no mistake — this title has Liverpool’s fingerprints all over it. There’s a job to finish, and fans are ready to roar them over the line."}

A trip to the King Power Stadium on Easter Sunday would never be a simple task—especially with Leicester fighting to avoid relegation—but Liverpool dug deep and found their moment, thanks to a Scouser off the bench.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold, returning from injury and amid ongoing speculation over his future, delivered the decisive blow just minutes after being introduced. A 76th-minute strike, both stunning and significant, edged Liverpool to within one win of a historic 20th English league title.\n\nBelow is how the team lined up, with match details following.\n\nThe Starting Eleven\n\nGK – Alisson Becker\n\nRB – Conor Bradley\n\nRCB – Ibrahima Konaté\n\nLCB – Virgil van Dijk (c)\n\nLB – Kostas Tsimikas\n\nCM – Alexis Mac Allister\n\nACM – Dominik Szoboszlai\n\nCM – Ryan Gravenberch\n\nRF – Mohamed Salah\n\nCF – Luis Díaz\n\nLF – Cody Gakpo\n\nSubs:\n\nDiogo Jota – Cody Gakpo (60 mins)\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold – Conor Bradley (71 mins)\n\nHarvey Elliott – Dominik Szoboszlai (71 mins)\n\nCurtis Jones – Luis Díaz (90 mins)\n\nGoals (Assisted by)\n\nLeicester 0 – 1 Liverpool\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold (Unassisted, via Van Dijk header) – 76 mins\n\nImportant Match Stats\n\nPossession\n\nLeicester 42% – 58% Liverpool\n\nXG\n\nLeicester 0.27 – 2.57 Liverpool\n\nTotal Shots\n\nLeicester 5 – 28 Liverpool\n\nCorner Kicks\n\nLeicester 1 – 13 Liverpool\n\nOffsides\n\nLeicester 2 – 2 Liverpool\n\nFouls\n\nLeicester 11 – 7 Liverpool\n\nYellow Cards\n\nLeicester 1 – 2 Liverpool\n\nGoalkeeper Saves\n\nLeicester 7 – 0 Liverpool\n\nThe First Half\n\nThe first 45 minutes were defined by patience and frustration. Liverpool bossed the ball but struggled to find spaces against a compact Leicester setup. Once again, Mac Allister, the Reds’ controller in midfield, probed tirelessly, linking well with Gravenberch and Szoboszlai, but clear-cut chances were few and far between.\n\nLuis Díaz and Salah offered width, though their final ball often failed to meet its target. At the back, Van Dijk and Konaté were largely untroubled, with Jamie Vardy isolated and Leicester content to sit in and hope for transitions.\n\nDespite dominance in possession, the first half ended goalless and slightly tense for the league leaders.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/anfieldindex/status/1914308355943706727?s=46&t=rxgukmqdoXc4muVFLSx2EQ\n\nThe Second Half\n\nThe second half saw Liverpool increase the tempo. Arne Slot’s substitutions changed the dynamic, especially the introduction of Alexander-Arnold and Elliott in the 71st minute. Five minutes later, the breakthrough arrived.\n\nA corner from the right was met by Van Dijk, whose header caused chaos in the Leicester box. The ball fell kindly to Alexander-Arnold on the edge of the area, and the vice-captain unleashed a thunderous left-footed drive into the bottom corner.\n\nCue the celebration—shirt off, fists clenched, and a roar toward the travelling support. A moment that felt like more than just a winning goal; it felt like a statement of intent. Perhaps of belonging to a club that he cherishes so dearly.\n\nLeicester offered little in response, and Liverpool saw out the final stages with maturity and control, Mac Allister continuing to lead the midfield with intelligence and calm.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOn a day when Liverpool could have slipped, they instead stood tall. Alexander-Arnold’s match-winning cameo was as timely as it was brilliant, and his celebration hinted that his heart may still lie at Anfield, despite Real Madrid’s interest.\n\nMac Allister was superb throughout, dictating play and asserting dominance in midfield, but it was Trent’s moment, and potentially a defining one in the title race.\n\nLiverpool are now 13 points clear at the top with five games remaining. One more win will crown them champions.\n\nSteven Smith’s Score Prediction:\n\nLeicester 0 – 3 Liverpool"}

It's pretty low-tech, with no high-tech components in use.\n\n(Image credit: Disney Parks)\n\nAll that crushed glass eventually becomes a somewhat shiny, clean, sand-like material. \"We've got one greenhouse almost complete with pulverized glass,\" said Debbie Mola Mickler, area manager at Disney's Horticulture. \"Cast members ask me questions about it because they walk by and their natural reaction is, 'Wow, your greenhouse floor is glistening.'\"\n\n'Wow, your greenhouse floor is glistening.' Debbie Mola Mickler, area manager at Disney's Horticulture\n\nAnd that's the product produced by the glass pulverizer.\n\nThis project started when other environmental teams at Disney asked what to do with the glass, explained Jarrod Stewart, Disney's Environmental Integration Project Manager.\n\n\"Could we pulverize it? Use it potentially for road repair, other things?\" were the questions proposed to Stewart.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Check out all of our Sustainability Week 2025 content.\n\nThus began a search for a machine that could take a bottle of wine with a wax seal still around the top and a label on the front, separate it, and then safely crush the glass to disperse a sand-like material.\n\n\"I stumbled across the type of machine that we're running here that separates all those non-glass items,\" he said. \"It actually discharges the labels and all that, all that separately.\"\n\n(Image credit: Disney Parks)\n\nThe result is a sand-like material that can blend with coquina or replace mulch – no high-tech sensors required. \"There is no smart equipment on this machine whatsoever – not even in the control panel,\" Stewart said.\n\nAt the core is a patented hammer mill. \"The glass bottle is gone, but the wax is still intact, even with the drips and everything coming off of it,\" Stewart said. \"It's a very interesting percussive action… that is the patented part of the machine.\"\n\n(Image credit: Disney Parks)\n\nAs more teams across the Disney World property heard about the pilot, interest grew. Debbie Mola Mickler saw it on the news and immediately called Stewart to request a test batch for the greenhouses and the horticulture team. The catering team wanted to be included, too, offering a transportation solution: \"They said, 'You know what, our trucks are running around the property all day… We'll just drop off the full bins and pick up the empties as we're driving by,\" Stewart said.\n\nThe pulverizer's output is now used in select areas that guests can see. \"We've used it in a couple of on-stage locations,\" Stewart explained. \"One in Fort Wilderness, where it's actually replacing mulch around the food truck pad.\" In this case, it's a more permanent solution, as mulch would eventually need to be replaced due to wear and tear.\n\nBehind the scenes, Imagineering and Disney's facility teams are exploring even more uses, including non-structural concrete or footpaths. It could even end up at other Disney locations worldwide and even on the sea, courtesy of Disney Cruise Line – either with the produced sand-like material being used or with the glass being sent to be pulverized.\n\n\"The sustainability design team is determining how it can be used to work toward sustainable design goals that they have by using recycled material in construction,\" Stewart said.\n\nWhile the pulverizer remains in a backstage area, the initiative's impact is increasingly visible.\n\nHey, can we participate in this? How do we help this grow? Jarrod Stewart, Disney's Environmental Integration Project Manager\n\n\"You know, sometimes when you ask people to sort their waste into yet another, you know, separate category, they're a little hesitant, or you might get a little pushback,\" Stewart said.\n\n\"In this case, because people see it, they're identifying with the story. They want to be part of it. So we're getting calls every week of, ‘Hey, can we participate in this? How do we help this grow? ‘”\n\n(Image credit: Disney Parks)"}

U.S. same-store sales are estimated to fall 2%, with international comps mixed.\n\n“Lousy Q1 trends (-3%ish) are digested with mixed McValue success,” the bank said, but the “Ketchup trade” remains intact.\n\nAnalysts cited encouraging developments, including better QTD trends, “Minecraft, McCrispy strips,” and the rollout of a new premium lemonade. They also noted that sentiment “is starting to improve with promising drivers ahead.”\n\nAccording to the bank, the franchise-heavy model helps insulate McDonald’s from margin pressures. Wells Fargo models Q1 franchise margins of 83.4%, up 22 basis points year-over-year, and EBIT margin of 44.9%.\n\nData checks are said to have shown U.S. foot traffic decelerated in Q1, but improved in April.\n\n“April to-date traffic improved further and running at +5.0% y/y,” analysts wrote, while Bloomberg card spending also rebounded.\n\nDespite macro headwinds and soft Q1 comps, Wells Fargo reiterated its Overweight rating and $350 price target, arguing McDonald’s remains a defensive name with multiple levers for driving growth.\n\nRelated articles\n\nMcDonald’s named top Q1 earnings idea at Wells Fargo\n\nGoldman Sachs downgrades Macy’s and Torrid on macro, tariff risks\n\nCantor initiates coverage of U.S. large-cap pharma stocks: Gilead, AbbVie at Buy"}

Brokerage flagged softening advertising revenue and macro pressure on subscriptions.\n\n\n\nWhile recent acquisitions may offer some support, the firm said near-term catalysts for multiple expansion are lacking.\n\nJP Morgan’s broader caution reflects cuts of 1& to 5% to 2025 -26 revenue estimates and 1% to 10% to EBITDA across its coverage.\n\n\n\nDespite the downgrades, the firm remains bullish on names like Roblox, AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP), and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) into earnings.\n\nRelated articles\n\nAhead of Q1 JPM downgrades Frontdoor, Resideo, Ziff Davis on tariffs\n\nComerica shares downgraded by Evercore, JP Morgan on weakening outlook, valuation\n\neBay downgraded: Analyst sees ’cloudy backdrop’"}

The MUonE (Muon ON Electron elastic scattering) project—an upcoming experiment at CERN in Switzerland—aims to get to the bottom of this discrepancy. But it might also tackle another mystery: A new analysis shows that the MUonE Collaboration could potentially spot an elusive type of dark matter [1].\n\nScheduled to start later this decade, the MUonE experiment involves a high-energy muon beam that plows through a series of thin targets. Collisions in the targets produce high-energy electrons, measurements of which would help determine the muon’s magnetic moment. However, other particles will be produced in the collisions, and some of them might be dark matter, says Isaac Wang from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois.\n\nWang and his colleagues have determined the potential signal in MUonE from “inelastic dark matter.” This type of dark matter is made up of two particles: one heavy and one light. Such a combination could explain why dark matter searches have come up empty, as the light particle would be the dominant one in the Universe, while the heavy particle would be the one that interacts with normal matter. Therefore, the only way to see this type of dark matter would be to create heavy particles in high-energy collisions, like those planned for MUonE.\n\nMuons aren’t required for this dark matter search, but they have some advantages, Wang says. A muon beam provides a cleaner background than a proton beam, and it offers a larger center-of-mass energy than an electron beam. On the basis of those advantages, Wang and colleagues show that the MUonE experiment could probe a large, unexplored region of dark matter parameter space.\n\n–Michael Schirber\n\nMichael Schirber is a Corresponding Editor for Physics Magazine based in Lyon, France."}

But connection issues and comparably lackluster 40Gbps performance left me unamazed. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nThe Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 is a handsome, rugged, relatively affordable external SSD with 40Gbps aspirations. I say aspirations because several times it connected at only 10Gbps or 5Gbps on our test bed before a BIOS update. However, even when connected at 40Gbps, it was slightly slower than the competition.\n\nRead on to learn more, then see our roundup of the best external drives for comparison.\n\nWhat are the Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4’s features?\n\nThe Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 is noticeably larger than the older Extreme Pro SSDs, though it mimics them absolutely in shape, style, and color. The drive is a rather hefty 5.4–inches long, by 2.2–inches wide, by 0.45-inches thick, and weighs around 5.4 ounces. Lest you mistake my intent, I like solid and hefty in an external SSD.\n\nAs you can see below, it’s Sandisk’s favorite dark gray with copper highlighting in the extra large lanyard opening. It’s largely covering in textured silicone, which provides a nice, comfortable grip.\n\nthe Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 on its side.\n\nObviously, the Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 uses the USB4 protocol and it’s of the high-end 40Gbps variety. USB4 does allow 20Gbps implementations, though we haven’t seen any drives using it. USB4 v2 will implement 80Gbps like Thunderbolt 5, but SSDs featuring that are a ways off. Thunderbolt 5 SSDs can be counted with the fingers on one hand at the moment.\n\nSandisk warranties the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 for a full five years, though that’s no doubt mitigated by its TBW rating. Sandisk didn’t say that explicitly, but it’s standard to condition the warranty on a maximum number of terabytes that can written to the drive, along with reasonable handling such as not dropping it from a skyscraper, splitting it with an axe, etc.\n\nAs the write speed only dropped to 550MBps off secondary cache, I’m assuming it uses TLC memory, which is normally rated at 600TBW per terabyte of capacity.\n\nHow much is the Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4?\n\nThe Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 is available in a 2TB model for $280 and a 4TB model for $430. That’s in line with the pre-populated competition such as the Adata SE920 and OWC 1M2, but not nearly the bargain that is the Corsair EX400U.\n\nYou can also roll your own for considerably less with something like the Ugreen CM642. But of course, you have the bother of opening and installing the SSD. In total, price is not an issue with the Extreme SSD Pro SSD with USB4 (Geez, I’m getting tired of typing that name!). But there were issues.\n\nHow fast is the Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4?\n\nWhen it operated at full speed, the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 drive was fast, albeit not as fast as the competition — it placed last among some very fast USB4 SSDs. In our real-world transfer tests, it also fell behind a couple of 20Gbps SSDs. Additionally, it had issues connecting at full speed on our test bed.\n\nUsing the supplied cable (40Gbps logo’d) the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 operated at only 10Gbps on one of our test bed’s Thunderbolt 4 ports, and 5Gbps on the other. Windows also warned that the drive might not perform as USB4 should. Using the same cable on an M4 Mac Studio’s Thunderbolt 5 port gave the full 40Gbps.\n\nUsing a super high-quality Thunderbolt 5 cable, the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 was able to perform and complete testing at 40Gbps on the PCWorld test bed. However, a second attempt with the same Thunderbolt 5 cable produced the reduced speeds.\n\nNote that USB4 (a marriage of Thunderbolt 4 and USB) is still in its infancy, so interoperability issues aren’t startling, though these are the first I’ve experienced. The drive might perform substantially better and connect more reliably on other systems. It did on my Mac Studio.\n\nIt might be incompatibility with our test bed’s Thunderbolt 4 implementation, but I’ve never seen this from any other USB4 product. Eventually, a BIOS update seemed to cure the issue, but we’re loathe to change our test bed after 100 drives tested and the issue might still affect other users. As I said, no other USB4 device has every failed to connect at full speed.\n\nWhen connected at the full 40Gbps, you can see that the Sandisk Extreme Pro with USB4 was largely in line with, if not quite up to the competition in CrystalDiskMark 8’s sequential tests.\n\nThe major weakness was in single-queue/thread writing, which is the way Windows operates. These weakness showed up on other tests.\n\nThe Sandisk Extreme Pro with USB4 was largely in tune with, if not quite up to the competition in CrystalDiskMark 8’s sequential tests. Its major weakness was in single queue/thread writing. Longer bars are better.\n\nIn CrystalDiskMark 8’s random 4K tests, the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 was, again, largely up to snuff with the competition, except for the very disappointing single-thread write score. There’s a theme here.\n\nWe repeated the single-queue, single-thread test several times to make sure it wasn’t an aberration. It might have something to do with secondary cache management as the score doubled when I ran it on its own. However, 40MBps is still considerably slower than the competition.\n\nIn CrystalDiskMark 8’s random 4K tests, the Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 was, again, largely up to snuff with the competition, except for the very disappointing single thread write score. Longer bars are better.\n\nAgain, Windows only uses a single queue and thread (despite NVMe being a decade old now) for writing data, so it’s not surprising that the Extreme Pro SSD with USB was off the pace. It was actually slower in this test than several 20Gbps USB 3.2×2 SSDs.\n\nAgain, Windows only uses a single queue and thread, so it’s not surprising that the Extreme Pro SSD with USB was off the pace. Shorter bars are better.\n\nWhile not tragic, the Sandisk Extreme Pro with USB4’s 450GB write performance was middling at best. Close to three minutes slower than the SE920 and, again, slower than several 20Gbps SSDs.\n\nWhile not tragic, the Sandisk Extreme Pro with USB4’s 450GB write performance was middling at best. Shorter bars are better.\n\nI was a bit surprised that Sandisk didn’t pull more speed out of this unit. But the company isn’t quite as good with external SSDs as it is with internal ones. And this is not the first Sandisk SSD to have connection issues.\n\nNote that most SSDs are capable of their advertised speed — on certain systems. AMD’s Thunderbolt 4 implementation is faster than Intel’s. Our test bed is Intel, which we’ve kept static over more than 100 external and internal SSD tests. All the drives we’ve tested have had the same “handicap.”\n\nShould you buy the Sandisk Extreme Pro with USB4?\n\nThe Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 is handsome, rugged, feels great in your mitts, is decently affordable for USB4, and is faster than the majority of USB 3.2×2 20Gbps SSDs.\n\nThat said, the connection issues might affect some users, and the 40Gbps competition is faster.\n\nThis article was edited on April 25, 2025 to add the news that an updated test bed seemed to cure the connection issues.

A good deal of my interest stems from deep concerns about the effects of misleading views about who these deeply emotional and sentient creatures truly are, for their well-being out in nature, and perhaps especially about what happens to them when they're kept in captivity as companion animals. These are among the many reasons why I was excited to learn about Stephen S. Hall's new book, Slither: How Nature's Most Maligned Creatures Illuminate Our World. I was pleased that he could take the time to answer some questions about his eye-opening, fact-filled book that offers a \"naturalistic, cultural, ecological, and scientific meditation on these loathed yet magnetic creatures.\"\n\nMarc Bekoff: Why did you write Slither?\n\nStephen Hall: I’ve always been fascinated by the beauty, agility, latent menace, and sheer Otherness of snakes. As a kid, I had a few snakes as pets, but it was never an obsession. As a science writer, though, I began to notice some really fascinating research articles on snakes in prominent journals like Science and Nature over the last decade or so: how they move, how they digest infrequent meals, how they sense their world. And I realized that some of the most remarkable traits of these animals were microscopic, molecular, indeed invisible to us for centuries. Given the undisputed fact that many people loathe and detest snakes, I thought it would be an interesting challenge to try to reconcile this hatred with the need to respect and preserve a class of animal that is routinely killed and in some cases faces extinction due to habitat destruction.\n\nMB: How does your book relate to your background and general areas of interest?\n\nSH: In all my books, I try to find narratives that show how new research technologies change our perception of biology in particular and of nature in general. In snakes, radio telemetry in the 1990s allowed researchers to track individual snakes in the wild, which allowed them to see unexpected behaviors: maternal care, sociality, temperament, habit, idiosyncrasy. Many researchers told me snakes have distinct personalities. Some rattlesnakes hang out with their “friends,” for example, and avoid other snakes they apparently don’t like. Rattlesnake moms sometimes use “babysitters” to look after their newborns while they go off to eat (gestating females may go nearly a year without eating).\n\nWith the advent of advanced genetics and genomics, snake scientists have also unearthed some mind-boggling metabolic tricks. Burmese pythons sometimes eat only one big meal a year: They may be the original intermittent fasters! And the meals are huge, equivalent to a roughly 140-pound human eating a 220-pound hamburger in one gulp. How do they process these huge meals? Snake scientists have discovered that almost from the instant they ingest food, these snakes turn on something like 2000 genes. They can enlarge their hearts to pump the “sludge” of fat-saturated blood. They enlarge the intestines to process all that food. And when digestion is complete, they molecularly pare away the cells that enlarged the heart, gut, liver, and kidneys. In other words, they can regenerate their own tissues on demand, in a kind of controlled proliferation that resembles cancer, then eliminate the cells, reverting to a metabolic state so low that it barely uses any energy to stay alive.2\n\nMB: What are some of the topics you consider and what are some of your major messages?\n\nSH: One of the major messages is that we can learn a surprising amount about human biology if we conduct research on snakes. One fascinating area of research is in the reproductive sphere. Patricia Brennan, a scientist at Mt. Holyoke College, has quantified sexual antagonism between male and female snakes by making casts of their genitalia (yes, a serpentine twist on the 1970s plastercasters!). Male snakes have two penises (the technical name is hemipenes), and in some species, the male organ almost resembles a medieval weapon—barbs, spikes, and protrusions likened to grappling hooks. Yet in other species, there’s no hardware; I saw a cobra hemipenis in Brennan’s lab, more than a foot long, that had fluttering, petal-like protrusions, almost like a foxglove plant. Her research has shown how genital anatomy can reflect either sexual antagonism or compatibility within a species, and she believes studying the female response to these male appurtenances may have implications for human health.\n\nAnother rich area of interest is research on the origins of fear of snakes. There is a strain of psychological research that hypothesizes the existence of a “fear module” in primates, including humans, that is specifically oriented towards serpents. One of the most provocative recent ideas is the so-called “Snake Detection Theory” advanced by Lynne Isbell of the University of California-Davis, which argues that in the early evolutionary history of mammals and then primates, the swift detection of snakes, a lethal predator, conferred a survival advantage—so much so that in order to hasten detection, evolution created two neural pathways, one subconscious and slightly faster than the other, which are preserved in modern primate brains, including ours. So we may be hard-wired to notice snakes, and Isbell believes the development of this neural system resulted in the huge visual system that distinguishes primates, including humans, from many other species. Fear may be partially innate, or at least associated with detection, but it is also acquired through culture, religion, and family.3\n\nSource: Grand Central/with permission.\n\nMB: Are you hopeful that as people learn more about snakes they will treat them with more respect?\n\nSH: One of the things that surprised me in the course of the research for Slither is how much ancient cultures venerated snakes. It made me wonder: What did people in antiquity know that we don’t? Ancient cultures viewed snakes as intermediaries between humans and nature in all its manifestations. Serpents symbolized power and protection (to ancient Egyptians), health and healing (to ancient Greeks), agricultural fertility (to Mesoamerican cultures), and messengers to nature writ large in many cultures. These symbolic powers inspired reverence, and that reverence has been overtaken by fear and loathing in more recent times. If we respect them more (and protect their habitats), we might learn more about their unique biology and amazing physical capabilities in ways that might enhance human health.\n\nAnd their metaphoric and symbolic power is profound. Like the sudden strike of a venomous serpent, snakes remind us of the unpredictability and fragility of life; in an age when algorithms and AI lure us into thinking that everything can be predicted, unpredictability may ultimately be more terrifying to us than any snake.\n\nFacebook image: Rupankar Bhattacharjee/Shutterstock"}
