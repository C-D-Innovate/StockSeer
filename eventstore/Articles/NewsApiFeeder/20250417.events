As it turns out, the term is nonsensical.\n\nIt sounds technical—maybe even credible—but it’s complete nonsense. And yet, it’s turning up in scientific papers, AI responses, and even peer-reviewed journals. So… how did this phantom phrase become part of our collective knowledge?\n\nAs painstakingly reported by Retraction Watch in February, the term may have been pulled from parallel columns of text in a 1959 paper on bacterial cell walls. The AI seemed to have jumped the columns, reading two unrelated lines of text as one contiguous sentence, according to one investigator.\n\nThe farkakte text is a textbook case of what researchers call a digital fossil: An error that gets preserved in the layers of AI training data and pops up unexpectedly in future outputs. The digital fossils are “nearly impossible to remove from our knowledge repositories,” according to a team of AI researchers who traced the curious case of “vegetative electron microscopy,” as noted in The Conversation.\n\nThe fossilization process started with a simple mistake, as the team reported. Back in the 1950s, two papers were published in Bacteriological Reviews that were later scanned and digitized.\n\nThe layout of the columns as they appeared in those articles confused the digitization software, which mashed up the word “vegetative” from one column with “electron” from another. The fusion is a so-called “tortured phrase”—one that is hidden to the naked eye, but apparent to software and language models that “read” text.\n\nAs chronicled by Retraction Watch, nearly 70 years after the biology papers were published, “vegetative electron microscopy” started popping up in research papers out of Iran.\n\nThere, a Farsi translation glitch may have helped reintroduce the term: the words for “vegetative” and “scanning” differ by just a dot in Persian script—and scanning electron microscopy is a very real thing. That may be all it took for the false terminology to slip back into the scientific record.\n\nBut even if the error began with a human translation, AI replicated it across the web, according to the team who described their findings in The Conversation. The researchers prompted AI models with excerpts of the original papers, and indeed, the AI models reliably completed phrases with the BS term, rather than scientifically valid ones. Older models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-2 and BERT, did not produce the error, giving the researchers an indication of when the contamination of the models’ training data occurred.\n\n“We also found the error persists in later models including GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5,” the group wrote in its post. “This suggests the nonsense term may now be permanently embedded in AI knowledge bases.”\n\nThe group identified the CommonCrawl dataset—a gargantuan repository of scraped internet pages—as the likely source of the unfortunate term that was ultimately picked up by AI models. But as tricky as it was to find the source of the errors, eliminating them is even harder. CommonCrawl consists of petabytes of data, which makes it tough for researchers outside of the largest tech companies to address issues at scale. That’s besides the fact that leading AI companies are famously resistant to sharing their training data.\n\nBut AI companies are only part of the problem—journal-hungry publishers are another beast. As reported by Retraction Watch, the publishing giant Elsevier tried to justify the sensibility of “vegetative electron microscopy” before ultimately issuing a correction.\n\nThe journal Frontiers had its own debacle last year, when it was forced to retract an article that included nonsensical AI-generated images of rat genitals and biological pathways. Earlier this year, a team of researchers in Harvard Kennedy School’s Misinformation Review highlighted the worsening issue of so-called “junk science” on Google Scholar, essentially unscientific bycatch that gets trawled up by the engine.\n\nAI has genuine use cases across the sciences, but its unwieldy deployment at scale is rife with the hazards of misinformation, both for researchers and for the scientifically inclined public. Once the erroneous relics of digitization become embedded in the internet’s fossil record, recent research indicates they’re pretty darn difficult to tamp down."}

Starting with English and French, the foundation will offer stripped down versions of raw Wikipedia text, excluding any references or markdown code.\n\nBeing a non-profit, volunteer-led platform, Wikipedia monetizes largely through donations and does not own the content it hosts, allowing anyone to use and remix content from the platform. It is fine with other organizations using its vast corpus of knowledge for all sorts of cases—Kiwix, for example, is an offline version of Wikipedia that has been used to smuggle information into North Korea.\n\nBut a flood of bots constantly trawling its website for AI training needs has led to a surge in non-human traffic to Wikipedia, something it was interested in addressing as the costs soared. Earlier this month, the foundation said bandwidth consumption has increased 50% since January 2024. Offering a standard, JSON-formatted version of Wikipedia articles should dissuade AI developers from bombarding the website.\n\n“As the place the machine learning community comes for tools and tests, Kaggle is extremely excited to be the host for the Wikimedia Foundation’s data,” Kaggle partnerships lead Brenda Flynn told The Verge. “Kaggle is excited to play a role in keeping this data accessible, available, and useful.”\n\nIt is no secret that tech companies fundamentally do not respect content creators and place little value on any individual’s creative work. There is a rising school of thought in the industry that all content should be free and that taking it from anywhere on the web to train an AI model constitutes fair use due to the transformative nature of language models.\n\nBut someone has to create the content in the first place, which is not cheap, and AI startups have been all too willing to ignore previously accepted norms around respecting a site’s wishes not to be crawled. Language models that produce human-like text outputs need to be trained on vast amounts of material, and training data has become something akin to oil in the AI boom. It is well known that the leading models are trained using copyrighted works, and several AI companies remain in litigation over the issue. The threat to companies from Chegg to Stack Overflow is that AI companies will ingest their content and return to it users without sending traffic to the companies that made the content in the first place.\n\nSome contributors to Wikipedia may dislike their content being made available for AI training, for these reasons and others. All writing on the website is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, which allows anyone to freely share, adapt, and build upon a work, even commercially, as long as they credit the original creator and license their derivative works under the same terms.\n\nThe dataset through Kaggle is available for any developer to use for free. The Wikimedia Foundation told Gizmodo that Kaggle is accessing Wikipedia’s dataset through a “Structured Content” beta program within the Wikipedia Enterprise suite, a premium offering that allows high-volume users to more easily reuse content. It said that reusers of the content, such as AI model companies, are still expected to respect Wikipedia’s attribution and licensing terms."}

The Hi-Tech, “Ultra-Efficient”, Dystopian Future of International Travel", "fullContent": "“E-gates of this type open the possibility of harvesting the travel data and biometrics of the population across our lifetimes.”\n\nThe past week has seen a spate of articles in the UK on how biometric technologies are about to revolutionise international travel, making it a far more efficient, painless experience. Unsurprisingly, far more column space has been given over to the potential pros than the cons of implementing biometric technologies, particularly facial recognition, at more or less every step of the air travel experience.\n\nFirst out of the blocks was The Times, a Murdoch-owned outlet, with a piece titled “New Airport Rules Will Get Rid of Boarding Passes and Check-in“.* The article explains how the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a global standards-setting UN body, is tearing up existing rules for airports and airlines and creating a new “digital travel credential”, allowing (but not yet mandating) passport information stored on devices to be used for travel:\n\nBoarding passes and the need to check-in for flights will be scrapped as part of plans to overhaul the aviation industry in the biggest shake-up in 50 years. Passengers will be able to upload their passports to their phone and pass through airports using only their face for verification within “two to three years”… Checking in for flights online or at the airport will become obsolete. Instead passengers will be able to download a “journey pass” to their phone when they book a flight. It will be automatically updated if any changes are made to the booking. With no check-in, airlines will be alerted to a passenger’s intention to fly when they arrive at the airport and their face is scanned.\n\nOther British newspapers uncritically amplified the story. Here’s the Independent’s travel correspondent, Simon Galder, shamelessly gushing at the prospect of smiling one’s way through the airport. Your face, he says, “will be your fortune”:\n\nAirport revolution: how facial biometrics and better tech will remove (some of) the pain of going through an airport.\n\nNo more \"book then check-in later\": a journey pass as soon as you buy.\n\nSmile your way through the airport: your face will be your fortune.https://t.co/qxNhXvwbPw — Simon Calder (@SimonCalder) April 12, 2025\n\nJudging by the comments below the tweet, other travellers are somewhat less enthused at the prospect .\n\n“No thank you, this is sinister,” tweeted Helen.\n\nOthers asked what would happen if their mobile phone stopped working, the battery ran out or there was an IT outage affecting the airport’s IT systems.\n\nIndy Singh, a software engineer tweeted that he hoped the new systems “work for non-white people,” adding that none of the e-gates I use at airports work for me.”\n\nThis is a common complaint about facial recognition systems: they are biased, mainly because the training data on which they are based can include biased human decisions or reflect historical or social inequities. A 2018 study titled “Gender Shades” by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru, published by MIT Media Lab, reported an error rate for light-skinned men of 0.8%, compared to 34.7% for darker-skinned women.\n\nA 2019 test by the federal government concluded the technology works best on middle-age white men. Between 2015 and 2018 Amazon tried to eradicate gender bias in its AI-based hiring practices, but couldn’t and ended up having to give up. If Amazon can’t eliminate bias in its AI programming, who can?\n\nWhile the accuracy of facial recognition systems may have improved significantly since then, they are still riddled with biases. As a Washington Post investigation revealed in January, this hasn’t stopped law enforcement agencies across the US from using flawed AI facial recognition systems to wrongfully arrest and jail Americans. In many cases, investigating officers did not bother to gather basic information like alibis and ignored contradictory evidence, even DNA and fingerprints that pointed to other suspects.\n\nMaking Smartphones a Mandatory Travel Accessory\n\nOne of the companies developing the biometric systems for airports is Amadeus IT Group, a large Spanish multinational IT company that provides software for the global travel and tourism industry. The company told The Times that travellers will be able to download a “journey pass” to their mobile phone, along with a digital version of their passport, to enable each touchpoint to be handled with biometrics instead of physical ID documents and credentials.\n\nIn other words, if the system eventually becomes mandatory, which is presumably the ultimate goal, you will need a smartphone to cross international borders. According to the Times article, this system could be fully operational within just three years — in other words, just before 2030:\n\n“These changes are the biggest in 50 years,” said Valérie Viale, director of product management at Amadeus, the world’s largest travel technology company. “Many airline systems haven’t changed for more than 50 years because everything has to be consistent across the industry and interoperable. “The last upgrade of great scale was the adoption of e-ticketing in the early 2000s. The industry has now decided it’s time to upgrade to modern systems that are more like what Amazon would use.”\n\nThat is perhaps not as comforting as Viale presumably intended. The idea of the airports of the future being based around Amazon’s approach to business and customer service implies there will be generally (but not always) high levels of logistical efficiency, all made possible by a blithe disregard for basic standards of human morality and decency.\n\nThe ICAO is not the only global standards setter pushing for paperless travel. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently announced the launch of its Contactless Travel Directory, which is designed to significantly accelerate the global adoption of biometric travel solutions by streamlining the ability of airlines to integrate and expand biometric services at airports.\n\nThe End of Paper Passports?\n\nTraditional paper-based travel documents like passports and boarding passes will gradually become obsolete. At least that is the plan. International Airport Review:\n\nAccording to the IATA official website, the directory will offer an efficient matchmaking platform, allowing airlines to quickly identify available biometric travel points at specific airports and coordinate these solutions with their partner carriers. The goal is to create a seamless, paperless journey for passengers through critical checkpoints, including baggage drop, security checks, lounge access, and boarding.\n\nIn February, the European Union’s Tourism platform posted a report on the EU’s latest plans to launch the Entry/Exit System (EES), “replacing traditional passport stamping with a biometric-based system that records fingerprints and facial scans at external Schengen borders” (emphasis my own):\n\nThe Entry/Exit System is a fully automated border control mechanism that registers and tracks non-EU citizens entering and exiting the Schengen Zone. Unlike the traditional manual passport stamping, EES will: Collect biometric data (fingerprints and facial recognition scans) at border checkpoints.\n\nRecord entry and exit dates electronically, eliminating reliance on passport stamps.\n\nMonitor the duration of stay for non-EU visitors to prevent overstays… While the shift to biometric border control may pose initial challenges, it represents a long-term move towards digitalisation and security in the European travel landscape. Frequent travellers should stay updated on border policies to avoid unnecessary delays and ensure a seamless entry into the Schengen Zone. As the EU moves forward with its digital transformation of travel, one thing is clear: the era of paper passports and manual stamping is rapidly coming to an end.\n\nThe EU may well be jumping the gun here. After all, its Exit-Entry system dates back to 2016 and has been repeatedly delayed. It was initially scheduled for implementation in 2022, then May 2023, then late 2023, and then late 2024, when it was postponed again for unexplained reasons. The latest deadline has been set for October 2025. While there can be no doubt that the system will eventually be launched, it remains to be seen how reliable it will be once it is up and running.\n\nIn the US, meanwhile, biometric systems are also being rolled out at a blistering pace. Currently, there are 93 airports in the country that use Credential Authentication Technology (CAT-2) units that feature facial recognition technology, according to the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nAs the country prepares to host a series of major global events, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games, a report by the “Commission on Seamless and Secure Travel” (CSST) has called for significant reforms to modernise the nation’s travel infrastructure, including “increased reliance on biometrics, artificial intelligence, and advanced data analytics in travel screening.”\n\nAccording to an article in International Airport Review, 98% of airlines globally have either implemented or are planning to implement biometric systems at their airport terminals. Sixty percent are incorporate biometrics into essential passenger touchpoints such as check-in, bag-drop, lounge access and boarding within the next five years.\n\n“The End of Anonymity As We Know It”\n\nIt is not hard to see why this is happening.\n\nBiometric identity systems offer the promise of faster passenger processing — which will appeal to most, if not all, travellers, especially frequent business passengers — as well as greater security by rapidly identifying threats. For airline and logistics businesses, they offer the promise of drastically lower operating costs by reducing the need for human workers. For governments, they offer the promise of much greater, more granular control over their increasingly restive populations.\n\nHowever, they also raise significant privacy, civil liberties and security concerns, including “the end of anonymity as we know it”, warns the ACLU:\n\nAs law enforcement authorities continue to add to the network of cameras monitoring our public spaces, it will become increasingly difficult to evade their watchful eye and, soon enough, their automated biometric identification. The biometric threat is not limited to government; corporations are joining the fray, too. Popular social media sites have been building and testing facial recognition databases for years. There is little public explanation of the ways in which those biometric datasets are being used, aggregated, and potentially sold.\n\nIt is not for nothing that more than a dozen large US cities have banned the technology, including Minneapolis, Boston, and San Francisco.\n\nHowever, despite its many flaws and the threats it poses to basic democratic rights and freedoms, the lure of biometrics is hard for governments, law enforcement agencies and private companies to resist. Last year the Washington Post reported that law enforcement agencies in some of the cities where its use was banned were asking neighbouring forces to search face databases for them.\n\nIn the UK, the use of facial recognition technologies by police forces and private companies, including high street retailers, has ballooned in recent years, regardless of which party is in government. And it has given rise to a huge new industry that is harvesting — and in some cases, storing — vast volumes of data about us, warns the civil liberties group Big Brother Watch:\n\n[B]ehind these apparently convenient e-gates is a completely new, colossal infrastructure harvesting our digital information. Rather than showing a paper passport to a human officer like we all used to, the officer is now a machine and it already has your passport, your photos, your biometric data and potentially more of your information in a giant database. The emergence of “smart” borders is not simply a technological upgrade – it is a shift for our privacy rights. How intrusive this will be depends on how much data the Government decides to store and for how long. But in theory, e-gates of this type open the possibility of harvesting the travel data and biometrics of the population across our lifetimes, as well as detailed records of the tens of millions of visitors to the UK each year… How intrusive it will be also depends on whether we can choose to use e-gates. Currently, we can choose whether to use passport e-gates, and they require us to present our passport. But the difference with “frictionless” security is that the individual has less agency – your passport is effectively digitally pickpocketed by high-tech cameras that scan your face and decide whether to permit or deny your entry. Unless it is radically changed, the Government’s Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, currently going through parliament, will significantly weaken our data rights, paving the way for a country with many more facial recognition cameras not only in airports but potentially everywhere.\n\nA key feature of biometric identifiers often gets overlooked in the often one-sided debate on biometric surveillance technologies: their irreplaceable nature. If biometric data is hacked, there is no way of undoing the damage. You cannot change or cancel your iris, fingerprint, or DNA, like you can change a password or cancel your credit card.\n\nThe biggest irony about this mad rush to streamline airport efficiencies by using flawed biometric technologies is that it comes less than a year after the Crowdstrike outage brought air travel to a virtual standstill. As WIRED reported in its aftermath, automation is critical to the airlines industry, but for the automated systems to work, they require functioning computers.\n\nWhen those computers go down at a given airport, the effects can cascade, and delays pile up. But when they go down at hubs, the entire aviation system gets throttled. This happens even if the technologies used to fly and direct planes while in the air are unaffected. For example: The US Federal Aviation Administration posted on X on Friday morning that it was “not impacted by the global IT issue.”\n\nSo, not only does the mass rollout of biometric ID systems across the international travel infrastructure threaten to establish a dangerous precedent for far broader government surveillance, based on flawed technologies; it will also make the aviation industry even more dependent on automation, and thereby even more exposed to IT outages, cyberattacks and data breaches — precisely at a time when IT outages, cyberattacks and data breaches are on the rise.\n\nIf the Crowdstrike taught us anything, it is that paper-based systems such as passports and cash have one major advantage over IT-based systems: they don’t crash. Unfortunately, it is a lesson that few in government and the corporate world apparently seem willing to heed.\n\n* For a number of months now, the Murdoch-owned Times has been regularly churning out puff pieces calling for the rollout of digital identity, facial recognition and other biometric technologies in order to address myriad societal ills, including the scourge of “populism”. A couple of examples:\n\nTony Blair: \"Introduce mandatory digital IDs and facial recognition because…populism!

Here’s Blair’s latest pitch for digital ID and live facial recognition:\n\nThe Tony Blair Institute has released another video pushing for digital IDs and live facial recognition — all under the guise of border security, protecting public services, and creating a ‘fairer’ justice system. We must not allow this to happen.pic.twitter.com/lvFf1CChGH — Lewis Brackpool (@Lewis_Brackpool) April 15, 2025\n\nCoincidentally, the first proposal on the Times Crime and Justice Commission’s ten-point plan for crime and justice is to “introduce a universal digital ID system to drive down fraud, tackle illegal immigration and reduce identity theft.”\n\nAs we reported in January, the propaganda push for the government’s proposed digital identity system is kicking into gear. Now that the IT systems have been developed, launched and is now supposedly ready for mass rollout, we are at the manufacturing consent stage of this long, drawn-out process.\n\nThe UK media is doing a top-notch job of selling digital identity to the public by over-selling the potential benefits while downplaying or completely ignoring the risks (unfettered mass surveillance, loss of privacy, widespread exclusion from welfare payments and public services, a gateway to central bank digital currencies…).\n\nHowever, the government’s One Login digital identity systems appears to be far from ready for mass rollout. According to an article published this week by Computer Weekly, citing an unnamed whistle-blower, many of the system’s “serious data protection failings” and “significant IT security shortcomings” that had been flagged in 2022 have still not been resolved.\n\nThe IT security shortcomings could increase the risk of data breaches. According to the whistle-blower, the information security of the three million current users of One Login remains at risk. The article also reveals that the development work on One Login has been offshored to Romania, apparently “without the knowledge or approval of the [Government Digital Service’s chief executive Tom Read] and without first seeking advice from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).”\n\nAll in all, not exactly confidence inspiring."}

This follows up on my previous article which you can find in my blog here on Lichess or in the link for the original article: X-Ray Attacks: Hidden Pressure, Sudden Impact. If you haven’t seen that one yet be sure to check it out, as it introduces the theme and covers attacking patterns and puzzles involving the X-ray motif.\n\nWhile in the first article we explored the offensive potential of the X-ray, in this lesson we flip the board and explore X-rays as a defensive motif. This is far less charted but equally important to grasp. As we defined in the previous lesson, X-rays involve a piece eyeing a square through the body of another piece. Even though the contact in indirect, the influence is still exerted within the line of sight of our piece. We’ve seen how is utilised in attacking themes, but this can work to your favour defensively too! This is demonstrated by the below example:\n\nDefensive X-ray – Introductory Example:\n\nWe have to guard Black’s checkmate threat on g2. Rg1 is not available, but there is another defence:\n\nhttps://lichess.org/study/kWe6Ipj6/rRKXjK1f#0\n\nRb2 indirectly defends g2 via an X-ray through Blacks Qf2. White’s will survive Blacks attack and will win by material.\n\nIn general, defensive tactics and puzzles are underrepresented in chess literature and resources. Probably because brilliant attacks are more satisfying to execute and solve, and defence generally does not attract attention. But learning to spot defensive resources is just as important to our chess development. Every player will be attacked and learning how to survive will save many points.\n\nIn the following six examples of gradual difficulty, we’ll explore how an X-ray defence holds the position together when the position looked gloom otherwise. Just like in the introductory example, in each case the defender seems to be in trouble, but a hidden lifeline lurks if you can identify the X-ray motif. Hopefully these examples show that defensive puzzles are just as interesting as attacking ones!\n\nPosition 1: Black to move\n\nBlack is up a pawn but hadn’t castled and looks to be in a deadly pin. Is it all over or can you find the resource to save the position?\n\nhttps://lichess.org/study/kWe6Ipj6/8uPj5Ztl#0\n\nYes!, defensive moves can be pleasing too! Ba4 is the only move to save black, and it is via an X-ray defence of Nc6 through Whites Bishop. The key is to see that Ba4 has indirect contact with Nc6 which becomes direct contact as soon as Whites Bishop takes, and therefore Ba4 does in fact defend Nc6.\n\nPosition 2: Black to play\n\nNow Black seems to be in trouble on the back rank. Can Black save the Rook and thereby his King?\n\nhttps://lichess.org/study/kWe6Ipj6/bgNTDUOs#0\n\nBlack could not directly defend his rook but an X-ray defence by Qa8 through Whites Queen saves the day. Note the X-ray defence is mutual, as Re8 also defends Qa8 if White takes the Queen.\n\nThe move Qa8 is particularly difficult to spot as it is both X-ray and backwards move, both of which can be blind spots in our tactical visions. If you want more examples of these types of counterintuitive retreating moves, be sure to check out my previous lesson “Don’t forget about backward moves!“\n\nPosition 3: Black to play\n\nWhite has sacrificed a piece and is threatening a menacing checkmate on h7. Can it be defended at all?\n\nhttps://lichess.org/study/kWe6Ipj6/XG7pnvnV#0\n\nAgain the only move that holds Blacks position is an X-ray, unconventionally defending h7 via Bd3 through Whites Queen. White’s attack is over and this again shows the importance of indirect line of sight. The next example combines defence and counterattack:\n\nPosition 4: White to play\n\nBlack has White in check thinking it forces a Queen trade leading to a winning endgame. Do you have a resource in the position?\n\nhttps://lichess.org/study/kWe6Ipj6/KYPFvZ0L#0\n\nHopefully the not-so-obvious yet powerful move was not so difficult to find. If this was the case, well done! This is pattern recognition kicking in and your tactical radar gained another weapon to use in your games!\n\nFor the final 2 examples I have ramped up the difficulty. There will be more moves to calculate but your tactical visions should be strong and you know what to look for.\n\nPosition 5: White to play\n\nThis was from my very own game playing White against a 2100+. Black has gone all in with the not-so-subtle plan of Qf3-g2, even leaving their Bd6 to be taken. Can we take it or are we falling into Blacks plan if we do? Or should we look to guard f3 instead?\n\nhttps://lichess.org/study/kWe6Ipj6/swjFiKlb#0\n\nYet another incredible save, an X-ray defence of g2 via a8. This example shows that defensive ideas can even win us games if we spot them before our opponent, as it meant we could safely grab Blacks Bishop on d6 for a decisive material advantage. For the final example we again combine attack and defence (and precise calculation):\n\nPosition 6: Black to move\n\nIn this position White has just played the sneaky Nd3-e1, which temporarily guards against his own back rank and also threatens blacks by opening up the d-file for a Rd8 invasion (with check!). Any slow move by Black and White will probably take on f3 and Black will have no more attack.\n\nhttps://lichess.org/study/kWe6Ipj6/TOqcUiDp#0\n\nDid you spot the defensive idea Kh7 allowing the X-ray defence on h8 by Rc8 from afar and calculate the variation til the end? Well done! And also who said defensive tactics aren't fun? Did you enjoy the puzzles and how did you do on them? Let me know in the comments!\n\nSeeing through the X-ray - Final thoughts\n\nX-rays don’t only attack. They also appear defensively in ways you might not expect. A piece that seems out of play might contribute from surprising angles. Always consider a piece's line of sight, even if there are objects in the way. As we've seen, indirect contact can carry hidden influence, and it could result in a hidden tactic or lifeline.\n\nI encourage you to go through this lesson more than once and revisit part 1: X-Ray Attacks: Hidden Pressure, Sudden Impact as well. The more you expose yourself to the motif, the more likely it is you will find them in your own games. These ideas could save you win many games and save you just as many half points. I will also give you here some recommended lessons that build on similar tactical themes to the X-ray:\n\nThe Elegant Crosspin\n\nHidden Moves on Empty Squares\n\nI hope you enjoyed this article!

That’s why many use Microsoft Intune, a cloud-based solution that allows administrators to manage multiple devices and define policies for things like updates.\n\nHowever, a bug in Intune is causing devices to upgrade to Windows 11 despite the update being blocked. Microsoft confirms this in a post in the Microsoft 365 admin center (spotted by BleepingComputer). The problem has apparently existed since April 12, but it only affects organizational devices managed by Intune.\n\nWhat to do if you’re using Intune\n\nWith Microsoft Intune, system administrators who manage dozens or huundreds of computers for companies and organizations can determine which software updates are available for installation. That includes upgrades to new Windows versions.\n\nIt isn’t entirely clear why this error is causing Intune settings to be ignored, nor is it known how many systems are affected. However, Microsoft is working on a solution and, for now, the company recommends completely pausing Windows feature updates via Intune.\n\nWhat to do if you’ve been upgraded\n\nIf you’re managing devices with Intune and those devices were upgraded to Windows 11 despite a policy that should’ve blocked the update, you either have to bite the bullet and move forward with Windows 11 or manually roll back each system to Windows 10.\n\nMicrosoft doesn’t offer an automated solution to roll back from Windows 11 to Windows 10, and the manual process can be difficult and time-consuming. It mainly involves the creation of Windows 10 bootable device and performing a fresh installation. Learn more in our quick guide to downgrading Windows 11 to Windows 10."}

More from the series →\n\nThis week’s Media Briefing looks at how publishers including Financial Times, Immediate Media and Reuters adopting AI tools to augment their journalism.\n\n— Jessica Davies, senior media editor, Digiday\n\nAI-assisted newsrooms\n\nAI-assisted newsrooms are having a moment, again.\n\nOnce dismissed as error-prone novelties — or outright threats to newsroom jobs — publishers are now actively embracing AI-powered tools to support reporters in everything from transcription and translation to background research, SEO optimization, press release summarization, headline selection, and even article drafting. As news organizations face relentless pressure to do more with less, this quiet adoption marks a significant shift: AI isn’t replacing journalists (yet) — it’s quietly becoming their sidekick.\n\n“We really want to empower our journalists and make it that they own their future — that the future is not happening to them,” Reuters’ head of AI strategy Jane Barrett told Digiday. The news organization, which has rigorously trained its 26,000 global journalists in generative AI use, rolled out a suite of AI video production tools to its publisher and broadcaster clients this April, after months of testing them in its newsrooms.\n\nOver the last month Reuters, The Independent, the Washington Post, and Newsquest have made noise about how they’re further adjusting their strategies to evolve with the rise of generative AI in a competitive news environment. Efforts include the addition of AI-assisted reporters in their newsrooms, updates to AI-powered content management systems, new proprietary AI tools, and entirely AI-produced news products like The Independent’s Bulletin.\n\nIt’s one thing for publishers to experiment with AI tools in small newsroom trials, but scaling them across entire editorial operations is a much bigger lift — requiring new workflows, staff training and cultural shifts. Still, that leap is increasingly happening as publishers chase efficiency and personalization with an eye to future-proofing their journalism, according to seven publishers Digiday spoke to for this article.\n\nThe Financial Times is using computational techniques to identify critical stories that might otherwise go untold. Last week it used AI to categorize 10,800 complaints from Tesla customers which resulted in its reporters writing a story on how Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency mass firings disproportionately hit staff assessing self-driving risks. It used that same technique for the first time last year when it analyzed 36,000 images using a machine-learning image recognition tool to find missing Ukrainian children on Russian adoption sites.\n\nLike The Independent’s Bulletin service, the FT is also using AI to help create secondary content: short summaries of articles that are reviewed by editors before publication. It plans to automate this test and extend it to around 5% of articles, then monitor the effect on reader engagement.\n\n\n\n“We won’t allow AI to compromise the integrity of our journalism, which will be reported, written and created by our journalists, but our newsroom is also innovating and experimenting,” said Matthew Garrahan, the FT’s head of digital platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, agentic AI — though still nascent and more popular as a talking point among ad agencies and ad tech vendors — is gaining more traction among publishers with some experimenting with use cases, and others having already assimilated agentic AI into their workflows as an efficiency tool.\n\nFor now, publisher attention has focused largely on efficiency and productivity gains, but that’s changing to embrace how reporters can unlock new ways to do investigative journalism, according to Joanna Levesque, managing director of the FT’s consulting arm FT Strategies. “I do think there is a maturity across publishers coming,” she said.\n\nThe thinking is that publishers can’t afford to keep AI at arm’s distance. Referral traffic has long been a volatile source of audience for publishers — but the rise of AI platforms and answer engines, which increasingly serve up content without prompting users to click through, threatens to make that problem even worse.\n\n“In this new AI world, the distribution channels are changing, just as they did with social media, and so we need to be really thinking about, how we have our news ready to get into these new distribution channels and to find new audiences and prove that value of the usefulness and the relevance of fact-based unbiased news,” said Barrett.\n\nHanding off the grunt work to AI – the productivity promise for publishers\n\nThe conversation is shifting from fears that AI will replace journalists to a more measured acceptance that it will reshape editorial roles — ideally freeing reporters to focus on deeper investigative work. That kind of high-value journalism is becoming even more critical as publishers try to create content compelling enough to drive clicks from AI answer engines, which, unlike traditional search, aren’t built to encourage that behavior.\n\nReuters journalists transcribed almost 7,000 minutes of content in 70 languages last month across the newsroom using its AI video tool, saving dozens of hours of work, according to a Reuters spokesperson.\n\n“It’s empowering our journalists to work faster, not to have to be working horrible late nights because something suddenly happens in your language,” said Barrett.\n\nUse of the generative AI tools has helped lower the stress levels in the Reuters newsroom, Barrett said. She admitted that the role of junior reporters now is markedly different from a few years ago, but that it’s not hindering their development, just reshaping the requirements for those roles. “There are some jobs that will change,” conceded Barrett, “but we’re committed to helping people through that change, and we’re also committed to reinvesting in news gathering because that’s what AI can’t do — it can’t be human.”\n\nFor others though, there will likely be cuts. One publisher executive who agreed to speak anonymously said they’re expecting to reduce headcount by a few people a year as a result of efficiency gains on AI tools. Although, that same exec said this isn’t an overall concern for its journalism with reporters freed up to spend more time on investigative journalism.\n\nBarrett claims that AI is taking on the grunt work of many roles, which traditionally have involved mining and filtering thousands of press releases a day and similar volumes of video footage, to find the right facts and source material for bulletins, summaries, follow-up stories and video content.\n\n“I know from personal experience that sitting there at 7 a.m. when all the company news starts flooding out at you is really stressful, like super high adrenaline,” said Barrett.\n\nReuters rolled out its first set of generative AI tools last April, and unveiled a new batch of video AI tools two weeks ago to its publishers and broadcaster clients. The tools are designed to shave time off video production workflows. Barrett is bullish on never using AI for image generation.\n\nThe AI assistant within the Reuters CMS is a chatGPT plugin, where editorial staff can ask it questions like how to shorten an article if it’s too long or whether any fresh angles have been missed in the story, or check the angle is timely enough.\n\nWhile there is a marked change in how much publishers are investing in AI in their own staff and product output, the journey will unlikely be smooth for a while. Bloomberg reportedly had a rocky start with its AI summaries, having to redact certain ones based on details about Trump tariffs that the AI got wrong, like incorrect figures and incorrect attribution.\n\nBut if anything, this kind of snafu simply serves to underline the united front publishers have: that AI can be valuable in assisting but never replacing human journalists.\n\nImmediate Media, home to magazine titles including Good Food and Top Gear, has developed a “first draft” tool for its writers that connects GPT with the publisher’s content archives to help create first drafts of articles, which are then rigorously checked by its journalists. This isn’t intended to speed up the volume of articles it can create, but means writers can now have the AI mine the millions of articles created by the magazine brands and do things that would have been previously highly time-intensive like establishing a skeleton timeline or ensure angles are new, across titles including Godo Food, according to director of digital content strategy at Immediate Media Roxanne Fisher.\n\nThose surfaced articles can then be contextually fed into new articles. “This gives you a first draft and can save you 20% to 30% of your time in content creation,” said Fisher. “I don’t want to read an email that’s written in AI, and users don’t want to read a piece of content that’s obviously written by AI,” she added.\n\nNaturally, there is still reason to proceed cautiously. But after years of skepticism, newsrooms are no longer just dabbling with AI — they’re defining how it fits into their workflows. “We don’t want AI to be creating our content. We want it to be assisting in the content creation. Yes, it’s short-cutting that research process and that kind of frameworking and first drafting, but it won’t take away from the job that the editor and editorial team do,” added Fisher.\n\nWhat we’ve heard\n\n“What’s their [publishers with AI licensing deals] thinking around selling their soul for lunch money? The ones we see like $30 million, $75 million — it still doesn’t sound like much to me if you’re looking at potentially a new method of consumer interaction where nothing happens anymore on your own and operated domain. If that’s the compensation you get, that’s still lunch money.”\n\n— An anonymous publishing executive on publisher licensing deals with AI platforms.\n\nNumbers to know\n\n-33.1%: How much WARC forecasts that news publishers’ ad revenue will drop this year compared to 2019.\n\n$9 billion: The figure Netflix expects to hit in global advertising sales by 2023.\n\n65: People working on People’s new TikTok-like app full time.\n\nWhat we’ve covered\n\nContent creators rethink their revenue mix amid recession fears\n\nContent creators are adjusting their monetization strategies to rely less on individual fans and more on advertisers, in anticipation of the expected recession.\n\nKick’s co-founder Ed Craven talks creator push and growing pains\n\nStreaming platform Kick is on a creator charm offensive as it looks to bump up its usage and compete with Twitch.

Then came a few curveballs. After letting Monday's WNBA draft sink in, what continues to stand out?\n\nFive overseas players who didn't compete in college in the United States were selected, including three in the first round. That trio -- the Seattle Storm's Dominique Malonga (France) at No. 2, Golden State Valkyries' Justė Jocytė (Lithuania) at No. 5 and Chicago Sky's Ajša Sivka (Slovenia) at No. 10 -- all were born in November 2005 and will be 19 during this WNBA season. They are the equivalent of college freshmen or sophomores in age, but their professional experience appealed to these WNBA teams.\n\nThe SEC led all conferences with 10 players drafted. The Big Ten had seven, the ACC six and the Big 12 five. But center Sedona Prince of Big 12 champion TCU wasn't selected.\n\nBeing drafted -- even in the first round -- is no guarantee of making a team, even with more jobs available now as expansion team Golden State prepares for its inaugural season. That's especially the case for teams that had the most picks: the Dallas Wings and Washington Mystics with five each. It might benefit some draftees to be cut sooner than later, so they get a chance with another team. Rookies have to make an impression in camp to secure a spot before the season starts May 16.\n\nHere are takeaways from the 2025 draft and how it will impact this WNBA season.\n\nplay 0:40 Juste Jocyte selected No. 5 with Valkyries' first-ever draft pick The Golden State Valkyries take Juste Jocyte from Lithuania with the franchise's first WNBA draft pick.\n\nThe Valkyries scored our worst draft grade Monday (C-minus), this after an underwhelming expansion draft and free agency. What are your expectations for Golden State this season?\n\nMichael Voepel: Every year, I vacillate on grades: Too harsh? Too soft? With Golden State, Jocytė could end up becoming a WNBA star and our draft grade could ultimately get an F. But for now she's less of a known quantity to WNBA fans than some of the college players Golden State might have selected.\n\nThe Valkyries' roster construction thus far indicates they are looking for specific skill sets and then will figure out how to mesh them together. That's how it generally goes for expansion teams. It's doubtful anyone externally has expectations of much success for the Valkyries this season as they try to get established and work on being an appealing free agent destination starting in 2026.\n\nKendra Andrews: Valkyries owner Joe Lacob set the same expectations for his WNBA team that he did when he purchased his NBA team over 10 years ago: win a championship in the first few years. So let's give the Valkyries a few years to get up and running. It's impossible for them to pinpoint holes they need to fill or chemistry adjustments they need to make; they don't yet know how their group will look on the court. General manager Ohemaa Nyanin is stressing the importance of training camp for piecing her team together.\n\nKevin Pelton: The expectation should be to have the best odds of winning the 2026 draft lottery. The WNBA did the Valkyries no favor by giving them the fifth pick, after all four of last year's non-playoff teams. The last time the league expanded, the Atlanta Dream got the fourth pick out of what was then 14 teams, ahead of two teams in the lottery. With the 2026 draft looking deeper than this year's group after Lauren Betts, Flau'jae Johnson and Olivia Miles decided to return to college, Golden State should be able to add a bigger star next April.\n\nDo you envision Sedona Prince, who wasn't drafted Monday, ending up in the WNBA? Will she be invited to a training camp? What might be next for her basketball career?\n\nVoepel: Prince's age (she turns 25 just before this season starts), lengthy time in college (she first enrolled in 2018) and injury history are concerns. But WNBA teams' biggest issue regarding Prince are allegations of sexual assault and intimate partner violence, which Prince has denied and for which she has not been charged. However, she could still be invited to a camp. Prince is 6-foot-7 and in her two seasons at TCU averaged 18.1 points, 9.5 rebounds and 3.0 blocks while shooting 57.1% from the field. We will see whether any WNBA team believes in her talent and is willing to sign her. If not, she will have to look to play overseas and then possibly get a chance in the WNBA.\n\nPlay Fantasy Women's Basketball Fantasy Women's Basketball is now open! Create or join a league today to get started. • Sign up for free!\n\nKatie Barnes: Prince not being selected in the WNBA draft on Monday was one of the most surprising things to happen that night. She could be invited to training camp by any WNBA team, but I am dubious that an invite will be extended. The fact that she wasn't drafted created additional coverage and social media attention; it seems doubtful that a team is willing to absorb that. Prince removed her draft announcement from her Instagram, which underscores the doubt about her future. She could go overseas to play professionally in an effort to show WNBA GMs that her on-court value is worth consideration. I would be surprised if she is in the WNBA this season.\n\nplay 1:17 Seattle Storm select Dominique Malonga 2nd overall The Seattle Storm select Dominique Malonga from France with the second pick of the WNBA draft.\n\nWhat was your favorite pick Monday?\n\nJonathan Givony: I went to watch Malonga work out in New York on Tuesday morning. While I'm far from an expert on women's basketball, I have covered a lot of basketball workouts in 20-plus years and have seen a lot of really talented players up close.\n\nI was blown away by what I saw from Malonga. First, with her physical profile: the size, wingspan, huge hands and frame that can carry weight. She moves so fluidly, gets off her feet so easily for dunks and has legitimate skill on the perimeter with her ballhandling and perimeter shooting. She was shooting from the NBA 3-point line, which isn't quite her range yet, but Malonga has great mechanics, touch and ability to get her jumper off on the move.\n\nThat's really intriguing at 19 years old with all the things she can already do on the defensive end with her physical tools. She told me she originally planned on going to Harvard until an opportunity in France came up that she couldn't turn down. She said she'll be in Seattle in the next 2-3 weeks, once her season ends.\n\nIt's going to be exciting to follow her progress. Everyone says she's the next Victor Wembanyama; she actually reminded me a little bit of the first time I went to see Giannis Antetokounmpo back when he was in Greece.\n\nWent to watch Dominique Malonga -- the No. 2 pick in the WNBA Draft -- work out in NYC. Blown away by how talented she is. 6'6, 7'1 wingspan, huge hands. Dunks with ease. Makes NBA-range pullup 3s effortlessly. Only 19 years old. The Seattle Storm got a good one. pic.twitter.com/boLNV49uQ1 — Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) April 15, 2025\n\nVoepel: LSU's Aneesah Morrow at No. 7 to Connecticut. History could repeat itself: LSU's Angel Reese went seventh last year to Chicago and had a historic rookie season with double-doubles and as a rebounder. The Sun are reestablishing their identity after losing Alyssa Thomas, DeWanna Bonner and Brionna Jones. Morrow (and No. 8 pick Saniya Rivers) can be a big part of that.\n\nAndrews: I like the addition of Aziaha James to the Wings. Paige Bueckers will make more of the headlines for Dallas, but in James the Wings are getting a player who can explode offensively at any moment. She can give the team some much-needed production off the bench and help the franchise build a more complete team that could make a push back into the playoffs.\n\nplay 0:48 Te-Hina Paopao is ready to bring Samoan culture to Atlanta New Atlanta Dream star Te-Hina Paopao talks about bringing her Samoan heritage to the WNBA.\n\nPelton: The Atlanta Dream taking South Carolina's Te-Hina Paopao with the 18th pick. Holly Winterburn being ruled out for 2025 because of injury left the Dream with a void behind Jordin Canada at point guard, which Paopao could fill. New Atlanta coach Karl Smesko is going to want shooting on the perimeter, and Paopao fits the bill as a career 40% 3-point shooter who led Division I at 47% in 2023-24.\n\nBarnes: Hailey Van Lith going to Chicago got me excited. Seeing Van Lith play in this year's NCAA tournament for TCU after spending so much time around LSU last season showed me how much of a contrast there was between those experiences for her. Chicago offers an opportunity with little pressure. There's a familiar face in Reese -- who shared her own excitement on social media -- and the opportunity to learn from Courtney Vandersloot. Plus, new coach Tyler Marsh is known for player development. It's a great fit for Van Lith and gives her an opportunity to reach her ceiling as a pro.\n\nWhich pick left you scratching your head?\n\nAndrews: I was surprised Golden State opted to draft three guards with all of its picks. The Valkyries still lack a dominant big inside, and there were some solid options in this draft class. An electrifying guard was one of their other needs, but adding only at that position leaves them with more needs heading into camp."}

Trump Said that the US Would Reclaim the Panama Canal\n\nBy Timothy Alexander Guzman, April 16, 2025\n\nUS aggression in Panama is following a blueprint to reclaim its “backyard” since China is wining influence and trade among Latin American nations. This is an insult to Panama, in fact, it’s an imperialist move that signifies that the Trump regime does not respect the sovereignty of the Panamanian people.\n\nYoung Ukrainian Pilots Keep Dying Pointlessly in Defunct NATO Jets Nearly Twice Their Age. “NATO puppets are sending them to a certain death”\n\nBy Drago Bosnic, April 16, 2025\n\nWhether it’s the “Abrams”, “Leopard” or “Challenger” tanks, various Western armored vehicles or fighter jets such as the “Mirage” 2000-5s or F-16s, young Ukrainians keep dying in these NATO-sourced steel coffins, while their country withers away in a pointless fight with a global superpower that also happens to be their closest kin.\n\nTrump Forces Declare War on Harvard\n\nBy Emanuel Pastreich, April 16, 2025\n\nTrump is not trying to return Harvard to its mission of pursuing scientific truth and scholarly integrity, but rather he is trying to make it conform with his demands for subservience so as to make it easier to make such demands of other institutions and thus establish a complete dictatorship.\n\nTikkun Olam: A Call for Justice Amidst the Tragedy in Israel\n\nBy Prof. Ruel F. Pepa, April 16, 2025\n\nIn the heart of Jewish thought lies a powerful and evolving concept: tikkun olam (תיקון עולם), which translates to “repairing the world.” Far from being a distant, abstract ideal, tikkun olam is a deeply rooted call to action—a moral and spiritual imperative for individuals and communities to engage with the world in the pursuit of justice, compassion, and fairness.\n\nAre Trump’s Tariffs Actually Hurting China?\n\nBy Peter Koenig, April 16, 2025\n\nTrump is a deal-maker, a gambler of sorts. Already more than 70 nations have requested “negotiating” the tariffs, that’s the “deal-making” Mr. Trump loves so much. At the same time, he believes in intimidating and dominating the world.\n\n“Israel Has a Right to Defend Itself” Is a Genocidal Slogan\n\nBy Caitlin Johnstone, April 17, 2025\n\nSanders has been mixing his support for Israel in with periodic criticisms of Netanyahu and the Israeli government’s actions in Gaza, always taking care to make his criticisms about the behavior of Israel’s current leadership and not the nature of the racist apartheid state itself.\n\nDanger in Trump’s Mind\n\nBy Kim Petersen, April 17, 2025\n\nIs the world to be based on inequality among its nations? If not, then a progressivist principle holds that each nation has an inalienable right to self-defense. One way to avert war is to balance the power. North Korea knows what happened to Libya. It is now nuclear armed and this serves as a deterrent to aggressive nations who might otherwise attack it. Iran knows this as well."}

But trying that on the latest Synology NAS hardware might see you shut out of some advanced features. Going forward, Synology is insisting that users stick with its pricey, self-branded hard drives for maximum feature support.\n\nGerman site HardwareLuxx reports that Synology Plus NAS hardware released in 2025 will not have full support for third-party drives. Though they’ll still work if you install them, only Synology’s hard drives—or those certified by Synology—will get access to the most advanced features, including hard drive health reports, volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates. Third-party drives that aren’t Synology-approved will get a warning in the user interface.\n\nSynology has already rolled out this requirement for enterprise-grade network-attached storage devices, but now the same standard is being applied to new consumer and prosumer models releasing in the future. The company claims that it needs the extra layer of hardware scrutiny in order to deliver the best performance and reliability.\n\nOf course, as Tom’s Hardware notes, Synology doesn’t actually manufacture its own hard drives. Reviewers and enthusiasts have determined that the Synology-branded drives being sold since 2021 are made by Toshiba and Seagate, two of the biggest hard drive manufacturers on the planet, only rivaled by Western Digital. Synology may have higher standards and more rigorous testing for drives bearing its brand name on the sticker… but it’s hard to forget that it is indeed just a sticker, especially if Synology is going to be a stickler about it.\n\nSynology devices made in 2024 and earlier won’t be affected by this change. Those who like to load up on cheap hard drives for their NASes might want to pay close attention to that, or possibly investigate offerings from competitors like Asustor or TerraMaster."}

Snag it fast before it’s gone!\n\nThe Odyssey G4 (exact model LS25BG402ENXGO) is a 25-inch IPS display made for gaming. The 1080p resolution isn’t ideal—the sweet spot is 1440p these days—but if you want high FPS gaming to take advantage of this display’s 240Hz, you’re probably playing at 1080p to crank out those frames anyway. Of course, you’ll need a powerful enough graphics solution to reach those frame rates.\n\nThe color-accurate IPS panel is what you need if you do any kind of creative work, but it’s also vibrant and vivid enough for immersive streaming of movies and TV shows. The Odyssey G4 also has a 1ms response time and comes with Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium support, so you get minimal tearing on compatible systems.\n\nOne drawback is that it doesn’t have a VESA mount, so you’ll need to use it with the included stand. Fortunately, the stand offers enough swivel, tilt, and height adjustments to get it where you need it to be.

It has a familiar 1440p resolution, a 240Hz refresh rate that’ll satisfy all but the twitchiest of multiplayer gamers, and support for Adaptive Sync if you’re playing something more cinematic.

It even includes a KVM switch for handling multiple input devices simultaneously.\n\nPixio is a budget brand, and if you’re looking for something from Alienware or another big name in this range, you might want to wait for one of those aforementioned holiday sales. But set your concerns aside because Pixio monitors have a two-year warranty on its panels and multiple Amazon reviewers say they’ve been pleased by the service when they needed to use it. That, uh, might be damning with faint praise.\n\nAmazon hasn’t marked this as a time-limited sale, so the $550 price might stick around for a while.

And boy, does it look phenomenal.\n\nI’ve had Ragebound on my radar for PC games that don’t need graphics cards since it was announced in December. Koei Tecmo teamed up with Dotemu and The Game Kitchen, developer of the highly-acclaimed 2D soulslike Blasphemous, for a throwback pixelated side-scroller. The initial trailer showed some blistering combat that reminded me of Dead Cells, but it’s the latest one that really made my eyes pop out:\n\nIn this trailer we see both new protagonists, Hayabusa clan protege Kenji Mozu and Spider clan assassin Kumori. It’s the latter who gets the spotlight here, showing off fluid moves and arachnid-themed special attacks. It looks like at least some parts of the game will let you switch between both fighters, or call the off-screen character in for a tag team attack.\n\nHalfway through the trailer Kumori hops on a motorcycle, in classic 80s beat-em-em up fashion. Then she hops on a demon. She butt-stomps a demon with a motorcycle, backflips her hog, then butt-stomps another before coming back to the ground. Hell yeah.\n\nNinja Gaiden: Ragebound is set for a summer 2025 release. It’s available to wishlist on Steam right now, and also coming to all consoles."}

Several student activists have been detained without charge by immigration officials.\n\nColumbia University has been at the forefront of this after the wave of pro-Palestinian protests that occurred at its New York City campus.\n\nEarlier this year, the Ivy League university agreed to put its Middle East studies department under new supervision and overhaul its rules for protests and student discipline, acquiescing to an extraordinary ultimatum by the Trump administration to implement those and other changes or risk losing billions of dollars in federal funding.\n\nThe Columbia Political Review is a student outlet at Columbia University that publishes op-eds, interviews, and political analysis on everything from campus news to international affairs. But lately, some contributors have been wary about writing on certain topics that could put them under an unwanted spotlight, says editor-in-chief Adam Kinder. Some have even asked to have their articles taken down.\n\nKinder spoke to Nil Kӧksal, host of CBC Radio's As It Happens. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nWhen people reach out to you and ask you to take down their articles, what kinds of reasons are they giving?\n\nWe've had writers in some cases provide nebulous justifications saying: \"Hey, I just really don't want my name out there right now.\" But, in other cases, we've had writers specifically cite what's going on and say: \"Hey, I would really just prefer to keep myself safe and to keep my family safe.\"\n\nThat said, in a general sense, I think for as much as people have been scared or are chilling their own speech as a result of the political atmosphere on campus and in the country right now, there's been a significant contingent of people that have also been galvanized by what's going on and are continuing to speak up.\n\nProtesters gather at Foley Square calling for the release of Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil in New York City on Monday. (Jeenah Moon/Reuters)\n\nSo people are still sending you their work and hoping to be published and getting their message across. But those people who reach out with those different reasons — sometimes vague, as you suggest there — what do you say to them?\n\nWe always offer them the ability to republish at any point that they would like. If somebody is taking the time to reach out to us to say: \"Hey, I would prefer my article is not up on the website right now,\" we oblige.\n\nAnd if they would like to comment on the situation in general, or if they still have some element of the argument that they want out there, then we encourage them to publish anonymously, which is a policy that we haven't really entertained in the past, but which now we're expanding and advertising and really getting out there to the whole student body.\n\nWhat is it like for you to have to take those articles down given the work you do?\n\nFortunately, these requests are not nearly like the deluge that I would imagine are coming to a lot of different publications. But it is saddening. I don't want to have our work or the work that we do with our writers placing anyone in, especially, physical danger. But, also, as a publication that relies on the principle and the practice of free speech, it's disappointing that our country has gotten to this point.\n\nWhat's encouraging is the fact that we are continuing our output at levels that are unprecedented — even for our history — and that people are interested, people are reading. We're getting our print magazine out next week. People are continuing to stay engaged despite how personally depressing the situation may seem.\n\nAdam Kinder, editor-in-chief of the Columbia Political Review, says students are thinking twice before speaking up. (Submitted by Adam Kinder)\n\nOne very vivid and recent example of someone's life being impacted and changed because of an opinion piece is Rumeysa Ozturk, the Tufts University student. She was taken into custody by [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and she has been in custody since last month. She had written an opinion piece calling on her own school to divest from companies that have ties to Israel. Were you expecting these kinds of requests to start coming in?\n\nAfter that, yes, absolutely.\n\nFortunately, again, we haven't seen nearly the flood that I've heard is occurring at different publications. Still, I've spoken with multiple writers — especially international students — who are worried. And to the extent that they've requested it, we've been willing to give people the ability to hold off from meeting their article minimums and things like that until we have a little bit more clarity about the situation in general, what seems to be safe to write about and what's not.\n\nThat said, we're always encouraging everyone to be honest and to write from their own perspective and not to moderate just to acquiesce in the way that the school's administration has to and what the government is demanding from students right now.\n\nStudents stage a walk-out protest at Columbia University’s Low Library steps to condemn the presence of U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement agents on campus, and call for Khalil's release. (Dana Edwards/Reuters)\n\nSo you've received about a dozen of these types of requests. What kinds of topics are we talking about here?\n\nWe've had probably about half-dozen people request takedowns, and about half-dozen more request hiatuses — so a total of a dozen.\n\nOverall, people are much more scared to talk about Palestine than anything else.\n\nBut now, because of heightened tensions between the U.S. and everywhere else — and especially international students that, for example, live in China — writing or being critical of either the U.S. or the Chinese government is another kind of sticking point that we're learning how to navigate as tensions are kind of inflamed.\n\nThere is a worry that this is going to extend beyond Gaza into other issues. For now, we have only heard mainly rumblings of that. My personal opinion is that soon — especially as a contestation between the Trump administration and universities heats up — that this is going to continue to escalate in ways that maybe we didn't expect.\n\nEarlier this year, the Ivy League university agreed to put its Middle East studies department under new supervision and overhaul its rules for protests and student discipline, acquiescing to an extraordinary ultimatum by the Trump administration to implement those and other changes or risk losing billions of dollars in federal funding. (Adam Gray/Reuters)\n\nHow will you brace for that — for the unexpected?\n\nThe approach that most aligns with what our function as a student publication is is to just keep on keeping on. To continue writing, to continue being transgressive where that's necessary, and to ultimately represent what the student body feels.\n\nAnd the student body feels very, very strongly about the direction that the university is taking in response to the government, the direction the country is headed right now and the direction of free speech on college campuses.\n\nWe are, at the end of the day, a venue to allow all voices on the undergraduate campus to speak — and we're going to continue to do that tenfold now."}

The sole named defendant in the case, an archivist from the Seattle area, denied any involvement with the site. After the court referred several scraping-related questions to the state Supreme Court, OCLC has now agreed to drop the alleged operator from the lawsuit.\n\nAnna’s Archive is a meta-search engine for shadow libraries that allows users to find pirated books and other related resources.\n\nIn late 2023, the search engine Anna’s Archive expanded its offering by making data from OCLC’s proprietary WorldCat database available online.\n\nAnna’s Archive scraped several terabytes of data over the course of a year and published roughly 700 million unique records online, for free.\n\nThese records contain no copyrighted books or articles. However, they can help to create a to-do list of all missing shadow library content on the web, with the ultimate goal of making as much content publicly available as possible.\n\nOCLC Sued Anna’s Archive\n\nThis ‘metadata’ heist was a massive breakthrough in the quest to archive as much published content as possible online. However, OCLC responded with a lawsuit filed at an Ohio federal court, accusing the site and its operators of hacking and demanding damages.\n\nThe non-profit says that it spent more than a million dollars responding to Anna’s Archive’s alleged hacking efforts. Even then, it couldn’t prevent the data from being released through a torrent.\n\nFollowing the alleged hacking efforts, OCLC attempted to identify the perpetrators. The investigation led them to Seattle resident Maria Dolores A. Matienzo, the sole named defendant in the case.\n\nThe complaint mentioned that Matienzo describes herself as an “archivist” and uses the handle “anarchivist” on social media and Github. The defendant was allegedly employed as a software engineer at an AI startup and previously worked as a catalog librarian at a direct competitor of OCLC.\n\nMaria A. Denies Involvement\n\nResponding to the allegations in court, Matienzo denied any involvement with Anna’s Archive.\n\n“I am not affiliated in any way with Anna’s Archive and had no involvement in the alleged hacking and/or scraping of data from WorldCat.org that was allegedly orchestrated and carried out by Anna’s Archive,” Matienzo wrote.\n\nIn a motion to dismiss, Matienzo’s attorney wrote that there is no “shred of evidence” that links the defendant to the search engine, let alone any of the alleged hacking or scraping efforts.\n\nAs the case progressed, no other defendants were identified. OCLC moved for a default judgment against the ‘unnamed’ operators, while Matienzo’s motion to dismiss was pending. Last month, however, an Ohio federal judge slammed on the brakes.\n\nIn a detailed order, Judge Watson expressed uncertainty about the legality of large-scale data scraping under state law.\n\nCiting this uncertainty, the judge denied OCLC’s request for default judgment against Anna’s Archive and denied Matienzo’s motion to dismiss without prejudice, pending clarification from the Supreme Court of Ohio, to which several core legal questions were referred.\n\nKey Defendant Dropped From Lawsuit\n\nDisappointed by the decision, OCLC asked the court to reconsider its position. It also requested the only named defendant to be dropped from the case, to focus on obtaining a final judgment against Anna’s Archive, which could help to get the associated domain names blocked.\n\nThe Ohio federal court initially denied the request over procedural issues, after which OCLC and Matienzo filed a joint motion this week, asking the court to drop the defendant from the case.\n\n“At this juncture of the proceedings, OCLC and Matienzo have reached an agreement that Matienzo be dropped from this action. As a result, OCLC no longer seeks relief from Matienzo in this action,” the joint motion reads.\n\nThis request has yet to be approved by the court but with agreement from both sides, that’s likely just a formality. And because the defendant will be dropped ‘with prejudice’, similar claims can’t be refiled against her at a later stage.\n\nFrom the public filings, it appears that OCLC has no idea who the real operators of Anna’s Archive are. There sure are plenty of archivists named Anna, but ideally, they need something more than association by name.\n\nInstant update: The motion to dismiss Matienzo from the case was granted.\n\n—\n\nA copy of the joint motion to drop defendant Maria Matienzo from the lawsuit, filed on Tuesday, is available here (pdf)"}

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nThe UK pedigree dog population shrank by a yearly decline of 0.9% between 1990 and 2021, according to research published in Companion Animal Genetics and Health. The study highlights a rise in the populations of crossbreeds and imported pedigree dogs since 1990, but finds that only 13.7% of registered domestic pedigree dogs were used for breeding between 2005 and 2015.\n\nThere are more than 400 breeds of dogs globally, characterized by different appearances and behaviors. While the overall population of pet dogs in the UK has increased from 7.6 million in 2012 to 12 million in 2021, limited genetic diversity in pedigree (or purebred) dog populations has heightened the risk of inherited diseases, supported by accumulating evidence for breed-specific diseases.\n\nJoanna Ilska and colleagues analyzed demographic data for 222 dog breeds from the Kennel Club's electronic database, including breed, parentage, and country of origin. The ten most popular pedigree dog breeds represented 44% of the whole pedigree population, with Labrador Retrievers, French Bulldogs, and Cocker Spaniels being the most common.\n\nThe researchers found that pedigree populations have decreased markedly since 2010. Yorkshire Terriers saw the largest decline in population of 10.6% from 1990 to 2021, while French Bulldogs saw the biggest increase of 22.1%.\n\nMeanwhile, trends for imported pedigree dogs rose sharply after 2010, with more than 3,000 dogs imported each year between 2011 and 2019. Ireland exported 11,577 dogs to the UK between 1990 and 2021, Russia exported 4,396 dogs, and Poland exported 3,905 dogs.\n\nThe authors suggest the pedigree population drop may be linked to negative attitudes towards dog breeding, compounded by the routine neutering of dogs—it is estimated that 44% of dogs in the UK are neutered. They note that the decline in the number of pedigree dogs may also reflect changing attitudes in favor of mixed and crossbred dogs, such as Cockapoos.\n\nIlska and co-authors suggest management strategies for pedigree dogs should account for declining population sizes and be tailored to the circumstances of individual breeds, with the increased number of imported dogs used in breeding potentially benefiting the overall genetic diversity of dog populations.\n\nMore information: Joanna Ilska, Modern pedigree dogs in the United Kingdom Kennel Club: a journey through shifting population landscapes and demography, Companion Animal Genetics and Health (2025).

In the parlance of cybersecurity, I had the wrong “threat model,” which is a fancy way of describing the risks I was seeking to mitigate. I had not considered that the United States might be swept into the rising tide of what scholars call “competitive authoritarianism” – authoritarian regimes that retain some of the trappings of democracy, such as elections, but use the power of the state to crush any meaningful dissent. ↫ Julia Angwin\n\nDemocracy is not nearly as much of a given as many people think, and in this day and age, where massive amounts of Americans’ data and personal information are collected and stored by the very corporations supporting the Trump regime, Americans have to think very differently about where digital threats actually come from.\n\nNothing protects any American – or anyone visiting America – from ending up in an El Salvadorian concentration camp.

In addition to the fallout from being declared a monopoly for search and browsers, an entirely separate case has just found Google guilty of monopoly practices in web advertising. It’s a huge blow.\n\nUS District Judge Leonie Brinkema found Google guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act by “willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power in the open-web display publisher ad server market and the open-web display ad exchange market.” Here’s a PDF of the ruling, via The Verge. It’s the conclusion of a case brought by the federal government and eight states over two years ago.\n\nThough Google competes in dozens of categories—from manufacturing its own phones to providing “big iron” data to some of the world’s biggest companies—advertising is arguably its most important business. Ads keep much of the web profitable and allow Google to provide its primary search engine for free, in addition to other services like Gmail, Google Docs, YouTube, etc. According to Statista, Google reaped over 250 billion US dollars from advertising in 2024, and Google owns 80 percent of the search market worldwide.\n\nThe determination that Google is operating an illegal monopoly—the second such determination from the US DOJ in two years—could be devastating to its business. The punishment or remedy currently isn’t known, but previous corporations found guilty of intentional monopoly behavior have been broken up or forced to divest themselves of portions of their business. That’s one possible end to the ongoing case: Google might be forced to sell or otherwise dispose of the Chrome browser.\n\nAnd the United States isn’t the only country with a bone to pick. In an earlier news story today, Google is facing a possible $6.6 billion USD fine in the United Kingdom, again, for violating its market-leading position in search. It’s only the lastest problem the company has had in the region, as the European Union has been cracking down on Google for advertising and other monopoly violations for over a decade.\n\nIt’s possible, though far from certain, that the US federal government might force Google to abandon both the advertising and browser markets in 2025. That would be absolutely devastating for the big G, though it has plenty of other assets that would allow it to survive in a diminished capacity. But full divestment is only one of many ways both cases could shake out, and Google will undoubtedly exhaust every option in its legal arsenal to mitigate the damage.

Between trying to decipher all the legal paperwork tied to my real estate purchase and figuring out how to decorate the space so it doesn’t feel cramped or tacky, there have been a lot of challenges to overcome.\n\nThankfully, I wasn’t alone in this. I had the help of my good friend, AI. I found myself leaning heavily on Gemini for the vast majority of issues I ran into, although I did switch over to NotebookLM for one specific, very important task.\n\nSimplifying legal lingo\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nThe paperwork involved with my real estate purchase was daunting — over a hundred pages, much of it filled with dense legal jargon that was incredibly hard to understand. This is where AI really helped me out.\n\nFor most of my document-related questions, I turned to Gemini. I could upload the files and ask specific questions about clauses or terms that confused me. For example, the warranty policy wasn’t clearly spelled out; it just referenced specific laws. Gemini was a lifesaver here. With a quick query, it explained the relevant laws and patiently answered all my follow-up questions, clarifying exactly what was covered and for how long.\n\nHowever, for deep dives into the entire document set, I switched to NotebookLM. Its ability to work within a defined set of sources made it perfect for this. I created a dedicated notebook containing all the documents related to my purchase. Whenever a question popped into my head — whether legal or just practical — NotebookLM could scan my documents and provide the answer in seconds. This saved me an incredible amount of time; otherwise, I’d easily have spent half an hour or more digging through those 100+ pages trying to find a single piece of information. The peace of mind knowing I could quickly verify details was invaluable.\n\nTackling interior design with Gemini Gemini was also a huge help with the interior design. If you’ve ever tried decorating a home from scratch without much experience, you know how tricky it is. It’s surprisingly easy to end up with a space that feels either cold and sterile or just plain tacky.\n\nGemini acted like my personal design consultant. It offered advice on everything from color schemes that would work well in my specific lighting conditions to maintaining visual balance and proportions between adjacent furniture items — like ensuring a large closet didn’t completely overpower the chest of drawers next to it.\n\nGemini was my personal design consultant.\n\nIt also helped with practical spatial planning, suggesting things like the minimum comfortable distance needed between the kitchen counter and the dining room table in my relatively narrow space, and advising on the right rug dimensions to anchor the living area without overwhelming it. I used a 3D home design planner tool to visualize these recommendations, and I have to say, the layout really came together beautifully thanks to Gemini’s input.\n\nIlluminating advice on lighting\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nThen there’s lighting — another surprisingly complex subject if you’re not familiar with the technicalities. I had to figure out and understand the difference between lumens (brightness) and kelvins (color temperature), and what could potentially work for me. Planning the perfect lighting across an entire apartment, especially considering different needs (brighter, whiter light in the kitchen for visibility vs. warmer, mellower light in the bedroom for relaxation), felt overwhelming.\n\nGemini stepped in here too. It easily calculated how many lumens I’d likely need for specific areas based on their size and function, suggested appropriate brightness levels (kelvin ranges) for different rooms, and more. It even helped me understand the ins and outs of the IKEA smart home lighting system I was considering — explaining how it works, giving an idea of the costs involved, and even estimating the potential impact on my electricity bill.\n\nBefore having an AI assistant like Gemini, I would have spent hours Googling, sifting through dozens of articles and forum posts, and likely still ending up with unanswered questions or conflicting advice.\n\nSolving unexpected problems Moving into a new place rarely goes perfectly smoothly. I ran into unexpected issues, like stubborn stains on the bathroom floor that really shouldn’t have been there. Gemini helped me brainstorm the most likely type of stain based on its appearance and location, and then suggested a range of cleaning methods to try, from gentle options to stronger solutions.\n\nUnfortunately, various minor defects were also part of my “brand new” real estate experience, and having Gemini provide quick summaries of my rights based on the legal documents (like warranty clauses) was incredibly helpful when communicating with the developer.\n\nTaking it a step further: Floor plan analysis\n\nRushil Agrawal / Android Authority\n\nFeeling ambitious, I took things up a notch by providing Gemini with the actual floor plan of my apartment and asking for furniture positioning advice. I was genuinely impressed with the suggestions.\n\nThe AI recommended practical ideas like “zoning” my living room. Since it’s part of an open-plan area combining living, dining, and kitchen, Gemini suggested using furniture arrangement and possibly a rug to visually separate the living space and make it feel more distinct. Given that my main living area is long and relatively narrow, it also smartly suggested using mirrors to create an illusion of spaciousness and opting for lighter-colored furniture to enhance that airy feeling.\n\nSome of these tips I might have come across eventually, but Gemini definitely sparked ideas I hadn’t considered and helped confirm some of my own instincts.\n\nWhat I wish Gemini could do next\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nWhile I thoroughly appreciated Gemini’s help throughout this process, the experience also highlighted areas where I wished AI could do even more.\n\nThe dream feature? Uploading my floor plan and having Gemini generate an interactive 3D model of the apartment. Imagine an AI that could then automatically suggest decoration schemes based on personal preferences (style, color, budget) and allow you to modify everything down to the smallest detail within that virtual space. I ended up using HomeStyler to create my 3D model and plan the layout, which was fun but definitely a time-consuming process. If Gemini had this capability built-in, it would have saved me hours and made the visualization process seamless.\n\nIt still feels a bit like science fiction, but I truly believe we’ll get to that point sooner rather than later. An AI that can not only advise but also visualize and implement design ideas in a virtual space? That will be a game-changer for anyone setting up a new home."}

Have you kept up with the digital correspondence between Ranters Scott Beuerlein and Marianne Willburn? You can start here, or go back and find the entire correspondence at Dear Gardener.\n\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nApril 16, 2025\n\nDear Marianne,\n\nGood Lord, Marianne, I’m in Cleveland! In the old days, I would have said I’m marooned in Cleveland, or forlorn in Cleveland, or that I must have died and been condemned to Cleveland, but that was way back when I was a mere indoctrinated Cincinnatian who had never been to Cleveland. And I would have ignorantly said one of those things only because it would have been expected of me.\n\nBut I’ve been here now. Two other times and today, and I’ve come to learn Cleveland is almost as cool as Cincinnati. It is Columbus that’s really the shithole town of Ohio, but somehow it always slides under the radar. The Cleveland Botanical Garden is right across the street. Case Western is all around me, including a Gehry building. The art museum, the orchestra, the natural history museum, all of it and more, is within walking distance. It’s like they decided during the cold war to put all the coolest stuff all in one place. That way, if we got bombed, all of it would go or none of it. Nobody would have to resent the art museum or some other place because it got spared and everything else was a goner.\n\nDid I say it was all within walking distance? Guess what? I took a walk. I’ve been steadily recovering from my long saga of suffering to the point where I was able to stroll around pain free after dinner. The first time in, probably, a year. Maybe two. Possibly three. What a joy! Seriously, it truly is the things we take for granted… But, fact is, after all this time I’m walking like a beginner. Loose. Like a drunk. No two steps exactly alike.\n\nAnd I saw lots of plants and had some thoughts. First Katsura. Remains my favorite tree. Truly greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nPinus densiflora umbraculifera (Tanyosho Pine), best bark to behold at dawn or dusk, although our far under-appreciated sycamore is not that far behind.\n\nNot long ago I was one of those assholes that had to join the chorus whenever somebody unloaded on hedges, and I will still say that not every homeowner needs to go out and hedge everything they own every Mother’s Day just because they’re certain they need to do something but they don’t know what. Fact is, sometimes hedges serve a purpose and sometimes they’re even pretty cool. If you don’t know too much. Or if you’ve had some wine. Marianne, I’ve had some wine. And, also, I’m knowing a lot less than I used to.\n\nI’m speaking to a bunch of gardeners tomorrow. A new talk called ‘Favorite Plants from Favorite Gardens.’ I gave it in Georgia last week and it went over well, so I’m reasonably confident it will go okay. Not even going to tweak it, unless I wake up at 4:00AM or 5:00AM in a sterile hotel room with no food and none of my stuff and no Michele around to wake up and annoy. If that happens, I’ll work on it some. The chance of that happening is, sadly, very high.\n\nThen I’ll give my talk and drive home and see the same things I saw when I drove up here today—muddy, dormant Ohio farm fields, big expanses of forest (in the North), and a bunch of pears in bloom along the highway. They came and went in Cincinnati. I wish I could enjoy them, but, damn, I know too much. At least for now.\n\nYeah, sure, yours,\n\nScott"}

We reported in August on Sage’s retraction of 467 articles from the journal. The publisher retracted another 416 papers in January. With this latest batch, “our investigation into JIFS is now concluded,” the spokesperson said.\n\nSage acquired JIFS in November 2023 when it bought IOS Press. The indexing company Clarivate raised concerns about the quality of the articles in the journal shortly after and put the journal’s indexing on hold. Its entry on the Clarivate website still shows the “on hold” flag.\n\nThe 1,561 retractions mark the most retractions from a single journal, according to the Retraction Watch Database. Also high on the list are journals with mass retractions following acquisitions, including the Journal of Health Care Engineering with 1,074 retractions and Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine with 1,065, both Hindawi journals acquired by Wiley (and later shuttered). Cureus has had 99 retractions since Springer Nature acquired them.\n\nThe April 17 retraction notice states:\n\nFollowing an investigation in line with the guidance issued by COPE, the publisher has detected one or more of the following indicators in submissions and in the peer review process underlying the acceptance of articles:\n\nPatterns of citation manipulation, including citations irrelevant to the research article Incoherent, extraneous text and Tortured phrases [1] Potential unauthorized third-party involvement in the submission process Evidence to suggest collusion between authors and reviewers that was not detected prior to publication Citations to research articles now retracted due to indicators of third-party involvement and manipulated peer review [2]\n\nThese indicators raise concerns about the authenticity of the research and the peer review process underlying the following articles.\n\nThe references cite a paper by sleuths Guillaume Cabanac, Cyril Labbé and Alexander Magazinov on tortured phrases (1), and a commentary by Cabanac on how problematic papers permeate the literature (2).\n\nThe retraction notice also “acknowledges the anonymous volunteers on PubPeer” as well as the Problematic Paper Screener “Feet of Clay” detector, which flags articles citing retracted papers.\n\nCitations to retracted papers are a valuable tool, William Black, CEO of PSIRef, noted in a comment on one of our previous stories. “A quick glance of the reference lists sorted by publication date in reverse chronological order clearly shows the vastness of the paper mill(s) that have used this journal as a conduit,” he wrote. Nearly 2,450 of the journal’s articles turn up on PSIRef, which aggregates retractions, expressions of concern, PubPeer comments and other public comments on scholarly articles.\n\nThe authors of most of the retracted papers are from India and China; our independent check of about 200 of the papers also finds authors from Pakistan, Turkey, Iraq, Iran and several other countries.\n\nThe names of 25 authors appear on five or more of the papers, by our count. Of that group, four authors have had previous retractions from JIFS and at least three authors have retractions that were part of the more than 13,000 retractions from Hindawi journals.\n\nCengiz Kahraman of Istanbul Technical University was an author on 20 of the retracted papers, the most in the batch, our analysis found. He disagrees with the retractions. “They made it without any reason and evidence,” Kahraman told us by email. “I think they used an AI software producing nonsense conclusions.”\n\nZeshui Xu of Sichuan University had the next highest tally of 14 articles. Xu has six previous retractions, all from JIFS, according to the Retraction Watch Database. Xu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRoughly half of the newly retracted papers were published in 2023 and 2024, although the dates extend as far back as 2014.\n\nSage paused publishing at the journal while it conducted its investigation. JIFS has resumed publishing, with three new articles published this month.\n\n— With additional reporting by Alison Abritis and Avery Orrall\n\nLike Retraction Watch?

These mad lads made Linux look like Windows XP!", "fullContent": "PC users who want to relive the nostalgia of an older Windows interface can download the free Linux distribution Q4OS and install the XPQ4 G UI. The GUI makes it possible to activate different interfaces within the Debian-based distribution Q4OS.\n\nIn addition to Windows XP, you can also choose interfaces that mimic Windows 2000, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10. While you can install and use Linux applications, the system offers a familiar graphical user interface that behaves like Windows, making it easier to navigate.\n\nThomas Joos\n\nYou can also run the system as a live installation using a USB stick. Since it’s available as an ISO file, it’s also possible to test the distribution in a VM. The Q4OS interface is already similar to Windows. By installing XPQ4, the aforementioned Windows interfaces can be activated. The developers of XPQ4 also offer a ready-made live environment with Q4OS in which XPQ4 is already installed and ready to use.\n\nUsing Windows XP with Linux (even without installation)\n\nTo use Windows XP via Q4OS/XPQ4, download the ISO file for XPQ4 as FreeXP from the developers. The best way to do this is to use the ‘FreeXP live CD image’ option under ‘Downloads.’ If you want to use Windows 10 with Linux on the basis of Q4OS and XPQ4, you can also use the ‘Free10 live CD image.’ The Windows 10 interface is available here, but without the option of activating older versions such as Windows XP. If you start this image, you’ll receive a Windows 10 interface based on Q4OS and XPQ4.\n\nThomas Joos\n\nTo start a PC with Q4OS, whether you’re using the Windows XP or Windows 10 interface, you can use tools like Rufus or balenaEtcher. Using Rufus as an example, connect the USB stick to your PC, start Rufus, and select the USB stick under ‘Drive.’ Under ‘Startup type,’ click on ‘Selection’ and pick the desired ISO file. You can leave the other settings as default. Click ‘Start’ to begin creating the stick. If you boot a PC, FreeXP or Free10 will start directly with the stick.\n\nThomas Joos\n\nLogging on to Windows XP under Q4OS\n\nThe default login for Q4OS utilizes the user name “adminq” and a blank password. You can also customize the language of the user interface during startup. After logging in, the operating system will automatically activate the Windows XP interface if you’ve started the FreeXP version.\n\nWith the Windows 10 version, the Windows 10 interface will start instead. The functionality of FreeXP resembles Windows XP or whichever Windows version you’ve selected.\n\nCustomize the Windows interface\n\nYou can customize the displayed Windows version at any time using the ‘XPQ4 Desktop Styles’ tool. The different Windows versions are available for selection in the ‘Themes’ column. These include Windows XP with the classic view, Windows XP with the familiar colorful Luna interface, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, and Windows 2000.\n\nThomas Joos\n\nClick on a theme and select ‘Apply Theme.’ Next, select ‘Logout now.’ After logging out, log in with the user ‘adminq’ without a password.\n\nWorking with Windows under Q4OS\n\nThe operation of the respective Windows interface is similar to that of Windows. There are, of course, a few differences, as the system is based on Debian Linux with Q4OS. The Q4OS welcome screen enables the installation of programs via the ‘Install programs’ button. More features can be activated with ‘More options’ such as various graphical effects. The interface and general display can be customized via ‘Desktop Profiler.’\n\nThomas Joos\n\nInstalling Q4OS with XPQ4\n\nInstead of just testing the FreeXP live CD, you can also install the operating system. To do so, click on ‘Install Q4OS,’ which will launch the installation wizard directly in the user interface. This allows you to select the language, the keyboard model, and the Q4OS variant. It makes sense to select ‘Q4OS Desktop’ at this point. You can also specify the partitioning here. As part of the setup, you can set up your own user account with a test password. If desired, you can enable automatic login for FreeXP.\n\nOnce the wizard is complete, the installation will begin. The operating system will be available on the PC when the installation finishes. After restarting, the user can log in with the new user name and password."}

But how do you know if you really need one?\n\nThe direct answer is: If you game on consoles and want to record or stream content from them, then — yes, you will need one. Then again, if you’re just wanting to stream or record gameplay from your PC, a capture card is generally not needed, with the odd exception.\n\nWhat is a capture card?\n\nIn a nutshell, a capture card captures an input signal from a device like a game console, camera, or computer and converts it into a digital signal format that can be saved, edited, or even broadcast live via your PC.\n\nA capture card also acts as a passthrough device allowing the video and audio signal to pass through it to be displayed on a monitor, so that you can see what you’re recording or streaming in real time. Want to stream or record Let’s Plays and strike it rich on Twitch? Then a capture card can make that happen.\n\nThese devices come in two main types: There are the internal capture cards, like the Elgato Game Capture 4K60 Pro Mk.2, that need to be installed directly into your motherboard via a PCIe slot, or there’s the external variety, like the AVerMedia 4K capture card.\n\nBoth options can capture great quality video but there are pros and cons of each. Internal cards benefit from your PC’s fast PCIe bandwidth, so their latency is excellent, but they have to stay put in your motherboard.\n\nOn the other hand, external cards may have slightly higher latency but have become quite popular because of their portability — they require no installation and can be used on the fly with a laptop.\n\nMost external capture cards require an HDMI cable connection to the device to capture the content, but a USB cable will usually suffice as the connection between the card and your PC. These cards also come compatible with different streaming software apps, like Twitch, YouTube, OBS, XSplit, and Streamlabs.\n\nIt’s important to note that a capture card isn’t a way to spare your PC from experiencing lag. You’re still going to need some decent hardware to deal with the load on your CPU and GPU from recording or streaming.\n\nRecording or streaming from your PC\n\nThe reason you can pass on buying a capture card if you intend on streaming or recording directly from your PC is simply because the signal is coming directly from it; there’s no need for any signal conversion or passthrough.\n\nInstead of buying a capture card, you just need good video recording or streaming software — like the apps I mentioned above.\n\nThe one time you might want to invest in a capture card if you’re just working with your PC, however, is if you’re capturing directly from a DLSR camera. In this case the video source will likely need proper conversion or passthrough for your PC to read the signal.\n\nCapture cards can be internal or external to your PC. Pictured is the Elgato HD60 X external capture card. Elgato\n\nAnother common question gamers ask is whether they need a capture card if they own a PlayStation 5 console, because of the fact the PS5 can record video directly. In this case, you should probably still get one, since a capture card will give you better-quality video, and you will also enjoy more options to save and import your videos.\n\nHow to find the right capture card\n\nOnce you’ve decided on either an external or internal capture card, the next step is to decide on the resolution. Most capture cards can record video at either 1080p, 1440p, or 4K.\n\nIf you plan on recording at 4K, the main thing to check for is that the capture card has 4K passthrough. Getting a 4K-capable card will also future proof your purchase — it’s what more content creators will be capturing as internet bandwidths continue to improve.\n\nMost 4K capture cards also allow you to record at lower resolutions — say 1080p. If you have a high refresh-rate monitor or TV, your videos will have a higher FPS rate than if you were to record at 4K too, so they’ll be less prone to motion blur.\n\nYou should also check that the capture card you’re considering has the right kind of interface for your PC. Checking that it supports USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, or a combination of these ports, can save you the hassle of having to buy adapters.\n\nSo, in summary, a capture card is most useful if you want to try your hand at streaming or recording Let’s Plays or other content from your game consoles or other devices. If that’s your schtick, you should definitely go ahead and get one."}

I beg you to consider a mini PC instead", "fullContent": "For most people, a laptop is the default option when shopping for a new computer. It can work at home, it can work on the go, and it has everything built right into it: a screen, a keyboard, a trackpad, speakers, a webcam, and the computer itself.\n\nBut as convenient as that might be, a laptop might not be the best choice depending on how you’re going to use it. You may not need the whole kit and kaboodle. Plus, there’s a good bit of engineering that goes into laptop designs — and that adds to the cost.\n\nIf your laptop is going to be used at home all the time, tethered to your desk with an external monitor and keyboard and mouse, and you’re only picking a laptop because you don’t want to spend tons for a bulky pre-built desktop PC… then consider a mini PC instead.\n\nMini PCs offer several benefits over laptops that are totally worth it if you don’t need the innate portability that laptops offer.\n\nMini PCs are more economical Jared Newman / Foundry While there’s no guarantee that a mini PC will always be cheaper than an equivalent laptop, it’s typically true that you can get a solid mini PC for a lower price than you’d pay for a laptop with similar hardware. That’s because the mini PC can forego the costs of other elements that aren’t included: display, keyboard, mouse, speakers, battery, etc. If you already have all that stuff, or if you plan to equip your laptop with lots of external peripherals, then you’re wasting money with a laptop. For an extreme example that drives home the point, compare the M2 Mac Mini with the M2 MacBook Air. By skipping out on all the other “laptop” elements, the Mac Mini only costs $599 — significantly less than the MacBook Air’s $999 price tag. Which means if you’re in the market for a specific range (e.g., entry-level, mid-tier, high-end), then you’ll likely pay less for the same options if you go with a mini PC instead of a laptop. Mini PCs have better performance\n\n\n\nMini PCs have an advantage that allows for even greater performance than you’d get in similar laptops: they aren’t constrained by the size limitations that laptops require, so mini PCs have greater freedom when it comes to their internal components. The physical design of a laptop determines how air flows through the laptop, which affects cooling. Laptops have to balance heat management with performance. Meanwhile, mini PCs can shape themselves however they want — and with more effective cooling, they can push their components further and eke out more performance. For example, the $479 Beelink SER8 runs its Ryzen 7 8745HS CPU fast enough to score over 13,000 points in Cinebench R23’s multi-core test and 1,600 points in its single-core test. That puts it pretty close to the $850 Asus Zenbook 14 OLED laptop, which scores 13,777 and 1,508 in the same tests, respectively — and that’s with a Ryzen 7 8840HS CPU, which is an upgrade over the mini PC’s chip. It’s a similar story on the Mac side of things. Our friends over at MacWorld saw the $699 M1 Mac Mini outperform the $999 M1 MacBook Air in Cinebench R23 and Geekbench 5 tests. Talk about huge savings! buy the beelink ser8 on amazon Mini PCs don’t have batteries Panos Sakalakis / Unsplash Ignoring the cost and performance factors that push mini PCs ahead of laptops, here’s another big one to consider: since mini PCs aren’t portable, they don’t have any batteries. Batteries can be problematic, not just in laptops but in any portable device. The constant charging and discharging generates extra heat that can harm the other internal components if pushed too hard, and it also wears down on the battery’s lifespan. Mini PCs have fewer parts to worry about as far as longevity is concerned, which means they generally last longer. Mini PCs are easier to upgrade Jared Newman / Foundry Most laptops don’t have enough internal space for upgrades. Maybe you can swap out a piece here and there, but generally you’re stuck with whatever configuration you buy. Mini PCs are a different story. The $399 GMKTec M5 Plus Gaming might be a mini PC, but it’s spacious enough for an M.2 slot, a 2.5-inch SATA slot, and two SO-DIMM slots. So, despite coming with an M.2 drive, you can upgrade with an extra SATA drive if you want to — and you can upgrade the RAM modules beyond the initial configuration, even though this model already comes with an ample 32GB installed. In fact, a quick search for “mini PC” on Newegg shows that most available mini PCs explicitly offer user-accessible RAM and support multiple storage drives (i.e., both SATA and M.2 slots).\n\nMeanwhile, modern laptops typically come with a single M.2 slot with no room for an extra drive, and they commonly come with RAM modules that are soldered on. This means you can only upgrade your data drive by replacing it and you can’t upgrade your RAM at all. buy the GMKtec M5 Plus on amazon\n\nFurther reading: Killer PC upgrades that are shockingly cheap Mini PCs have more ports Newegg As laptops have gotten slimmer and smaller, certain aspects had to be sacrificed to get there — like ports and connectivity. These days, you’d be lucky to get two USB ports and a headset jack. Bonus points if you also get an HDMI port. High-end laptops in particular have just about given up on ports, such as the Dell XPS 13 that only offers two USB-C ports. This means an extreme reliance on hubs and docks. Mini PCs play to a different tune. The very first mini PC in my Newegg search includes four USB-A ports on one side, and then two HDMI 2.0 ports, two Ethernet ports, and a headset jack on another side. And that’s not even one of the more impressive mini PCs. The $647 Minisforum UM890 Pro has four 10Gbps USB-A ports, two HDMI ports capable of 4K@120Hz, as well as USB4 and DisplayPort outputs, dual 2.5Gbps Ethernet ports, and a headset jack. buy the Minisforum UM890 Pro on Newegg\n\nMini PCs might be just what you need\n\nIn short, mini PCs offer more bang for your buck than laptops, able to wring out more performance from equivalent hardware and costing less than laptops on the same tier.\n\nOf course, you’re giving up the innate portability of a laptop by opting for a mini PC, but that’s fine if you’re always at home anyway. You’ll also have to provide your own keyboard, mouse, and monitor, but you can get them for cheap and still pay less than you would for a laptop.\n\nIf you’re in the market for a new device and you think your only choices are laptop, desktop, or tablet, think again. The mini PC might be exactly the thing that serves you best for the price.

The Dutch defender’s renewal comes hot on the heels of Mohamed Salah agreeing fresh terms, signalling a clear intent from Liverpool to retain the experienced core of the squad under Arne Slot’s leadership.\n\nThis deal marks another important chapter in Van Dijk’s already iconic Liverpool career, which began in January 2018 and has since included a cabinet full of trophies, individual accolades, and now, a renewed commitment to the club he proudly calls home.\n\nCaptain Commits to Future at Anfield\n\nSpeaking to Liverpoolfc.com, Van Dijk expressed his emotions about signing the new deal:\n\n“I’m very happy, very proud. There are so many emotions obviously that go through my head right now speaking about it. It’s a proud feeling, it’s a feeling of joy. It’s just incredible. The journey I’ve had so far in my career, to be able to extend it with another two years at this club is amazing and I’m so happy.”\n\nThere had never been much speculation about Van Dijk leaving, and the 33-year-old made it crystal clear that his heart has always been with the club:\n\n“It was always Liverpool. That was the case. It was always in my head, it was always the plan and it was always Liverpool.”\n\n“There wasn’t any doubt in my head that this is the place to be for me and my family. I’m one of Liverpool. Someone called me the other day an adopted Scouser – I’m really proud to hear these things, it gives me a great feeling.”\n\nThese quotes echo the kind of loyalty and passion that Liverpool fans love to see from their players, especially from someone who has come to define the modern era of success at Anfield.\n\nA Defensive Giant Since Day One\n\nSince his then-world-record move for a defender from Southampton in 2018, Van Dijk has completely transformed Liverpool’s back line. His composure, athleticism, and leadership have been integral to the club’s recent trophy haul. To date, he has made 314 appearances and scored 27 goals – not bad for a centre-back.\n\nHis trophy list includes:\n\nPremier League\n\nChampions League\n\nFIFA Club World Cup\n\nUEFA Super Cup\n\nFA Cup\n\nTwo League Cups\n\nFew defenders in world football have matched Van Dijk’s combination of aerial dominance, positional awareness, and calmness under pressure over the past five years. His arrival coincided with Liverpool’s return to elite status in Europe and England, making him arguably the most important signing of the Jürgen Klopp era.\n\nRecognition on and off the Pitch\n\nVan Dijk’s excellence hasn’t gone unnoticed outside Liverpool either. He was named the PFA Players’ Player of the Year in 2019, was runner-up to Lionel Messi in the Ballon d’Or vote that same year, and has been selected in the PFA Team of the Year four times.\n\nNow in his 30s, Van Dijk may not have the speed he once did, but his reading of the game, leadership, and presence are as valuable as ever. In fact, he’s played 44 games in the 2024-25 season already, with 3987 minutes under his belt and 181 aerial duels contested. These numbers show that he’s not just a symbolic figure—he’s still a vital one.\n\nLooking Ahead Under Slot\n\nVan Dijk assumed the captain’s armband in the summer of 2023, and under Arne Slot, he’s helped guide a new-look Liverpool squad through a transition phase. With youth coming through and changes to the backroom team, his experience and influence are more crucial than ever.\n\nThis contract extension sends a strong signal: Liverpool are not ready to let go of their elite standards or identity. Keeping players like Van Dijk and Salah reinforces a winning culture and provides a strong foundation for the next chapter at Anfield.\n\nSlot will undoubtedly be pleased to know his captain is not only committed but still performing at a top level. With eyes firmly set on domestic and European honours, Van Dijk’s leadership could once again prove pivotal as Liverpool look to reclaim the Premier League crown and compete deep into the Champions League.\n\nConclusion\n\nVirgil van Dijk’s contract extension is more than just good news—it’s a declaration of Liverpool’s intent. In a time of squad turnover and new beginnings, keeping one of the best defenders in the world is a move that keeps the Reds grounded in quality, leadership, and ambition.\n\nFrom his commanding presence at the back to his calm authority as captain, Van Dijk has already etched his name into Anfield folklore. Now, with his future secured, Liverpool fans can look forward to more iconic moments from their No.4—an adopted Scouser who continues to give everything for the badge."}

With Trent Alexander-Arnold widely expected to join Real Madrid at the end of the season upon the expiration of his contract, a new long-term plan is needed by the Reds Sporting Director, Richard Hughes, to supplement his head coach, Arne Slot. While Conor Bradley has emerged as a promising academy graduate, Liverpool may benefit from bridging the gap with a proven Premier League option, one that has been linked previously.\n\nThat’s where Ola Aina enters the conversation. The Nottingham Forest fullback, who has been arguably the most consistent right-back in the division this season, is out of contract this summer and would represent one of the smartest free transfer moves the club could make.\n\nOla Aina – Player Profile\n\nClub – Nottingham Forest\n\nNationality: Nigeria (homegrown)\n\nAge: 28 years old\n\nDate of Birth: October 8, 1996\n\nPosition: Fullback (Right-Back / Left-Back)\n\nHeight: 1.84 m\n\nPreferred Foot: Right\n\n2024/25 Appearances: 28 (all competitions)\n\nContract Expiry: June 30, 2025\n\nInternational Caps – 46 Appearances\n\nTransfermarkt Value – €20m\n\nExpected Fee – Free\n\nOla Aina NOT even being linked to LFC is pathetic. He's a free transfer at the end of the season and its a no brainer. Defensively fantastic and has had a wonderful season with Forest 🤔 Would you take Ola Aina? pic.twitter.com/8QOxrK6QZv — 𝗟𝗙𝗖 𝗨𝗻𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱 🐦‍🔥 (@LFCUNLOCKED) April 11, 2025\n\nA Ready-Made Senior Option\n\nIn an ideal scenario, Liverpool’s right-back structure for 2025/26 would include Conor Bradley continuing his development through managed minutes, while an experienced defender starts the majority of matches across four competitions. Ola Aina fits this profile perfectly — a seasoned Premier League campaigner with over 100 appearances in the division and a growing influence at Nottingham Forest. Within an outstanding season at the City Ground, the likes of Morgan Gibbs White, Murillo, and Aina, have been outstanding performers who may now look towards the next step in their careers. All of the above have been partially linked with a move to Anfield and it would not be a surprise if the latter became a serious option, one that would cost nothing apart from an immediate and handsome signing-on fee.\n\nThe output of the player paints the picture of a fullback who combines athleticism with positional intelligence. Defensively sharp and comfortable driving forward, Aina has quietly become one of the Premier League’s most reliable performers in his position and instead of trying to replicate the offensive output of a Trent Alexander Arnold, an increased level of power and assurance could be used that allows for a more explosive left back to be targeted on the other flank.\n\nA Stopgap and Mentor for Bradley\n\nWhat makes this a truly sensible move is what it means for Conor Bradley. Rather than forcing the 20-year-old into the fire as the full-time starter following Alexander-Arnold’s likely departure, Aina would give Liverpool breathing room whilst increasing the defensive stability. His arrival would allow Slot’s staff to monitor Bradley’s development in a lower-pressure environment while still retaining the attacking fluidity Liverpool thrives on from its fullbacks.\n\nMuch like what Liverpool has done with Curtis Jones and Jarell Quansah — giving young talent minutes within a structured rotation — Aina’s presence would make that possible at right-back and allow a season to truly assess what is needed to replace an all-time great and world-class talent.\n\nIf this is the plan, then Ola Aina makes plenty of sense. Free, solid, good injury record, covers RB and LB and we never have to see Quansah at RB. https://t.co/7BynT8GEeQ — Peter Pancreatitis (@joel_biostat) April 14, 2025\n\nA Free Transfer with High Value\n\nLiverpool, like every top club, must be savvy in the market — and free transfers are no longer just short-term fixes. Aina, at 28, is in his prime. His signing would not require a transfer fee and would meet both performance and homegrown registration criteria. He’s experienced, versatile, physically durable, and used to high-pressure situations.\n\nWith Manchester City and other top sides reportedly monitoring his situation, Liverpool would be wise to move quickly and could offer an immediate pathway into a team which by then will be the Premier League champions.\n\nWhy It Makes Perfect Sense\n\nIn a summer where money will be spent on a specialist defensive midfielder, a new left-back, a new striker, a wide forward and potentially a centre-back, the right-back slot could be solved without a major outlay. Ola Aina represents the type of smart, undervalued opportunity that top sides must capitalise on — a low-risk, high-reward signing who can contribute immediately.\n\nThe long-term plan might still revolve around Conor Bradley, but Aina gives Liverpool a crucial piece for the present. If the club is to move forward without Alexander-Arnold, this is the kind of deal that keeps them steady in the transition. The next right-back might already be proven in the Premier League. And crucially, he wouldn’t cost a penny."}

With Trent Alexander-Arnold expected to leave for Real Madrid and the creative burden of the team set to shift, the club faces a unique opportunity to inject world-class experience into the heart of the squad.\n\nEnter Kevin De Bruyne. The Manchester City legend, whose contract expires at the end of the 2024/25 season, is widely expected to leave Pep Guardiola’s side as the club faces scrutiny over their 115 FFP charges. De Bruyne, a reported lifelong Liverpool fan and close friend of Virgil van Dijk, represents not just a luxury addition—but a potentially transformative one that could bolster the ranks of a team that will want to win more trophies instead of falling to stagnation in transition.\n\n🚨| @destandaard – The possibility of De Bruyne joining a rival side like Liverpool isn’t out of the question, with the club holding a special connection to his family. pic.twitter.com/rRjUUX0uaa — Anfield Edition | æ (@AnfieldEdition) April 16, 2025\n\nKevin De Bruyne – Player Profile\n\nClub: Manchester City\n\nNationality: Belgium\n\nAge: 33 years old\n\nDate of Birth: June 28, 1991\n\nPosition: Central Midfield / Attacking Midfield\n\nHeight: 1.81 m\n\nPreferred Foot: Right\n\n2024/25 Appearances: 33 (all competitions)\n\nGoals: 5\n\nAssists: 8\n\nContract Expiry: June 30, 2025\n\nInternational Caps: 101 (Belgium)\n\nExpected Fee: Free\n\nAn Experienced Game-Changer Still Operating at the Elite Level\n\nDespite his age, De Bruyne continues to deliver world-class output, despite his team largely struggling this season. His recent man-of-the-match performance in City’s 5-2 win over Crystal Palace—where he contributed a goal and an assist—was a timely reminder of his ability to control and elevate games single-handedly.\n\nIn 2024/25 alone, De Bruyne ranks among the Premier League’s best for:\n\nKey Passes per 90: 3.21\n\nShot-Creating Actions per 90: 5.\n\nProgressive Passes per 90: 8.12\n\nExpected Assists (xA): 9.9 (2nd in the league)\n\nWith Alexander-Arnold’s departure looming, De Bruyne could offer a different—but equally devastating—form of creativity. Slot’s system will value De Bruyne’s vision, ability to dictate tempo, and world-class delivery from open play and set pieces. With a defensive midfielder and two attackers set to join alongside two new starting-level fullbacks, the elite-level output of the Belgium legend would offer a calming brilliance that could ease this transitional 2025/26 season.\n\nA Milner-Like Moment, Reimagined for a New Era\n\nLiverpool’s history with elite free transfers offers precedent: James Milner and Joel Matip arrived on frees and went on to play crucial roles in title-winning sides. De Bruyne, even at 33, offers an even higher ceiling. Managed smartly, surrounded by high-energy options like Szoboszlai, Jones, Gravenberch, and Mac Allister, the Belgian maestro could prolong his effectiveness—à la Luka Modrić at Real Madrid.\n\nAnd if his time at City is coming to a close, there’s precedent for what might come next. Andrea Pirlo was dismissed as “past it” by Milan at 31—only to become the heartbeat of Juventus for four stunning years, winning four Serie A titles and being named Serie A Player of the Year three times.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lfctransferroom/status/1912527744623051162?s=46&t=rxgukmqdoXc4muVFLSx2EQ\n\nWhy Liverpool Makes Sense—For Both Parties\n\nThis isn’t about sentiment. It’s about impact. While Richard Hughes and the FSG model may favour youth, the contract extensions for Salah and van Dijk reflect a willingness to maintain a core of leadership and elite performance. De Bruyne fits into that same bracket: a short-term project with massive upside, who could act as a mentor and match-winner while Liverpool transitions toward a new tactical identity.\n\nWith younger legs around him and a defined role under Arne Slot, De Bruyne could become a bridge between Liverpool’s past and its future—filling the creative void left by Alexander-Arnold, and lifting the ceiling for what this new-look side can achieve.\n\nFor a team on the brink of another cycle of success, this could be the Pirlo moment. And perhaps, finally, De Bruyne gets to wear the shirt he’s loved all along."}

We’re not going anywhere,” Hendrick proclaimed, quoting The Wire’s Stringer Bell with an audible grin. It’s a rallying cry for Reds everywhere — and a hammer blow to rival fans who “spend the prophesising that we were done.”\n\nBoth Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk are now locked in, quashing rumours that this season was their swansong. “Mo signed. Virgil signed. Both of them locked in. Both of them hungry for more silverware,” Hendrick emphasised.\n\nIrreplaceable At The Back\n\nIn his breakdown, Hendrick didn’t shy away from acknowledging just how monumental Van Dijk’s presence is to this Liverpool team. “He’s the best centre-back on the planet and it’s not close,” he asserted, with a pointed jab at “pretenders” like William Saliba.\n\nHendrick put it plainly: “If Virgil was leaving this summer… we would need to spend probably in the region of £75 to £80 million, maybe even more.” The shortlist of players who could match Van Dijk’s quality is short and elite. “There really is only one which is Alessandro Bastoni,” he noted, before explaining the challenges of adapting to a new system.\n\nOther potential replacements like Jarrad Branthwaite, Levi Colwill, or Ousmane Diomande might take “two years to hit that top level.” And even then, Hendrick cautioned, “I’m not saying the Virgil level… that’s a level that three or four centre-backs ever have reached.”\n\nBuilt Different: The Mentality of a Legend\n\nMore than just talent, Van Dijk’s mindset sets him apart. Hendrick revealed, “Virgil believes that he can maintain his form for three or four more years… Virgil has embraced the grind.” In his view, the Dutchman is chasing longevity like “LeBron James, Roger Federer, Tom Brady — the true greats.”\n\nAs Hendrick has said many times before, “Thiago Silva couldn’t lace Virgil van Dijk’s boots… even in his prime.” And yet Silva was starting for Chelsea at 39. “There’s no reason to think [Van Dijk] couldn’t play another four.”\n\nNew Era Under Arne Slot\n\nThis new contract signals more than just a retained player — it’s a commitment to Liverpool’s future, now under Arne Slot following Jürgen Klopp’s departure. Hendrick didn’t mince words: “There’s no replicating Virgil. Because of the nature of the position he plays, you just can’t do it.”\n\nThat’s why this moment feels monumental. Liverpool have secured their cornerstone. While other areas of the squad may evolve, the centre of defence will remain anchored by a Rolls-Royce of a defender. “That’s the base of your team. It’s the bedrock of your team,” said Hendrick, capturing the weight of the decision."}

Funding for the program that manages the CVE database nearly expired this week, potentially endangering global cybersecurity coordination efforts. Although the crisis was averted at the last minute, the cybersecurity community has begun taking steps to avoid a repeat.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security has extended funding for the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, which was set to expire on Wednesday. Experts warn that the program is critical for worldwide cybersecurity efforts.\n\nCVE codes provide a standardized system that enables tech companies, researchers, and hackers to identify and address vulnerabilities. For example, security advisory pages from Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla, and other firms use the system to label issues. Although entities across the globe rely on CVE codes to ensure they are discussing the same vulnerabilities, it is dependent on a government-funded program operated by the MITRE Corporation.\n\nBREAKING. From a reliable source. MITRE support for the CVE program is due to expire tomorrow. The attached letter was sent out to CVE Board Members.\n\n\n\n[image or embed] – Tib3rius (@tib3rius.bsky.social) April 15, 2025 at 1:23 PM\n\nYosry Barsoum, vice president and director of the Center for Securing the Homeland, sent a memo alerting CVE board members that funding was set to expire on April 16. Why the DHS nearly allowed CVE funding to lapse is unclear, but the incident occurred amid the Trump administration's aggressive government cost-cutting campaign.\n\nExperts quickly raised alarms, highlighting CVE's importance. Jen Easterly, former director of the US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), called CVE the Dewey Decimal System of cybersecurity. She explained that its lapse would slow global cybersecurity coordination efforts because different organizations might waste time retracing each other's steps. Such a situation might weaken responses to new threats and give attackers an advantage.\n\nOn Wednesday, a group of CVE board members established the CVE Foundation, a separate non-profit focused solely on maintaining the CVE database in case MITRE's funding expired. The move follows over a year of planning, and the foundation is expected to release more information on its efforts in the coming days. European cybersecurity groups also recently established the European Union Vulnerability Database, which includes CVE codes and a new system of IDs carrying the EUVD label.\n\nAlthough DHS funding has resumed, the extension lasts only 11 months, and the likelihood of a renewal in March 2026 is unclear. The funding also impacts the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) program."}

Shukla/CINECA and Instituto Superior Técnico, Portugal\n\nN. Shukla/CINECA and Instituto Superior Técnico, Portugal ×\n\nDark matter, by definition, does not participate in electromagnetic interactions. But some theories include a dark matter analogue of this familiar force. These theories imply that dark matter particles might possess positive or negative “dark charges” and thereby experience attractive or repulsive forces. Now Kevin Schoeffler at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany and colleagues have sought evidence of such interactions in the distribution of dark matter around a pair of colliding galaxy clusters [1]. Finding none, the researchers have set an upper bound on the strength of possible dark electromagnetism.\n\nIn a previous study, Schoeffler and colleagues simulated the collision of two clouds of plasma that pass through one another [2]. They found that, as the clouds merge, electromagnetic instabilities develop. These instabilities redistribute energy from the clouds’ opposing flows, slowing the clouds while broadening their range of temperatures.\n\nThe researchers’ current work was motivated by the recognition that an implementation of their colliding-plasma scenario is unfolding at a cosmic scale several billion light years away. In this natural experiment, one cluster of galaxies—the Bullet Cluster—is moving away from another larger galaxy cluster after passing through it at high speed. The plasma components of each cluster are behaving as expected: They have slowed down because of electromagnetic interactions. But each cluster’s dark matter—the distribution of which astronomers infer through gravitational-lensing observations—appears to be affected by gravity alone. The absence of a measurable dark matter self-interaction means that any dark electromagnetism must be far weaker than its conventional counterpart. This, Schoeffler says, rules out many of the simplest models and could guide future direct-detection experiments.\n\n–Marric Stephens\n\nMarric Stephens is a Corresponding Editor for Physics Magazine based in Bristol, UK."}

Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nTraditional solar-powered path lights are some of the saddest home décor there is, their weak, dim beams suggesting that no one actually lives in the house they’re attempting to illuminate. These stick-and-go lights often seem forgotten by the homeowners that have jammed them into the earth, and who can blame them? The reality just doesn’t come close to matching the promise offered by the picture on the box.\n\nLinkind—whose interior smart bulb we recently covered—offers a tantalizing alternative: What if solar-powered path lights not only didn’t suck, but also included smart technology allowing for remote management?\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe Linkind Smart Solar Spotlight SL5C kit comes in a package of eight (a two-pack is also available) with a laminated solar panel on top of each housing. Two large banks of LEDs are inside each light, with a beam-focusing lens on its face. Note that these are directional spotlights, not ambient floods. Measuring about 6 x 3.5 inches, the IP65 water-resistant lights provide 3 watts of power, with their LEDs marketed as RGBTW—that’s red, green, blue, and tunable white.\n\nLinkind Smart Solar Spotlight SL5C are far brighter than your typical hardware store lights, and the colors are rich and lively.\n\nLinkind does not specify the wattage of the solar panel nor the size of the lights’ internal batteries, though the company says that when set to low-power mode (i.e., reduced brightness) they can run for up to 14 hours. (More on that in a bit.) They can be ground-mounted with plastic stakes or hung on a wall or other hard surface; hardware is included for either option. A simple thumbscrew allows you to adjust each light’s tilt angle.\n\nThe entire top surface of each Linkind Smart Solar Spotlight SL5C features a very efficient laminated solar panel. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nThe SL5C is an update to Linkind’s older model SL5 lights, which look almost identical. The main upgrade here is higher solar-charging efficiency; both in charging speed and when charging under different weather conditions. Note, however, that the motion-sensing feature from the SL5 model has been removed from the SL5C.\n\nSince these lights don’t need—and don’t accommodate—any power source other than solar, users are directed to place them in the sun for at least a full day before even turning them on. That’s done via a single button on the bottom of each device that not only powers the lights on and off, but that can be used to cycle the lights through a handful of primary colors and two white color temperatures. Anything more requires the AiDot mobile app (AiDot is Linkind’s parent company).\n\nConnectivity\n\nGiven the power limitations of the device, it’s understandable that its smart/wireless features are limited to Bluetooth mesh; as such, there’s not much to the setup process within the AiDot app. A quick discovery process turns up each lighting unit separately and drops you directly into color management and scheduling options once firmware has been brought up to date.\n\nThe Linkind Smart Solar Spotlight SL5C can glow in numerous colors or tunable white, and the batteries last a good long time given adequate sunshine during the day. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nThe lights support white color temperatures from a warm 2700K to a cool 6500K, or you can use a color wheel to dial in the specific hue of your choice from millions of options. Some 43 presets are included that enable various dynamic lighting modes, including a music-sync option that works with your phone’s microphone.\n\nLinkind all but forces you to use a scheduling system with the lights, either one that is strictly tied to the time of day or one that uses both time of day and ambient light level (“luminance detection”) to turn on and off. You need not use time restrictions with the latter if you want the lights to run all night but note that the lights are strictly designed to run in dark conditions. The only way to get the lights to operate during daylight is to cover the solar panel completely to emulate night.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe lights look good under the cloak of darkness. They are far brighter than your typical hardware store lights, and the colors are rich and lively. I found the dynamic modes to be a little flat—and the music mode is not very impressive—but if all you’re looking for is a pop of light after dark, these lights get the job done.\n\nBattery life is even better than promised. I started off running the lights for four hours each night at full brightness and regularly observed a fully charged battery by midday the following day. When running them without a time restriction, I managed to get more than 22 hours of running time at 100 percent brightness, far better than the 14 hours Linkind promises. While the battery meter indicator didn’t update reliably in the app, I didn’t encounter any real issues with the product.\n\nThe spotlights come with both a ground stake and a bracket for mounting to a wall or other hard surface. A pivot mechanism allows you to aim the light up or down. AiDot/Linkind\n\nWhat’s not to like here? The major problem with this setup is that each light must be managed individually, which means up to eight firmware updates, eight automation mode settings, and eight scheduling operations. On-demand color and dynamic modes can be set for “all lights” en masse, but you can’t do that for schedules.\n\nModes and schedules can, however, be “copied” from one light to another through a slightly buried menu item. You’ll also need to make sure you’re in Bluetooth range of each light when controlling it. This could present challenges if you’ve spread the lights over a long pathway, but once a schedule is configured to your liking, you can essentially set things up once and then forget about it.\n\nThe lights operate over Bluetooth mesh, so the AiDot app allows you to control each light individually or you can assign the same values to all of them at once. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nThere’s a workaround here in the form of the Linkind B1 Plus Hub, which I have not reviewed. It’s a Bluetooth bridge that lets you control up to 32 lights en masse from up to 120 feet from the bridge and the first spotlight. Each spotlight must likewise be no more than 120 feet apart, assuming there are no substantial obstructions between them.\n\nThat still won’t be enough distance for even moderately sized homesteads, but it’s at least a start. The hub also allows you to connect the lights to Alexa or Google Assistant, which can’t otherwise be done with the naked lights. The bridge was on sale for $30 at the time of this writing, not including an AC adapter.\n\nShould you buy the Linkind Smart Solar Spotlight SL5C?\n\nAn 8-pack of these second-gen landscape spotlights runs $130, while a 2-pack costs $35. (Limited-time launch discounts cut those prices to $91 and $25 respectively.) The larger bundle is a bit pricier than the older Linkind SL5 ($77 for a 6-pack), but it is still a very good deal, provided the slightly bulky design works for your aesthetic.\n\nWhile I would normally hesitate to recommend solar-powered lights to anyone, Linkind’s Solar Spotlights SL5C have me rethinking my position."}

The two are inseparable. While on this week’s episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, an introspective Coogler talked about how his new film “Sinners” was “a heart on the sleeve” endeavor, something he admitted to grappling with as he began a weeks-long publicity tour for the ambitious genre picture.\n\nThe origins of “Sinners” sprung from Coogler mourning the death of his beloved Uncle James, and the guilt he felt that, while shooting “Creed” in Philadelphia, his uncle was diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n\n“He would send me voice notes of encouragement when I was homesick and I’d want to go home,” said Coogler, who got visibly emotional discussing his uncle. “When I got into post-production on ‘Creed,’ which was in Los Angeles, I was at Wildfire Studios, and I got the call that he died. And I felt really guilty, because I got the call trying to picture lock this boxing movie, and I felt bad that I wasn’t home.”\n\nWhen Coogler was growing up, his parents couldn’t afford to buy a home in Oakland, so they settled in Richmond. Soon after, James and his family moved in down the street.\n\n“I was 11 years old in this new city, I had my uncle down the street and would go spend time with him [because] that was one of the few places my mom would let me walk in Richmond was to his house,” said Coogler, recalling afternoons and evenings filled with his uncle’s two great passions: San Francisco Giants baseball and blues music. “He would get off work and want to do is listen to old blues records, and drink Old Taylor whiskey. And I would just sit there with my uncle, who was the oldest man I knew, listening to stories about Mississippi, and talk to him about life and baseball.”\n\nCoogler admitted that, for most of his life, he thought of the blues as “old man music,” but that changed after his uncle’s death. “A mourning ritual for me, in a way [to] ease that feeling of guilt and loss, I would play these blues records,” said Coogler. “But, I would play them with a newfound perspective, and I would kind of conjure my uncle.”\n\n‘Sinners’ ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nCoogler would imagine his uncle’s Mississippi stories, which would only emerge when the elder gentleman sipped his whiskey and listening to the blues. Most of Coogler’s large extended family in the Bay Area are descendants of the Great Migration, a period between 1910 and 1970 when a mass movement of Black people left the South. Two prongs of his family tree, represented by James and his maternal grandfather (who died before he was born), had come from Mississippi.\n\nMost reviews and articles about “Sinners,” set in 1932 Mississippi and featuring some nefarious vampires descending on a local juke joint owned by brothers Smoke and Stack (Michael B. Jordan), mention how it is also an exploration of why many, like Coogler’s uncle and grandfather, fled Mississippi. That aspect is certainly present in the film — “Sinners” doesn’t shy away from the hardships of cotton-picking, Klan-invested, rural Mississippi. But that wasn’t at the soul of his uncle’s stories, nor was it what was on Coogler’s mind as his mourning ritual morphed into his new artistic undertaking.\n\n“[‘Sinners’] is also about why some people chose to stay. To understand the Great Migration is to also understand for a long time our people’s home was the South. To migrate means to leave something behind,” said Coogler. “Very often, and rightfully so, that part of time and that physical location in the United States, is a place that’s associated with a lot of pain, a lot of shame, a lot of discomfort, but to completely look away from it is to not look at what else was there. The resilience, the brilliance, the fortitude, and also the art, the artistic wonder, the cultural wonder.”\n\nIt’s a spirit that resides in the blues music of that era, and it was that aspect of history Coogler would imagine as he conjured his uncle and his stories of the South. His imagination eventually leading him to the fictional story of Smoke and Stack who, after surviving the trauma of World War I and gangland Chicago during Prohibition, return home to Mississippi to start a juke joint — a refuge of culture, food, dancing, and (most of all) blues music.\n\nOnce he decided to pursue “Sinners” as his next film following “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” Coogler and his long-time collaborator composer Ludwig Göransson went on a tour of the roots of Delta Blues music, an exploration that changed the trajectory of the film.\n\n“I found that there’s a legitimate argument to be made that the Delta Blues music is America’s most important contribution to global popular culture. It might be America’s most important artistic contribution to humanity came out of this place, and that’s when I realized that the film had to be epic,” said Coogler. “At first I thought [‘Sinners’ was] going to be a small genre film, but [the more] I learned I was like, ‘Oh, this thing has to actually be massive’ for it to feel right, to do it justice. It was an astonishing discovery for me. You’re talking to somebody who went back to the continent of Africa to connect with his ancestors [with the two ‘Blank Panther’ films], but I skipped over the American South. I hadn’t been to Mississippi, I hadn’t been to Port Arthur [the small town outside Houston, Texas, where Coogler’s grandmother is from], I hadn’t been to these places where my family just worked.”\n\nNot only did Coogler hear the music and see the history differently, he stopped seeing his beloved grandmother and uncle as old people. Their stories were no longer two generations removed, but present.\n\nCoogler told IndieWire, “One of the most powerful things about my community is that it is a trans-generational one,” discussing how, while writing, he could just pick up the phone and call his 93-year-old father-in-law in Chicago, who also came from Mississippi, to ask questions. Coogler credits asking his grandmother about her first date with his grandfather (the one from Mississippi) as an important turning point of how he saw the film — her story of going to a movie reminding the writer/director of first date with Zinzi, his now-wife and producing partner, at the Regal Jack London Theater in Oakland to see “Bring It On.”\n\n“[My grandmother] said, ‘Well, I had trouble watching the movie because he kept trying to make out with me.’ And she said, ‘Eventually, I told him, ‘Look, we can do that after, I’m trying to see this movie,’” Coogler said with a laugh. “And me imagining my grandmother saying that, it made me realize the youthful nature of these people, their virility and vitality.”\n\nThat his grandparents’ first date was at also at an Oakland movie theater felt like a cosmic connection to Coogler that influenced how he saw what would be his first period film: “Sinners” maybe set in historical 1932, but every decision he and his collaborators would make — from the use of color, to shooting in IMAX — would make the past feel alive and present.\n\nThe timelessness and vitality with which Coogler was seeing his story and characters needed to play like now for audiences. It’s a vision best represented in a musical sequence that comes at the film’s mid-point, which Coogler and his collaborator would refer to as the “the surreal montage” — a moment of musical euphoria at Smoke and Stack’s juke joint, a live blues performance that conjures the spirit of Black musicians past and present, from West African drumming to funkadelic and hip hop.\n\n“It all started with the fact that I would listen to that blues music to think about my uncle, and I thought, ‘Man, who was he thinking about when he was listening to it?’ Did he listen to that [music] and was it people that he was conjuring?,” said Coogler of the inspiration for what is destined to be the most discussed sequence in his film. “[It’s about] that feeling of being at a live performance of any art, it could be a stage play or it could be a really good movie, but usually it’s music, and when you see a virtouso perform and you’re in the presence of a group of people who also appreciate the art form, but also know the context of it and know where the artist is coming from, they relate to what’s being portrayed, and the feeling of euphoria becomes like a storm system. It’s feedback happening and rippling. I’ve had a few of those moments [in my life], and you feel immortal, like you are outside of space and time for [a moment], like there’s another presence there with you.”\n\nIt’s an example of how listening to blues to conjure his uncle turned into pure cinematic creation. Throughout writing, Coogler would also imagine conversing with James and his uncle’s two sons, creating moments in the film that would entertain each, but that also sounded like them.\n\nMichael B. Jordan as Smoke and Stack in ‘Sinners’ ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n“I would play blues music and I would kind of talk to my cousins, both of [James’] sons who passed away, there’s a lot of Smoke and Stack in my Uncle Rod and my Uncle Mark. I would talk to them, I would say, ‘Man, wouldn’t they get a kick outta this?’ When I would write Stack’s lines, I was like, ‘Oh, yeah, my Uncle Mark would say something crazy like this,’” said Coogler. “And when I got done, I said, ‘Oh, man, wait a minute, Uncle James, wouldn’t you get a kick out of Buddy Guy [being] in a movie?’”\n\nEighty-eight year old blues legend Buddy Guy was James’ favorite musician. Coogler remembered his uncle getting dressed up to go see Guy whenever he played in California. And when he became older, and could no longer drive himself, Coogler’s mom or cousins would get dressed up to take him to see the musician perform.\n\nThe baseball-obsessed, blue-listening James didn’t go to movies — Coogler speculated his 2013 “Fruitvale Station” premiere was his uncle’s first 30 years. Coogler so associated Guy with his uncle, he assumed movies would not be the blues legend’s thing as well, and he stood little chance of getting him to play a small, but significant role in “Sinners.” When casting director Francine Maisler set up a meeting for Coogler at Guy’s Chicago club, Legends, the nervous director had his pitch prepared, but was braced for a quick, polite “no.”\n\n“I went in there and he had all his grandkids and his kids in there, he was surrounded by family,” said Coogler, who would discover the younger generation of Guy’s family were, not surprisingly, “Black Panther” fans. “And they’re looking at me smiling, and I wasn’t prepared for this, [Guy] says, before I could tell him anything, ‘Hey, my grandkids tell me I should talk to you, and the way they talk about you, I figure whatever you want me to do, I’m in.’ I was like, ‘Can I at least tell you what the movie is about?’ and he’s like, ‘Sure.’”\n\nTo say much about Guy’s role in the film would be a spoiler, but the use of his presence goes well beyond cameo and becomes a deeply meaningful thruline connecting the supernatural story and music and characters and history with the now. Seeing the film, it is hard to imagine “Sinners” without the blues legend, but knowing the original creative spark stemmed from Coogler’s simple desire to entertain his deceased uncle is also a full-circle moment in the creation of the writer/director’s most personal and ambitious project to date.\n\nWarner Bros. will release “Sinners” in theaters on Friday, April 18.\n\nTo hear Ryan Coogler’s full interview, subscribe to the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast on Apple, Spotify, or your favorite podcast platform.

The debate, held in French in Quebec, exposed vulnerabilities in Carney’s messaging and language skills as his opponents challenged the Liberal government’s economic track record and fiscal promises.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh both accused Carney of repackaging policies from the former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government. “You were Justin Trudeau’s adviser — have you forgotten that?” Poilievre said, after Carney repeated the line, “I just got here.”\n\nCarney defended his early record as prime minister and previewed a $500 billion investment plan over five years, aimed at sectors like housing and green infrastructure. When asked how it would be funded, he cited “catalyzing private investment” through demand-generating measures such as GST cuts on some homes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet dismissed Carney’s fiscal claims as fantasy, calling it a “Harry Potter budget.” Singh echoed Blanchet’s skepticism, saying, “You’re promising magic, Mr. Carney,” as the three opposition leaders questioned whether Ottawa could afford tax cuts alongside major spending.\n\nHousing emerged as a flashpoint, with Carney promising funding for affordable development and Poilievre accusing him of copying failed Liberal policies. The Conservative leader pledged to accelerate homebuilding by reducing permitting delays, declaring, “We don’t need more bureaucrats. We need more doors for families.”\n\nSingh fired back at Poilievre over his past tenure as housing minister, claiming only six homes were built during that period—a figure Poilievre strongly disputed, insisting the true number was 200,000. Blanchet, meanwhile, emphasized prioritizing local infrastructure projects, including the Quebec City tramway and a Montreal hospital.\n\nNotably, none of the major parties have released full election platforms, a point raised several times throughout the evening. Carney pledged to release the Liberal platform by Monday, while Poilievre promised his own plan “in a few days.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe leaders are set to meet again in an English-language debate tonight, where Carney, who retains a near-seven-point advantage in recent polls, will face continued scrutiny over policy specifics and his tenure in both domestic and international roles.\n\nRelated articles\n\nCarney targeted in French debate as rivals question Liberal record\n\nPoilievre promises crackdown on scams, knocks Carney\n\nCarney unveils training plan, tackles auto sector woes"}

Where will they take their children to experience natural wonders, discover their heritage, or learn about their country?\n\nOne of the go-to resources is the National Park Service website.\n\nSadly, parents will find that the National Park Service continues to promote gender ideology and the work of substantially discredited sex researcher Alfred Kinsey.\n\nElevating Kinsey\n\nA National Park Service article, “Expressions as Diverse as the Landscape: Kinsey Institute, Bloomington, IN,” lauds Kinsey’s work, contending that he “conducted pioneering research to challenge ideas of normativity and discriminatory laws regarding sexual behavior” and that he contributed to a “heterosexual-homosexual rating scale, placing the sexual behavior of individuals along a continuum.”?\n\nIn 1948, Alfred Kinsey published “Sexual Behavior in the Human Male.” The infamous tables in the book were drawn from data that was scientifically and morally perverse, involving the molestation of 317 boys, beginning at the age of two months.\n\nAccording to a colleague, in his experiments, Kinsey would “listen only to pedophiles who were very careful, used stopwatches, knew how to record their thing.”\n\nThis is what our National Parks are holding up as deserving of praise and remembrance.\n\nA series highlighting historical LGBTQ+ sites\n\nThe Kinsey article is part of a series first released in 2016 by the National Park Service’s Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education entitled, “Finding Our Place: LGB Heritage in the United States” highlighting the history of LGBTQ+ communities.\n\nEach of the 25 articles in the series points to places, like “gayborhoods,” monuments, or buildings, and explains its significance for LGBTQ+ history. While the sites on the list are not to be equated with the Kinsey Institute, the entire project goes beyond the mission of the National Park Service as a federal entity.\n\nThat is because the whole series is unapologetically activist. By celebrating “diverse gender expression” or medical treatments performed “based on a patient’s own gender identity,” the National Park Service is encouraging Americans to adopt a form of gender ideology aimed at challenging “ideas of normativity” (like there are only two sexes).\n\nThis kind of political activism is a departure from the common sense mandate of the National Park Service to protect and preserve places like Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park.\n\nFrom Native American gender expression to sex-change surgeons\n\nUltimately, gender ideology subverts the principle “all men are created equal,” which sets bounds to human behavior, to not only make all actions, including the work of Kinsey, acceptable, but falsely consistent with that principle and worthy of celebration. What would America become if that were to happen??\n\nTo give a few more examples from the series:\n\n“Gender and Sexuality in Native America: Many People, Many Meanings” contends that, “Research indicates well over 100 instances of diverse gender expression in Native American tribes at the time of early European contact. The cultural legacy of these people was nearly erased by religious indoctrination and the imposition of laws criminalizing varied sexuality and gender expression.”\n\n“LGB Activism: The Henry Gerber House, Chicago, IL,” asserts that Henry Gerber, founder of the first gay rights organization in the U.S., “melded his experiences with the German homophile movement with the American ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence.” The last line of the article notes that, “In 2015, the Henry Gerber House became the nation’s second National Historic Landmark designated for its association with LGB history.”\n\nThe Selling Building (which was added to the National Register in 1991 for its historic and architectural significance) was also home to psychologist J. Allen Gilbert. Dr. Gilbert performed a hysterectomy on his patient, perhaps “the first time in U.S. history that a psychologist supported such a procedure based on the patient’s own gender identity.”\n\nBetraying the mission of the National Park Service\n\nThe series of articles, “Finding Our Place: LGB Heritage in the United States” aims to alter the criteria of what makes a historic site significant and worth the preservation of the National Park Service. They distort the history of places like the Kinsey Institute, lauding as progress research of the most contemptible and immoral nature, an endeavor that not only undermines American history but the most fundamental of human sentiments.\n\nNone of this is in keeping with the mission of the National Park Service or befitting of the American national character."}

Last fall, Mahdawi began weekly meetings with Israeli students to discuss their upbringing and beliefs about the long-simmering Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the associates said.\n\n“ Meeting Mohsen reminded me that the cause of peace is a cause worth fighting for,” said Mikey Baratz, 31, a Jewish Israeli who graduated from the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs in December and said he participated in Mahdawi’s weekly meetings.\n\nThe portrait of Mahdawi described by his associates contrasts starkly with Trump administration officials' portrayals of pro-Palestinian activists as purveyors of antisemitism and hate who merit deportation.\n\nICE agents took Mahdawi, who has been a lawful permanent U.S. resident for 10 years, into custody when he went for a naturalization interview in Vermont, where he has a permanent residence, according to his attorneys.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has not responded to a request for comment about Mahdawi’s arrest. An ICE spokesperson referred questions to the office of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose spokespeople have not responded.\n\nBut a memo from Rubio states that the Trump administration is seeking to deport Mahdawi because his activities could “potentially undermine” the Middle East peace process, the New York Times reported.\n\nMahdawi is the latest of several college students targeted by the Trump administration on grounds that their pro-Palestinian activism could cause harm, the first being Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate and protest leader who has been held in ICE detention in Louisiana since March 8. Hundreds of international college students across the country have had their visas revoked, and the Trump administration has pulled billions of dollars in grant funding for universities it claims have failed to properly address antisemitism on campus.\n\nA federal judge has ordered that Mahdawi can’t be deported or moved out of Vermont, for now. A hearing will take place in his federal lawsuit on Wednesday.\n\nComing to America and Columbia\n\nMahdawi was born and raised in the Far'a refugee camp in the West Bank, where his family currently resides and where his grandparents fled in the prior generation, according to court documents and a lecture Mahdawi gave to a class in Santa Barbara, California, in March 2024.\n\nMahdawi said he suffered a series of traumas as a child. When he was 7 years old, his mother left. The next year, his 6-year-old brother died after suffering paralysis. When Mahdawi was 10 years old, he said at a November 2023 protest, he saw his best friend Hemida shot by Israeli soldiers.\n\nWhen he was 11, Mahdawi said, he witnessed his uncle Thayer being fatally shot in the head and shoulder. When he was 17, Mahdawi said, two cousins were killed in a refugee camp in Jenin, also in the West Bank. And Mahdawi said he has a scar where he was shot in the leg by an Israeli soldier at 15 years old.\n\nAs other young Palestinian men were opting for more militant tactics, his uncle encouraged him to pursue education, Mahdawi said at his 2024 lecture in Santa Barbara. He enrolled in Birzeit University, in the West Bank two hours from camp, to study computer science and engineering. Outside of class one day, he met a woman who eventually became his wife and inspired him to come to the United States, he said.\n\nMahdawi settled in Vermont, and later separated from his wife. In 2018, he enrolled in Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, where he studied computer science for two years before transferring to Columbia in 2021 to study philosophy, according to court documents.\n\nPro-Palestinian activism\n\nSeveral pro-Palestinian protests erupted on campus in the fall of 2023, in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks, and during Israel’s siege in Gaza. Mahdawi quickly emerged as a regular speaker holding a megaphone at those rallies and protests.\n\nAround the same time, Mahdawi co-founded a cultural group for Palestinian students, called “Dar,” with Mahmoud Khalil, according to court documents.\n\nIn November 2023, Mahdawi publicly denounced an individual spewing antisemitic remarks during a pro-Palestinian rally on campus, the Columbia Spectator, the university’s student newspaper, reported in its coverage.\n\nThe individual shouted “Death to Jews,” Mahdawi said in a December 2023 interview with 60 Minutes, an appearance that further elevated his profile. In response, Mahdawi grabbed a megaphone and said, “Shame on the person who called (for) ‘death to Jews,’” according to the Spectator report, sparking chants among the crowd of “shame on you.”\n\nIn another pro-Palestinian rally, in November of 2023, Mahdawi denounced Israel’s siege on Gaza, saying “ Today we see the images of people in Gaza. Images that shock the consciousness of every human, images that shock your own consciousness. And we come here in solidarity with Gaza and the Gazan people against oppression, against genocide.”\n\nHe repeatedly chanted a quotation by Martin Luther King Jr. that his friends said he often recites: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”\n\nMahdawi’s classmates said they were at times surprised by his deep commitment to nonviolence and peace, after being exposed to so much violence in his youth.\n\nAharon Dardik, 24, a Columbia student, said he and Mahdawi co-wrote a 65-page paper that they hoped would be a rubric for a comprehensive peace plan for Israelis and Palestinians abroad.\n\nThe plan suggested the territories begin with a structure similar to a “two-state solution,” then transitioning to a confederacy, before merging as a single Democratic state, Dardik said.\n\nDardik called Mahdawi “one of the greatest peace activists I’ve ever met.”\n\n“He lives his life with a dedication to that mission of showing love for everyone, even the people who hurt him, even the people who hate him,” Dardik said.\n\nMahdawi also became a target of pro-Israel groups that seek to reveal the identities of pro-Palestinian student protesters and condemn actions they label as antisemitic.\n\nCanary Mission, a pro-Israel group that publicly posts information online about students they consider to be pro-Hamas, created an extensive profile of Mahdawi, with screenshots, videos, links to articles, and quotes from his speeches and interviews.\n\nIn one video posted by Canary Mission, purported from a November 2023 speech, Mahdawi said, “We were accused by the administration that we are calling for genocide, while the administration itself is ignoring the current genocide that is taking place in Gaza. Shame on you, Columbia!”\n\nMahdawi also became a target of the pro-Israel group Betar US, which has called for the deportation of certain pro-Palestinian students. In January of 2025, Betar warned that Mahdawi “is on our deport list.”\n\nCanary Mission did not respond to a request for comment and Betar US declined comment.\n\n'It made me a little hopeful'\n\nBut those close to Mahdawi said his was a calming voice during a time of great strife and division at Columbia.\n\n“ He's someone who approaches every single conversation thoughtfully and in a spirit of openness and listening,” said Joseph Howley, a Columbia classics professor who met Mahdawi through their activism work.\n\nHowley added, “He's just always thinking about how do you bring people together.”\n\nMahdawi was also a convener of different groups, often hosting intimate dialogues about people’s personal histories, according to Howley and his classmates. He was also president of the Columbia University Buddhist Association for two years, according to court records.\n\nSahar Bostock, 36, a Jewish Israeli history doctoral student, said she was struck by Mahdawi’s decision to host weekly discussion sessions with Israeli students — a choice she thought was courageous during Israel’s siege in Gaza.\n\n“It made me a little hopeful, despite everything that’s going on,” Bostock said.\n\nIn the wake of Mahdawi’s arrest, students and professors have come forward with public letters condemning his detention. The Columbia philosophy department, in a statement posted on the department’s website, called upon the university's acting president to assist any Columbia student being targeted or detained for their activism. A supportive open letter “from a group of Israeli citizens in the U.S.” circulates on his behalf as well.\n\nAs Mahdawi prepared for his citizenship interview last Monday, he knew it might be a trap, according to classmates and friends. He alerted Vermont State Sen. Becca White, who represents the area where Mahdawi lives, and she said she alerted members of Congress about Mahdawi’s case.\n\nBefore the citizenship meeting, White said, Mahdawi gathered with a group of friends and his lawyer for coffee, and they quizzed him on the Constitution, in hopes the citizenship appointment was real.\n\nWhite said Mahdawi remained calm in the moments before, as ICE agents intervened. A video shows him being escorted to a car and flashing peace signs as he is whisked away.\n\nRamsey Khalifeh contributed reporting.\n\nThis article was updated with additional information."}

The strawberry burger cookie sandwich set will go on sale on April 18 at the Captain Sweets Burger shop, which can be found on the first-floor south walkway inside of the ticket gates near the Marunouchi South Exit.\n\nEach strawberry burger consists of two soft butter cookies decorated with Kirby’s face that form a sandwich around a double dose of strawberry flavor–first, a dollop of bittersweet strawberry-flavored whipped chocolate, and second, an oversized slab of strawberry milk-flavored chocolate. We think Kirby himself would be delighted with this combination and would inhale one of them in the blink of an eye!\n\nFurthermore, the six-piece set comes packaged in an adorable, exclusive box featuring both Kirby and Waddle Dee.

It’ll really get their stomachs growling, though, if it’s chocolate from an exalted specialty chocolatier you’re talking about, like, for instance, Godiva.\n\nLikewise, mentioning “matcha” will grab the attention of dessert enthusiasts in Japan, but even more so if the topic of discussion is Uji matcha, green tea grown and harvested in the Kyoto Prefecture town of Uji, widely regarded as the finest matcha-producing region in all of Japan. Similarly, ishiusubiki matcha, stone-ground matcha powdered with the use of an old-fashioned millstone, is considered a cut above regular green tea.\n\nSo when you combine all of those and make a Godiva stone-ground uji matcha chocolate beverage, well, it’s definitely going on a lot of people’s must-drink list.\n\nComing to Godiva Japan branches later this month is the Stone-ground Uji Matcha Chocolixir. While this isn’t the first time for Godiva to serve up a matcha-flavored version of its flagship dessert drink, this is a new recipe that’s making its debut. Godiva promises that the stone-milling makes the green tea powder even more fragrant and flavorful, allowing the enticing mix of inviting bitterness and other flavors of the matcha to dance on your taste buds. Accompanying them is milky white chocolate, which is less likely to cover up the tea notes than milk or dark chocolate are. The topping swirl of mixed cream also has matcha powder and matcha syrup poured over it, because you don’t order a Stone-ground Uji Matcha Chocolixir is you’re only in the mood for a little matcha.\n\nThe new green tea drink is part of Godiva Japan’s celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Chocolixir’s arrival in Japan, and will be priced at 860 yen (US$5.75) for a medium and 970 ten for a large, a price differential that’s sure to have many people deciding to just go for the large when the Stone-ground Uji Matcha Chocolixir goes on sale April 25.\n\nSource: PR Times, Godiva Japan\n\nImages: PR Times\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

If you’re considering this update, it’s essential to weigh the drawbacks against the limited benefits. With noticeable performance declines, persistent bugs, and no significant new features, sticking with iOS 18.4 remains the more practical choice for most users. The video below from iReviews gives us more details.\n\nKey Details About the Update\n\nThe size of the iOS 18.5 Beta 2 update varies depending on your current version:\n\nUpdating from Beta 1: Approximately 500MB.\n\nApproximately 500MB. Updating from iOS 18.4: Around 800MB.\n\nAround 800MB. Updating from older versions: Up to 7GB.\n\nThe build number for this beta, 22F5053F, suggests that Apple is still refining the update, with additional beta versions expected before the public release. The final version is anticipated to arrive in mid-May, giving Apple time to address existing issues and improve stability.\n\nNew Features and Adjustments\n\niOS 18.5 Beta 2 introduces a few minor updates to native apps, but these changes are unlikely to significantly impact your overall experience:\n\nMail App: A new “All Emails” button has been added, making navigation slightly more convenient.\n\nA new “All Emails” button has been added, making navigation slightly more convenient. News App: A new “Food” section has been introduced, accompanied by a splash screen explaining its features.\n\nA new “Food” section has been introduced, accompanied by a splash screen explaining its features. Photos App: The “Recover All” and “Delete All” buttons for recently deleted photos, which were reintroduced in Beta 1, have been removed again.\n\nWhile these updates add minor functionality, they fail to deliver substantial improvements or address broader user needs. For most users, these changes are unlikely to justify the potential downsides of updating.\n\nPerformance Concerns\n\nPerformance benchmarks for iOS 18.5 Beta 2 indicate a slight decline compared to earlier versions, raising concerns about its impact on daily use. Geekbench scores reveal:\n\nSingle-core performance: 2,922, reflecting a minor drop.\n\n2,922, reflecting a minor drop. Multi-core performance: 7,233, approximately 200 points lower than iOS 18.4.\n\nThis reduction in performance, particularly in multi-tasking scenarios, could affect users who rely on their devices for demanding tasks. The decline is especially noticeable on older devices, where hardware limitations amplify the impact of software inefficiencies.\n\nBattery Life Challenges\n\nBattery performance has also been negatively affected in this beta. On an iPhone 15 Pro Max with 91% battery health, users report shorter battery life compared to iOS 18.4. The issue is even more pronounced on older devices, where battery degradation compounds the problem. For users who prioritize battery longevity, this update may not be a reliable choice.\n\nUnresolved Bugs and Persistent Issues\n\nSeveral bugs from Beta 1 remain unresolved in Beta 2, further diminishing its appeal. Notable issues include:\n\nIntermittent freezing: The app library occasionally freezes, disrupting navigation.\n\nThe app library occasionally freezes, disrupting navigation. Icon-switching glitches: These glitches affect the user interface, creating a less seamless experience.\n\nThese persistent problems, combined with the performance and battery concerns, make this beta less suitable for everyday use. Users seeking a stable and reliable experience may find these issues particularly frustrating.\n\nFuture Updates and What to Expect\n\nApple is expected to release iOS 18.4.1 in the coming weeks as a minor bug-fix update. This version will bypass beta testing and likely address some of the issues present in iOS 18.4. Meanwhile, iOS 18.5 Beta 3 is anticipated around April 21, with weekly updates leading up to the public release. Looking further ahead, iOS 19 Beta is set to debut on June 9 during WWDC 2025, offering a preview of the next major iteration of the operating system.\n\nShould You Update?\n\nGiven the lack of meaningful improvements and the ongoing performance and battery issues, it’s advisable to remain on iOS 18.4 for now. The current beta doesn’t provide enough value to outweigh the potential drawbacks. Waiting for future updates or the stable release of iOS 18.5 will likely deliver a more reliable and polished experience. For users who prioritize stability, performance, and battery life, holding off on this update is the most prudent decision.\n\nUncover more insights about iOS 18.5 in previous articles we have written.\n\nSource & Image Credit: iReviews\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.
