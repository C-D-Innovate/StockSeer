Rather, it may have been transported on a Martian river or lake to its current position, billions of years ago. However, many questions still remain about the rock's origin and what it can tell us about the history of our cosmic neighbor.\n\nNew color discovered\n\nIn a study, scientists used a new way of displaying color imagery to push the boundaries of human vision. (Image credit: blackdovfx via Getty Images)\n\nA whole new dimension of vision could be just around the corner after scientists successfully hijacked the human eye to see a brand-new color called olo.\n\nThe color, described by study participants as a \"blue-green of unprecedented saturation,\" was made visible using a technique called \"Oz\" to stimulate a particular group of light receptors at the back of the participants' eyes.\n\nThe researchers say their method could be developed to restore color vision in those with color blindness, and that it could potentially provide enhanced digital viewing experiences in the future.\n\nDiscover more health news\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

(Image credit: zsv3207 via Getty Images)\n\nIf you have an outdoor cat, you've probably been presented with \"gifts\" from your furry companion — usually in the form of dead birds and rodents. But have you ever wondered why they do this?\n\nYour cat had to use a lot of energy to capture this prize, so eating it themselves would be the most sensible action from a survival perspective. But experts say there are several hypotheses for why they continue this bizarre behavior.\n\nFirst quantum operating system\n\nThe new operating system is the first in the world that allows quantum computers with different kinds of qubits to function together in a single network. (Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nScientists have made steps towards a quantum internet after developing the world's first operating system to facilitate connections between quantum computers.\n\nOperating systems, like Microsoft Windows and Apple iOS, manage and control our computers' hardware and software. They enable users to interact with applications and allow different devices to connect with each other.\n\nMost existing quantum computers are designed and built to carry out a specific function and use different kinds of quantum bits (qubits) to run their calculations. But now, a first-of-its-kind quantum operating system called QNodeOS has been developed to allow multiple quantum computers to connect and be controlled by a single central platform, regardless of the type of qubits they use.\n\nDiscover more technology news\n\n—Schrödinger's cat-inspired quantum computing now 160 times more reliable thanks to new discovery\n\n—Dyson spheres could really exist — but there's a catch\n\n—'Beauty' particle discovered at world's largest atom smasher could unlock new physics\n\nAlso in science news this week\n\n—Solar wind might be making water on the moon, groundbreaking NASA study reveals\n\n—Giant 'sea dragon' fossil could be largest mosasaur ever discovered in Mississippi\n\n—Parasitic worm raises risk of cervical cancer, study finds\n\n—Lion mauled gladiator to death 1,800 years ago in Roman Britain, controversial study suggests\n\nScience Spotlight\n\nAtlantic ocean currents regulate the climate, and they may be weakening, emerging research suggests. (Image credit: Nicholas Forder)\n\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, also known as the AMOC, is a large system of ocean currents that brings warm water from the tropics northwards and ferries colder water from north to south.\n\nThe system, which acts like an enormous watery conveyor belt, ensures that the oceans are continually mixed and that heat is distributed around the planet. However, a mysterious \"blob\" of water in the North Atlantic that has puzzled scientists for decades could be an ominous signal that these essential currents are slowing down.

But not just any property will do. Griffin is apparently drawn to real estate deals involving hefty price tags.\n\nHis recent purchases could shed light on where the moneyed set might turn for their future real estate finds. Markets with the “Griffin bump” could be perceived as desirable if such a big investor is buying there.\n\nHowever, that is assuming he’s not the only person in town snatching up $100 million homes—a danger cited in a recent Wall Street Journal article about Griffin’s burgeoning real estate empire and his effect on the luxury real estate market. Nonetheless, Griffin is known as one of the most prolific buyers of retail-price real estate.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith that in mind, we decided to take a closer look at some of his recent acquisitions to see how they stack up in profit, loss, or pleasure potential.\n\n1. Palm Beach, FL\n\nWhile still under construction, this is one epic mansion in the making. If Griffin follows through with his reported plans to build a $150 million–$400 million house on 8 of the 27 acres of prime Palm Beach property he purchased in 2023, it will be one of the priciest homes on the planet, coming in at an estimated $1 billion upon completion.\n\nUpon completion, this Palm Beach, FL, property will be one of the most expensive homes in the world. (Stoev Design Group, Courtesy of Town of Palm Beach)\n\nLocated on South Ocean Boulevard in an area known as “Billionaires Row,” the dwelling-in-progress will first serve as the residence for Griffin’s mother. At a projected 50,000 square feet, the waterfront property has both ocean and lake views, as well as a spa, pool, and abundant gardens.\n\nA rendering of the main room of Griffin’s Palm Beach estate\n\nWith such an outlay of funds, could this property ever appreciate? That remains to be seen, but that also might not be the point of Griffin’s purchases.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Anyone who aims to build the most expensive property in the world isn’t focused on the investment side,” says luxury real estate broker Samantha DeBianchi, of Bravo TV’s “Million Dollar Listing” fame. “Palm Beach is an elite area of the ‘who’s who’ and home to some of the most spectacular properties in the world—and naturally, Ken wants his property to be the centerpiece.”\n\nThat being said, DeBianchi says Palm Beach has appreciated an incredible amount just in the past five years.\n\n“There’s been a migration from New York and California to areas like Palm Beach, and while I don’t necessarily feel California and New York have soured for billionaires, there has been a strong rise in interest and more overall demand and attention in markets like Palm Beach, Miami, etc.—and that’s something we didn’t see and hear about as much prior to COVID.”\n\nThe bottom line: While it seems that Griffin’s Palm Beach build is not necessarily for investment purposes, it also doesn’t hurt that it’s in one of today’s most coveted and exclusive U.S. markets.\n\n2. New York, NY\n\nSpeaking of billionaires, it would seem that Griffin likes to live in buildings or areas that show he’s “one of them.” In New York City, being “a part of it” means owning an apartment on Manhattan’s Billionaires Row—a cluster of ultraluxe skyscrapers and condos in the area around Columbus Circle, 57th Street, Central Park South, and Park Avenue.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith his $238 million condo deal for a quadplex spanning floors 50 to 53 at 220 Central Park South, Griffin took the record in 2019 for the highest-priced home ever purchased in the U.S. He’s since added two adjacent units on the 20th floor—presumably for guests or staff—bringing his total holdings in this building designed by “starchitect” Robert A.M. Stern to nearly $244 million.\n\nThis skyscraper at 220 Central Park South houses some of the priciest condos on Manhattan’s Billionaires Row. (Realtor.com/Nest Seekers International, Midtown)\n\nThat 24,000-square-foot acquisition not only cemented Griffin as part of Manhattan’s billionaires club, it also gave him Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, as neighbors in the same building.\n\nAs if that weren’t enough, Griffin just purchased another New York City co-op at 740 Park Ave., according to the Wall Street Journal. In February 2025, he picked up the duplex for $45 million from Julia Koch, widow of billionaire industrialist David Koch, in what is known as Manhattan’s top co-op building. (Manhattan’s top condo, which is 220 Central Park South, is already part of Griffin’s real estate portfolio.)\n\nSo, is this potentially a good investment?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Billionaires are drawn to markets like New York for a mix of financial, lifestyle, and strategic reasons,” says Scott Bennett, head of specialty asset management for Wells Fargo. “Prime real estate in these locations can also be seen as a safe haven for capital preservation.”\n\nIn other words, Griffin isn’t likely to lose money by buying big in the Big Apple.\n\n3. Chicago, IL\n\nFor nearly three decades, Griffin’s Citadel hedge fund offices were based in Chicago. As such, Griffin has held some impressive properties in his Windy City portfolio.\n\nAmong his holdings were four full-floor units in the downtown No. 9 Walton condo tower, which included both top penthouses on the 38th and 39th floors. At the time of their purchase in 2017 for $58.78 million, Griffin set another record for the city’s highest real estate transaction.\n\nFor years, No. 9 Walton symbolized ultraluxe living in Chicago. (Realtor.com/Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty)\n\nHowever, Griffin seems to have soured on Chicago living. Recently, he effectuated one of the few real estate transactions in which he took a hefty hit, selling the penthouse floors of No. 9 Walton for $19 million—a 44% loss from the $34 million he paid for those two units in 2017. He sold two additional floors in April 2025 for $15.9 million, marking an $8.1 million loss.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGriffin also unloaded his 37th-floor, five-bedroom, 7,400-square-foot Chicago Waldorf Astoria residence for $10.2 million in 2022, which was about a $3 million loss. His willingness to let go of these properties at a deficit seems to cement his desire for an Illinois exit.\n\nThe Chicago area has been experiencing a massive slowdown in the ultraluxury real estate market, according to the Journal. But some of the high-stakes players are still holding steady.\n\nCase in point? In a twist of real estate fate, the buyer of Griffin’s No. 9 Walton penthouses was none other than Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker—with whom Griffin has apparently had a long-standing feud.\n\nThe reality is that Griffin took a loss in Chicago primarily due to his desire to sell. For him, that was a greater impetus than profit. Also, losing a few million dollars won’t make a dent in his overall portfolio.\n\n4. Miami, FL\n\nIn 2022, Griffin moved Citadel’s headquarters to Miami, and that’s led to him reinvesting his Chicago sales into Sunshine State real estate.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNot only is Griffin building a 54-story glass tower office building in downtown Miami—which will include two restaurants and a rooftop hotel—but he’s also snapping up real estate for himself.\n\nA little farther south of downtown, in the Miami-Dade area, Griffin set another area purchase record when he picked up two bay-front houses in Coconut Grove, FL, for $106.9 million in 2022. That’s an additional 25,000 square feet of Florida living space (just a casual 12 bedrooms).\n\nThen there’s the seven contiguous properties (about 6.5 acres) Griffin acquired on Miami’s exclusive Star Island, dropping approximately $169 million over several transactions since 2023.\n\nGriffin’s spokesperson Zia Ahmed told the Journal recently that Griffin mostly purchases “one-of-a-kind properties and oceanfront lots that are inherently of limited supply and therefore likely to keep increasing in value,” but he also targets areas where he travels for work and that will serve as homes for him and his family for years to come.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith longevity in mind, potential climate change might be something to consider when it comes to safeguarding his investments.\n\n“Climate change is real, but billionaires are more focused on the ‘now’ than the future,” says DeBianchi. “With that said, because people are more educated on climate change, they are building their properties stronger than before—constructing at higher elevations, raising seawalls, and incorporating better drainage systems.”\n\nIn fact, the Palm Beach Daily News reports that Griffin is planning to replace the groins—structures that jut out from the beach that trap sand and prevent erosion—in front of his billion-dollar property that’s under construction, so he might be keeping an eye on preserving his investments as well as enjoying them.\n\n“When you’re spending millions of dollars just on land, you’re also going to spend heavily on the right infrastructure and protection for whatever you decide to build,” says DeBianchi.\n\n5. Saint-Tropez, Aspen, and the Hamptons\n\nWhile many of Griffin’s real estate purchases center around his work, it’s clear he also likes to pick up places to “play.” There seems to be a trend with some of his recent acquisitions in locations that are less “metro.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn June, Griffin finalized the purchase of an estate on the French Riviera for $90 million. It consists of at least four structures on Tahiti Beach in Saint-Tropez.\n\nAnother upscale beach purchase was Calvin Klein‘s former Hamptons estate right at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic for $84.4 million. It’s located in the Meadow Lane stretch of Southampton, which is essentially known as “Billionaires Row at the Beach.”\n\nIn cooler climes, Griffin has a relatively modest multimillion-dollar home in Aspen, CO. So it’s definitely not all work and no play when it comes to Griffin’s real estate holdings.\n\nHowever, there may be other motives behind some of his “pleasure” purchases.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“There is a perceived prestige to owning high-end real estate in these markets, whether it be due to access to luxury shopping, world-class dining and entertainment, upscale beach lifestyles, or proximity to other influential and wealthy people,” says Bennett, of Wells Fargo. “A show property is more about luxury and lifestyle, wherein the inherent financial returns may be a secondary objective.”\n\nBennett says this might lead to taking on a greater level of risk when acquiring the property in return for the “status” or personal enjoyment the property affords.\n\nThe bottom line, however, is that wherever Griffin decides to live, he has more options than pretty much any other human being on the planet, and that’s got to be pleasurable.\n\nRelated Articles"}

It seemed funny at the time", "fullContent": "Last week, The Fence magazine ran an article about Crap Towns, a book series I started editing back around the turn of the millennium.\n\nCrap Towns was about the worst places in the UK. It was a survey based on nominations from people who wrote into a website - along with a few bits of research, photography and micky-taking that I carried out myself. I hoped it would be a book about the true state of the nation – a ‘domesday book of misery’, as an early critic described it.\n\nThis car, with its poor damaged face, was left for weeks near my house in Hackney, on my bike route home from work.\n\nThe Fence generously endorsed this idea by saying that Crap Towns was something that “struck at the real core values of British life: bodged buildings, massive class anxiety and rampant self-loathing.”\n\nThe author of the article, Adam Steiner, took Crap Towns in the spirit I’d always intended. He described it as an affectionate bit of chiding, an attempt to kick-start conversations about regeneration and how Britain could and should be better (as well as an excuse to have some fun with bad planning decisions, local corruption and car parks.)\n\nIt’s lovely to be talked about with such sympathy.\n\nBut there are complications. My thoughts about Crap Towns are conflicted for all kinds of reasons, but one of the most prominent is that it feels like a book from another age.\n\nI was reminded of that problem when Adam brought up the question I am now asked about Crap Towns with the most frequency.\n\nHe wanted to know whether it would still be possible to publish this kind of book today.\n\nAnd… well…\n\n“You wouldn’t get away with it now”\n\nIn the summer of 2021, when identitarian politics and all the related fear and loathing were close to their frenzied Covid peak, I took a call from another journalist who was writing a piece for the I paper about, as he put it, the “long rich tradition of various different UK towns being named the country’s worst.”\n\nHe was keen to talk to me as a “sort of founding father of the genre”. The fact that he thought of me as the progenitor of this absurd tradition was simultaneously great and disastrous for my ego. Should I be pleased? Should I be ashamed?\n\nBut it wasn’t that that knocked me sideways. Later on in the conversation, we got onto the current state of the nation and he said: “Of course, you wouldn’t get away with it now.”\n\nMany of other people - plenty of them journalists - have said the same thing to me since, but this was the first.\n\nIt felt like something I had to contend with.\n\nMy first thought was: “Oh shit, there goes the twentieth anniversary edition.”\n\nMy next was (slightly) less self-involved. Instinctively, I knew that my interviewer was right. So what did that imply about modern Britain? And was it good or bad?\n\nThere was part of me wanted to rail against this change. I wanted to conclude that we’ve lost our talent for self-deprecation - and that this was something lamentable. We can’t take jokes any more!\n\nBut there was also another part of me that could see that I was yelling at clouds.\n\nI realised that I was in danger of becoming just the kind of old fart that the younger version of me - the one who had come up with the idea of Crap Towns - might have enjoyed satirising. Which left me wondering - who was the asshole in that equation? Young me? Present me? Both of us?\n\nPlus, much as I wanted to blame everyone else for their inability to take jokes about their hometowns on the chin, I could also see the problem:\n\nCrap Towns was a book that blatantly and gleefully insulted everyone and everything. Maybe, just maybe, this big idea of mine had not been such a good one?\n\nFried brains\n\nThat Crap Towns was a bad book was definitely the opinion of some podcasters who put out an episode last year describing it as a “cursed object.”\n\nThey asked: “How did something so cursed - so unpleasant - end up as a national publishing sensation? Were our brains all fried by lads mags, New Labour and tabloid journalism?”\n\nThey answered those questions by explaining that the problem was that the books were meant to be humorous.\n\n“They want people to laugh and I find that so unappealing,” said one of the presenters.\n\nI could feel my head banging against the dustbin of history as she spoke.\n\nBut I have to admit I also find this kind of puritanical outrage pretty amusing. It’s one of life’s delicious ironies that people who don’t want to laugh are often inadvertently hilarious.\n\nEven so, I also felt sad and worried listening to that podcast. It reflected a kind of strident and confident righteousness that I’m not sure has been good for the world - and I’m not sure will stand up to the scrutiny of time.\n\nAfter all, if there is anything that ages even more badly than jokes, it’s moral certainties. I’m always reminded of poor old Miss Clack in Wilkie Collins’ Moonstone; so fervent in her belief that the moral tracts she insists on handing out are the final word in ethics, so gloriously unaware that Wilkie Collins was setting her up as a laughing stock.\n\nAnd that’s not to mention the actual puritans.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s rarely a good idea to silence the instinct to make jokes. We need scamps. They’re the ones who point out that the emperor isn’t wearing any clothes. Sometimes they’re also the ones that make unkind remarks about the size of his paunch. But I’d notch that up as the cost of allowing the kind of freedom that reveals true and important things.\n\nA nostalgic interlude\n\nThe other thing about scamps is that they help us have fun. And that was definitely one of the intentions of Crap Towns.\n\nBut maybe that was easier twenty years ago? Maybe everything seemed more enjoyable when there was at least a hope of change? And when hope was actually something people might consider voting for? When the world felt safer and kinder?\n\nI know that even back in 2003, not everyone enjoyed the joke. But I also remember that I wasn’t alone in wanting to make it. Thousands of people wrote into the website to share their own stories about the places they lived. Thousands of people bought the books. I like to hope that they enjoyed them too - and the fact that they became word-of-mouth bestsellers suggests that they might have.\n\nScreenshot from https://ruudleeuw.com/blog-2019q4.htm - Is it really true that the internet actually used to look like this?\n\nI went on dozens of radio shows, TV programmes to talk about Crap Towns - and I don’t think I was ever asked what the hell I thought I was doing. Even when local papers from the towns on the list got in touch, the journalists tended to think it was pretty funny. They would tell me as much when we spoke, as well as fervently agreeing about the problems on their beat. True, they then went on to write outraged front pages about the dastardly things that were being said about their town – but they did so in a way that let everyone know they were in on the joke. We were all laughing at ourselves and each other.\n\nIt makes me feel pretty nostalgic - not least because if it is indeed true that we’ve lost the ability to enjoy that kind of self-deprecating humour, we may be losing something important, alongside the pleasure of laughter.\n\nBecause that laughter also brought a kind of freedom. It enabled us to speak truths that might otherwise have felt too uncomfortable.\n\nAnd today, it can sometimes feel like all we’ve got left is the discomfort.\n\nThe fear factor\n\nThe good news is that I don’t think that the illiberalism of identity politics will endure much longer. Especially when it comes to the literal policing of humour - and cancellation of comedians for telling the wrong kinds of jokes.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean we aren’t still dealing with the repercussions. I can’t prove it, but I have a strong sense that there has been a nervousness about humour in the publishing industry for quite a few years.\n\nAfter all, is it always worth taking on projects that might upset people like the presenters of that Cursed Object podcast? How many editors and writers have found themselves second guessing these kinds of reactions and steering clear as a result?\n\nTo give one small example. A few days ago I was fortunate enough to talk to the novelist Jonathan Coe about his latest (very enjoyable!) book The Proof Of My Innocence. One of the sections of this book is a pastiche of auto-fiction, written in the combined voices of two twenty-something women.\n\nEven for a writer as established and successful as Jonathan Coe, inhabiting these different voices was brave. As he said to me, the contemporary climate would make anyone “nervous” about taking such a step. Writers are expected to stay in their lane. To do otherwise is to go against a lot of contemporary instincts.\n\nThe great thing about Jonathan Coe was that if he did indeed feel afraid, he did it anyway. Good job too because I thought the result was very funny and touchingly empathetic.\n\nIn fact, to be afraid and do it anyway is advice I’d want to give to most writers. I’d want to suggest that the fear and the sense of transgression might even be the things that make the end result interesting.\n\nThe two kinds of joke\n\nBut it’s not advice I myself can take in the case of Crap Towns. I’m not going to try to write another for a while. Because I worry that the books still might not work.\n\nThere are, after all, only two kinds of joke: those that were once funny and those that were never funny.\n\nMuch as I’d like to, I can’t just blame the puritans if my old jokes don’t work any more. Nor can I claim that the Crap Towns books were an unqualified success, even taken on the generous terms that Adam Steiner set out in The Fence Magazine.\n\nI mean: incredibly, governments and local councils didn’t read my work and decide to mend their ways. The UK did not get better. Instead we got more than a decade of Tory austerity, Brexit, and all the accompanying neglect and bad feeling.\n\nPeter Cook outside The Establishment Club. When he opened it he declared that the satire it put on would emulate all those political Berlin cabarets in the 1930s “which did so much to prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler.”\n\nThe joke has gone sour.\n\nI even worry that in trying to diagnose some of the alienation, boredom and despair that people in the UK were starting to feel, I actually might have added to the malaise.\n\nAn alternative answer\n\nExplaining everything that has gone wrong in the UK would take quite a few more articles like this one, so that’s probably enough for now. But before closing, I should admit that there is a more straightforward answer to the question of whether you can still get away with doing something like Crap Towns.\n\nThat answer is: yes.\n\nThere’s a website (I won’t link to it) that has kept on running a survey of the worst places in the UK for years and years- and, honestly, when I look at it, I hate it. Partly because I feel like they’re ripping off my project, but mainly because when I read the comments on there about incels and chavs and carbuncles and brutalism it all just seems grubby. Maybe even cruel.\n\nI could argue that I don’t like this website because their approach and criteria are different to mine - and I hope there would be some truth in that. But I also know that I now also just react against the whole thing. It’s been done. It’s grown stale. It doesn’t fit - especially since so much has changed around it.

EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM article WHERE author_id = 1; -- 优化后查询 EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM author LEFT JOIN article ON author.id = article.author_id WHERE author.id = 1;\n\n三、预加载高级技巧\n\n3.1 嵌套关联预加载\n\n处理多层级关联关系（作者->文章->评论）：\n\n# 三层级预加载示例 authors = await Author.all().prefetch_related( \"articles__comments\" # 双下划线表示嵌套关系 )\n\n3.2 条件预加载\n\n预加载时添加过滤条件：\n\n# 只预加载2023年发布的文章 authors = await Author.all().prefetch_related( articles=Article.filter(created_at__year=2023) )\n\n3.3 自定义预加载方法\n\n创建复杂查询的复用方法：\n\nclass Author(Model): @classmethod async def get_with_popular_articles(cls): return await cls.all().prefetch_related( articles=Article.filter(views__gt=1000) )\n\n四、课后Quiz\n\n当需要加载作者及其所有文章的标签时，正确的预加载方式是：\n\nA) prefetch_related(\"articles\")\n\nB) prefetch_related(\"articles__tags\")\n\nC) select_related(\"articles.tags\") 以下哪种场景最适合使用select_related？\n\nA) 获取用户基本信息\n\nB) 获取用户及其个人资料（一对一关系）\n\nC) 获取博客及其所有评论（一对多关系）\n\n答案与解析：\n\nB正确，双下划线语法用于跨模型预加载。C语法错误，select_related不能用于一对多关系 B正确，select_related优化一对一关系查询。一对多用prefetch_related更合适\n\n五、常见报错处理\n\n报错1：RelationNotFoundError\n\n原因：模型未正确定义关联字段\n\n解决方案：\n\n检查 related_name 拼写是否正确 确认关联模型已正确导入\n\n报错2：QueryTimeoutError\n\n原因：复杂预加载导致查询过慢\n\n解决方案：\n\n添加数据库索引 拆分查询为多个步骤 使用 only() 限制返回字段\n\n报错3：ValidationError\n\n原因：Pydantic模型字段不匹配\n\n解决方案：\n\n检查response_model字段类型 使用 orm_mode = True 配置 验证数据库字段类型是否匹配\n\n六、最佳实践建议\n\n始终在测试环境进行 EXPLAIN 查询分析 对频繁访问的接口添加Redis缓存层 为常用查询字段添加数据库索引 使用分页限制返回数据量 定期进行慢查询日志分析\n\n安装环境要求：\n\npip install fastapi uvicorn tortoise-orm pydantic\n\n配置Tortoise-ORM示例：\n\nfrom tortoise import Tortoise async def init_db(): await Tortoise.init( db_url='sqlite://db.sqlite3', modules={'models': ['path.to.models']} ) await Tortoise.generate_schemas()\n\n余下文章内容请点击跳转至 个人博客页面 或者 扫码关注或者微信搜一搜： 编程智域 前端至全栈交流与成长 ，阅读完整的文章：Tortoise-ORM级联查询与预加载性能优化 | cmdragon's Blog\n\n往期文章归档："}

News satirists aim to deliver the laughs people 'need so badly'", "fullContent": "The Sunday Magazine 22:39 Finding the funny in news satire when real life is no joke\n\nGiven a federal election campaign, whiplash over tariffs, a mercurial leader to the south, plus a steady stream of everything else going on in the world, satirists think humour can be the balm we need.\n\nToday's tumultuous news cycle is proving to be prime source material for satirical news outlets, but unlike their predecessors, they also face a thorny challenge: distinguishing their comedic \"fake news\" from nefarious misinformation and disinformation.\n\nIn dark or difficult times, satirists have to \"meet the moment\" they're in, says Luke Gordon Field, editor in chief of Canadian satirical outlet the Beaverton.\n\n\"The fact that every day we kind of live in this chaos bubble of, 'What's going to happen? What's [U.S. President Donald Trump] going to throw at us next?' ... You have to strive to do what the Onion did so beautifully after 9/11, which is give people that laugh that they need so badly,\" he told The Sunday Magazine host Piya Chattopadhyay.\n\nSatirical news stories won't sway voters or the course of an election, but satirists can identify 'BS when we see it,' said the Beaverton's Luke Gordon Field. (The Beaverton)\n\nSatirical news stories won't change how someone votes or sway the course of an election, Field says. But he thinks satirists — as modern-day court jesters — can still inspire reflection and clarity, with humour as their delivery method.\n\n\"Calling out the BS when we see it … and let people laugh at something that might otherwise make them stress out or cry,\" he said in Toronto.\n\n\"Not to be a complete pessimist about the world, but it doesn't seem like things are going to get wonderful any time soon.\"\n\nBoth the Beaverton's Field, left, and Christine Wenc, an original member of The Onion, draw a distinction between satirical fake news and rampant mis- and disinformation online today. (Submitted by Luke Gordon Field and Christine Wenc)\n\nWhen faced with a changing landscape where real news can sometimes seem like an Onion headline, satirists may have to try out creative new approaches, \"entering the conversation\" differently than before, says Christine Wenc, a founding member of the Onion and author of Funny Because It's True, a recently published historical account about the influential publication and website.\n\nShe points to the Onion's attempt to buy the disgraced disinformation site Infowars as one example.\n\n\"That's still hung up in court — no surprise there — but I thought that was very interesting that the Onion was kind of crossing into the real world in a new way,\" she said from Madison, Wis.\n\n\"A good satirist should be able to kind of take on anything.\"\n\nWATCH | Satirical pages get caught up in Facebook's news ban: Meta news block: Satirical site The Beaverton caught up in Canada ban Duration 6:26 Satirical pages are getting caught up in a Canadian news ban on Facebook and Instagram in response to a new Canadian law that would force Meta to compensate media outlets for content that is shared or repurposed on its platforms.\n\nSatirical fake news vs 'bad' fake news\n\nIn its early days during the 1990s, Onion staffers relished folks falling for their stories, Wenc said. She recalled, for instance, a satirical piece about a \"nicotine stick\" smoke-cessation aid — itself a cigarette — which drew emails from smokers trying to kick the habit and seeking the made-up product.\n\nYet with rampant misinformation and disinformation flooding the internet today, she describes a shift in thinking amongst that original crew. \"Now they're like, 'Yeah, maybe we shouldn't have been quite so excited about how easy it is to fool people.'\"\n\nThat said, Wenc emphasizes what she calls a clear distinction.\n\n\"The point of satire is to reveal and to make the world a better place, to point things out that are actually happening. And I think a lot of the bad fake news is just sowing chaos and destruction and making people afraid,\" she said.\n\n\"Not all fake news is the same.\"\n\nField admits folks still fall for Beaverton articles given the site's traditional news look and tone, but he believes there's an onus on the audience to think critically about what they see online.\n\n\"I just don't think it's the Onion or the Beaverton's responsibility to get people to understand that what some random website — with a domain name that sounds kind of like ABC News, but isn't ABC News — is saying is probably not accurate.\""}

Rating: About this rating False Context Trump's order rolls back guidance from previous Democratic presidents aimed at reducing racial disparities in school disciplinary actions such as suspensions and expulsions. The order says nothing about introducing or promoting physical force in school discipline, but it is unclear whether its call for a report on school policies \"rooted in American values and traditional virtues\" might include corporal punishment, which studies show is more likely to be given to Black students than white students.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled \"Reinstating Common Sense School Discipline Policies.\"\n\nIn response, social media users began spreading a rumor that Trump's order permits teachers to discipline their students through physical force. One April 23 TikTok video, which several Snopes readers sent us a screenshot of, claimed, \"Today Trump issued Executive Order allowing Teachers to physically 'discipline' students.\" The video has more than 70,000 likes as of this writing.\n\nWe rate this claim false. Trump's executive order does not explicitly address teachers using physical force to punish students, instead requesting new federal guidance revoking previous policies aimed at reducing racial disparities in school discipline. However, corporal punishment is still legal in many states, and it is not yet clear whether Trump's directive might accelerate that disparity.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Trump does not have the legal authority to permit corporal punishment in U.S. schools without an act of Congress. As we previously reported, an executive order is not a piece of legislation, but an official document shaping the federal government's operations. See our running list of Trump's executive orders here.\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request to clarify Trump's stance on corporal punishment in K-12 schools.\n\nThe executive order\n\nTrump's April 23 executive order on school discipline is available on the White House's website. The directive is focused on prohibiting racial equity policies in guidance issued by the federal government on school discipline, as stated in the second paragraph:\n\nSection 1. Purpose and Policy. The Federal Government will no longer tolerate known risks to children's safety and well-being in the classroom that result from the application of school discipline based on discriminatory and unlawful \"equity\" ideology.\n\nThe order calls for revoking previous guidance from the administrations of former presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama to reduce racial disparities in school discipline, specifically a 2014 letter sent by Obama's Department of Education and Department of Justice that warned schools they may be violating civil rights law if they discipline minority students at higher rates.\n\nTo be clear, the 2014 letter is not law itself, but guidance on how the federal government interprets the law. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already prohibits racial discrimination in public schools.\n\nThe first Trump administration revoked the Obama-era guidance, but Biden's administration released updated advice echoing the 2014 letter, although education advocates said it didn't go as far.\n\nOverwhelming evidence finds that Black students are disciplined at higher rates than white students, facing harsher disciplinary actions for even minor infractions, such as dress code violations.\n\n\"As a consequence of these policies, teachers and students are suffering increased levels of classroom disorder and school violence,\" Trump's executive order claimed, before instructing officials to issue new guidance on school discipline and \"their obligations not to engage in racial discrimination.\"\n\n(Evidence supporting Trump's claim is scant; studies indicate strict zero-tolerance policies do more harm than good, particularly for marginalized students. While research on nonpunitive alternatives is still emerging — some showing clear benefits, others showing no improvements in outcomes — these alternatives, such as nonjudgmental conflict resolution, do appear to improve the school environment.)\n\nTrump's order also directs officials to submit a report to the president \"regarding the status of discriminatory-equity-ideology-based school discipline and behavior modification techniques i n American public education,\" with an apparent reference to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI.\n\nAs such, nothing in the order explicitly provides direction on physical force in school discipline.\n\nCorporal punishment and Trump's administration\n\nHowever, it is possible that new guidance created by the Trump administration could promote or turn a blind eye to corporal punishment — or, at least, the inequitable use of it, according to advocates against physical discipline in schools.\n\n\"It's harmful for the entire school community to move away from research-based approaches to discipline, and it's particularly harmful for those students who are going to experience suspensions, expulsions, corporal punishment at higher rates from their peers,\" said Morgan Craven, policy director at the Intercultural Development Research Association, a Texas-based education advocacy group against corporal punishment. Meanwhile, Adaku Onyeka-Crawford, education advocate at civil rights group Advancement Project, said the order targets \"the successes of parents and students who have fought to get rid of overly harsh discipline policy such as corporal punishment.\"\n\nAs of 2024, corporal punishment was legal in 17 states and practiced in 14, according to the National Education Association, and six other states had not expressly prohibited it. Inequities in school discipline extend to the use of physical force; for example, federal data shows Black students were more than twice as likely to receive corporal punishment as their white peers and Native American students were almost twice as likely to during the 2017-18 school year.\n\nIt is worth noting that states that ban corporal punishment do not necessarily ban physical force — many of these states still allow physically restraining students to \"maintain order or discipline in the classroom,\" according to Craven.\n\nThe 2014 letter targeted by Trump's executive order listed \"corporal punishment policies that allow schools to paddle, spank, or otherwise physically punish students\" as a disciplinary action that can raise equity concerns. The guidance later issued by Biden's education officials does not explicitly mention the use of physical force in school discipline, but it does cite Department of Education demographic data on corporal punishment as an example of the \"significant disparities by race\" in \"the application of student discipline in schools\" (see Page 2).\n\nThe executive order also mentions promoting school discipline with \"traditional virtues\" (emphasis ours):\n\n(iv) model school discipline policies that promote common sense, protect the safety and educational environment of students, do not promote unlawful discrimination, and are rooted in American values and traditional virtues.\n\nCorporal punishment may be considered a traditional value by many of those who practice it — but the Trump administration does not appear to have a concrete stance on physical discipline in schools, making it mere speculation to suggest that \"traditional virtues\" equals \"promoting corporal punishment.\"\n\n\"Violence against children is consistent with how a lot of children have been treated in schools and communities in America because it was sanctioned by the government, like Indian boarding schools,\" Craven said. \"If what we're looking at is tradition and values, there's a really ugly tradition of treating children poorly to try to get them to conform.\"\n\nBut both Onyeka-Crawford and Craven pointed out that the language used in the executive order is vague, so we don't yet know exactly what the guidance in the report ordered by the directive will say.\n\n\"It all depends on the actual words of the guidance, which haven't been created,\" Onyeka-Crawford said.\n\nThus, while the Trump administration did not permit physical discipline of students, it's still legal in many states — and the executive order Trump signed may exacerbate already existing racial disparities in corporal punishment."}

Liverpool, under the guidance of Arne Slot, require just a single point to confirm their 20th league title, bringing an incredible season to a fitting crescendo against Tottenham.\n\nThere was a palpable sense of calm from Slot as he previewed Sunday’s 4.30pm BST kick-off, revealing no fresh fitness concerns ahead of what could be a landmark afternoon for the club.\n\nConor Bradley Progresses as Reds Carefully Manage His Return\n\nAttention naturally turned to Conor Bradley, who has been carefully eased back into action. Having played 68 minutes against West Ham United and 71 at Leicester City, the young defender is inching closer to a full 90-minute shift.\n\n“That depends of course on the upcoming two sessions, but he was getting closer and closer to 90 minutes,” said Slot.\n\n“The first and the second one were approximately the same amount of minutes and it’s normal if you played twice around 70 minutes then the chance of you being able to play 90 is getting closer and closer.\n\n“But we are also taking very good care of him because he had two injuries that were similar. Let’s wait and see how he does today and tomorrow if he’s able to play, and if he’s able to play if he can make 90.”\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold’s timely return offered Liverpool added security, his winning goal against Leicester sealing a vital win. Slot’s careful management of Bradley hints at Liverpool’s long-term thinking, ensuring every player remains at peak fitness as they close in on glory.\n\nJoe Gomez’s recovery is also moving in the right direction. Although the No.2 is yet to return to full training following his February injury, Slot remains optimistic that the versatile defender will feature again before the campaign concludes.\n\nLuis Diaz Nears Milestone as Liverpool Chase Silverware\n\nAnother subplot to Sunday’s clash sees Luis Diaz poised to make his 100th Premier League appearance. Should he feature, he will become the 60th Liverpool player to reach such a milestone — a remarkable achievement for the dynamic Colombian winger who has been a pivotal figure this season.\n\nLiverpool fans will also recall their dominant showings against Tottenham earlier in the season. A breathless 6-3 league win and a 4-1 aggregate triumph in the Carabao Cup semi-finals have given Slot’s men psychological ascendancy.\n\nYet Slot is mindful of late-season unpredictability.\n\n“You can always be surprised by a game plan of a manager,” he said. “But in the end of the season, every team played so many games and it would be a bit weird to change their playing style in the end of a season. During the season this can happen a bit more.\n\n“Tottenham know the way we play, we know the way they play. You can always adjust some details. But I think the big picture is clear for Ange Postecoglou and for me as well, what we can expect.”\n\nTottenham Seek Redemption Without Son Heung-min\n\nTottenham’s hopes of spoiling Liverpool’s party have been hampered by the continued absence of Son Heung-min. The influential forward, who boasts an impressive scoring record at Anfield, remains sidelined with a foot injury.\n\nSon’s absence has been keenly felt, and Ange Postecoglou confirmed there would be no return for his captain this weekend.\n\n“Squad-wise, there’s no change,” Postecoglou told Tottenham’s official website.\n\n“All the guys got through [Forest] OK. In terms of rehab, Sonny’s the only one who is going through that process, improving, but not ready for Sunday.”\n\nPostecoglou’s preparations are also complicated by Tottenham’s European commitments. Spurs host Bodo/Glimt in a Europa League semi-final first leg on Thursday, forcing the Australian to balance his squad carefully.\n\n“Again, with the programme we have coming up, Thursday obviously is a big night for us,” he added. “So, it will be a matter of playing a few that need the game time and others we feel may need less exposure. We’ll have a look at that.”\n\nRecent Form Points Towards Liverpool Dominance\n\nLiverpool’s narrow but crucial 1-0 victory at Leicester last week underscored their resilience and winning mentality, with Alisson, Bradley, Konate, Van Dijk, and Tsimikas forming a resolute defensive wall. Further forward, Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Salah, Szoboszlai, Gakpo, and Diaz showed the attacking intent that has defined their title charge.\n\nTottenham, meanwhile, slumped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat against Nottingham Forest, fielding a side that included Vicario, Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, and Spence. Despite glimpses of creativity from Kulusevski and Richarlison, Spurs struggled to find a cutting edge.\n\nSunday’s clash is laden with storylines. For Liverpool, it is a chance to etch a new chapter into their storied history. For Tottenham, it is an opportunity to demonstrate resilience against the odds.\n\nWhatever unfolds, Anfield will be ready to roar."}

In a revealing episode of A Eye Scouted from Anfield Index Pro, Dave Hendrick and Karl Matchett dissect Liverpool’s dominance and Tottenham’s decline with sharp, insightful commentary.\n\nLiverpool’s March Toward Title Number 20\n\nAs Dave Hendrick enthusiastically pointed out, Liverpool head into the weekend needing just “one point against Tottenham” to secure the title. Hendrick opened the discussion highlighting Liverpool’s consistency at home, asserting, “Our home form is obviously the best in the Premier League for the season as a whole.”\n\nKarl Matchett also shared his optimism for Liverpool’s superiority, dismissing any real threat from Tottenham by noting, “There isn’t really anything technical, tactical, or mental which should prevent anything other than Spurs being beaten again this weekend.” The duo’s confidence was palpable throughout, anchored in Liverpool’s imperious form and Tottenham’s miserable away record.\n\nTottenham’s Troubles: A Season to Forget\n\nWhen turning their attention to Tottenham, both Matchett and Hendrick painted a grim picture. Hendrick wryly summarised Spurs’ plight, saying, “Spurs away form is one of the worst in the entire league.” He even went as far as quoting a statistic he had seen: “If Liverpool stopped playing on Christmas Day, we’d still have more points than Spurs for this season.”\n\nMatchett didn’t hold back either, describing Spurs as “obviously not a good side” and “not a mentally strong side,” highlighting that Tottenham have taken only “four points from their last seven league matches.” Hendrick added further damning evidence by stating, “They’ve had 15 defeats by one goal. That is the sign of a mentally weak team.”\n\nQuotes That Tell the Story\n\nThroughout the podcast, the stark contrast between Liverpool’s relentless consistency and Tottenham’s alarming decline was underlined with cutting remarks. Hendrick, reflecting on Tottenham’s alarming collapse, said, “This would be a relegation scrap for Spurs if it wasn’t for the ineptitude of the three clubs that came up last season.”\n\nKarl Matchett offered a fitting conclusion: “Spurs are way, way, way below where they should be,” pointing to their shocking inconsistency and lack of mental resilience.\n\nDiscussing the potential Europa League fortunes, Matchett remained sceptical of Tottenham’s chances: “Spurs on any given day are like really, really odd beasts to kind of put into a category.” He backed Athletic Bilbao over Spurs, citing the Basque club’s “mentality side for really big moments.”\n\nLiverpool’s Destiny in Their Own Hands\n\nLiverpool’s confidence, expertly captured by Hendrick and Matchett, rests on a season of hard work, tactical discipline, and mental strength. In stark contrast, Tottenham’s season has unravelled spectacularly, and even their slim hopes of Europa League glory seem overshadowed by their domestic woes.\n\nAs Karl Matchett succinctly summed it up: “There’s no fight in this Spurs team.” And with Liverpool needing just a solitary point, Anfield looks set to celebrate a monumental achievement once again."}

Among the season’s most notable players are a number of Liverpool stars, and former Reds captain Jamie Carragher has recognised this excellence by selecting four Liverpool players in his Premier League Team of the Season. However, despite their impressive form, one key figure from the current Liverpool squad has been notably left out of Carragher’s picks.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/goal/status/1912898860587843947\n\nLiverpool’s Strong Representation\n\nAs Liverpool marches towards the 2024/25 Premier League title, their players have been integral to their success this season. Among those who have helped propel the team are Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah, and Ryan Gravenberch, all of whom have featured prominently in the league. Each of these players has been ever-present in the starting XI, making them worthy contenders for the league’s top honours.\n\nThe Reds’ stellar season has not gone unnoticed, with several players named in the EA SPORTS FC Premier League Team of the Season nominations. The likes of Van Dijk, Salah, and Gravenberch have all been recognised for their contributions, yet it was surprising to see that one of these players did not feature in Carragher’s own selection.\n\nSurprising Snub for Ryan Gravenberch\n\nOne of the more surprising aspects of Carragher’s Team of the Season was his decision to exclude Ryan Gravenberch. Despite the Dutch midfielder’s impressive performances throughout the season, which have played a key role in Liverpool’s midfield dominance, Carragher opted for different selections. Gravenberch’s absence is especially noteworthy given the impact he has had since joining the club, but Carragher’s picks were somewhat unconventional.\n\nIn midfield, Carragher selected Alexis Mac Allister, who has excelled for Liverpool in his debut season. Alongside Mac Allister are Arsenal’s Declan Rice and Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White. While each of these players has enjoyed strong seasons, Gravenberch’s exclusion from the midfield ranks is likely to raise some eyebrows, given his form in the engine room for Liverpool.\n\nCarragher’s Other Selections\n\nCarragher’s Premier League Team of the Season certainly did not shy away from featuring players who have been key for Liverpool in their pursuit of the title. In goal, Alisson Becker made the cut, his remarkable performances including a standout showing away to Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League.\n\nIn defence, Carragher chose Virgil van Dijk, the talismanic centre-back who has once again been among the best in the league. Van Dijk has been a rock at the heart of Liverpool’s defence, and his inclusion in the team is hardly a surprise. He was joined by Ola Aina at right-back, Nikola Milenković in central defence, and Antonee Robinson at left-back.\n\nShift in the Attack\n\nWhen it came to attacking options, Carragher’s choices were equally intriguing. Mohamed Salah, of course, made the cut, maintaining his place as one of the Premier League’s most lethal forwards. Joining him in attack were Alexander Isak, the Newcastle United striker who has impressed with his goalscoring ability, and Matheus Cunha, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool in the near future.\n\nCarragher’s selections highlighted the diversity of talent in the Premier League this season, with standout players from a variety of clubs making the cut. His decision to choose players from outside of Liverpool, including Fulham’s Aina and Wolves’ Milenković, as well as those from Arsenal and Nottingham Forest, reflects the strength of the division.\n\nConclusion: Liverpool’s Rising Stars\n\nWhile Carragher’s Premier League Team of the Season includes four Liverpool players, the absence of Gravenberch has caused some debate. Nevertheless, the overall selections underscore the individual brilliance on display throughout the Premier League, with Liverpool continuing to be well represented at the top of the table.\n\nAs Liverpool looks to secure the title, their players remain among the best in the league. Whether or not Carragher’s selections will align with the official honours at the season’s close remains to be seen, but one thing is clear—Liverpool’s stars are proving themselves in what has been a remarkable campaign."}

With Arne Slot preparing for his first summer window in charge, the club is plotting aggressive moves in both defence and attack. Credit to TBR Football for highlighting a revealing report that underlines both the ambition and internal debate surrounding Liverpool’s transfer targets.\n\nStrengthening the Spine\n\nLiverpool’s reported interest in Newcastle United’s Alexander Isak, as per TEAMtalk’s Fraser Fletcher, speaks to a broader desire to add clinical precision to their frontline. The Swedish international is fast, intelligent, and proven in the Premier League – a profile that perfectly aligns with Slot’s preference for mobile, multi-functional forwards. But while adding firepower is key, the battle for defensive solidity is stealing the spotlight.\n\nAccording to TBR journalist Graeme Bailey, Liverpool are “favourites” to sign 20-year-old Spanish centre-back Dean Huijsen, who has impressed during his debut Premier League season at Bournemouth after moving from Juventus. Bailey reports: “Having spoken to Bournemouth sources, they reiterated that they see him most likely staying in the Premier League and from what they believe, the favourites for him are Liverpool, not to discount Chelsea or even Arsenal or Newcastle, but Liverpool are pushing hard.”\n\nThe fee? A cool £50million release clause – a steep sum, yet increasingly typical for elite young defenders in today’s market. Bournemouth, for their part, are eager to get the deal done quickly. “Huijsen and his camp would like it, but they are waiting – they are assessing,” Bailey added. “In conversations I have had with clubs on the continent, I would not rule Real Madrid or Bayern Munich out of this hunt just yet.”\n\nLeft-Back Conundrum\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing twist in this tale isn’t Huijsen’s future, but rather the internal divide within Liverpool regarding who should occupy the left-back slot next season. TEAMtalk have reported that Bournemouth’s Milos Kerkez is Arne Slot’s number one target – a fiery, energetic Hungary international described by ex-AZ Alkmaar teammate Mathew Ryan as “aggressive” and “powerful” in Soccer News.\n\nKerkez, just 21, would cost £45million – another sizeable outlay. Yet TBR now claim that not everyone at Anfield is sold on him. Some within the Liverpool hierarchy are pushing for Fulham’s Antonee Robinson instead. While Kerkez is seen as a talent with high upside, Robinson is considered more Premier League-ready. “Whilst Kerkez is viewed as a player with high ceiling, Robinson is currently seen as the best left-back in the Premier League and is ready to slot in from the off,” notes the report.\n\nThere’s also a romantic twist – Robinson spent time at Everton during his youth, so settling in the North West wouldn’t be an issue. Whether that appeals to fans is a different matter.\n\nWhat This Means for Slot\n\nSlot’s first window is shaping up to be a defining moment. He inherits a side built by Jurgen Klopp but with fresh demands. The Dutchman will want defenders comfortable in high lines, attackers who press instinctively, and full-backs who can invert or overlap on command. In Huijsen and Kerkez, he’d have raw but high-potential options. In Isak and Robinson, he’d get ready-made Premier League stars.\n\nYet this is not just a footballing decision – it’s a political one. That there’s division over which left-back to prioritise suggests Liverpool are walking a tightrope between long-term planning and instant impact. With Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea set to strengthen, Liverpool’s margin for error is shrinking.\n\nWho Has Final Say?\n\nWhat complicates matters further is Bournemouth’s urgency. They want Huijsen gone sooner rather than later to sign a replacement. But as Bailey clarified, “the decision is not with them, it is on Huijsen.” The defender appears to be biding his time, weighing his options. Madrid and Bayern’s interest muddies the waters – and if either come calling, even Liverpool’s push may not be enough.\n\nMeanwhile, TEAMtalk’s Rudy Galetti reports Liverpool may cut ties with one of their senior forwards this summer – another move that hints at significant overhaul.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nExpectant Liverpool Supporter Reaction\n\nFrom an Anfield faithful’s perspective, this report is equal parts thrilling and frustrating.\n\nOn one hand, the idea of landing Dean Huijsen – a ball-playing, fearless centre-back – aligns perfectly with where modern football is headed. He’s young, composed, and already hardened in the Premier League. If there’s truth to Liverpool “pushing hard,” that’s music to our ears. At £50million, it’s a big fee, but not ridiculous if he becomes the new Virgil.\n\nWhere the worry creeps in is the left-back debate. Milos Kerkez is raw and full of drive, but Antonee Robinson is Premier League royalty right now. That some inside the club can’t agree on the right profile is a bit alarming. Slot needs clarity and unity behind the scenes if his first window is to succeed.\n\nAnd then there’s Isak. An ambitious target, yes, but also a statement one. If Liverpool pull that off, it would send shockwaves across the league.\n\nIn short? This summer feels huge. A proper fork-in-the-road window. Get it right, and Slot’s Liverpool could fly.

He emphasised the severity by noting, “It’s not outside the realms of possibility that they lose all five of their remaining games,” listing Liverpool away, West Ham away, Crystal Palace home, Aston Villa away, and Brighton home.\n\nTottenham’s Shocking Premier League Statistics\n\nDave Hendrick didn’t hold back when laying out Tottenham’s failings this season. “They’ve already lost 18 Premier League games,” he highlighted. “They’ve only played 33 games, they’ve lost 18 of them.” For context, Hendrick added that relegation-bound Ipswich had “only lost 20,” just two more than Spurs, underlining how shocking Spurs’ season has been.\n\nYet amidst the chaos, Tottenham’s attack remains strangely potent. Hendrick pointed out, “You’re only looking at Liverpool, City, Arsenal and Newcastle who scored more goals than them.” However, defensively, Spurs’ issues have been a major downfall: “They’ve conceded 51 goals,” which places them amongst the bottom seven defences, though he clarified, “It’s not like a bottom two defence.”\n\nDespite everything, Spurs are anomalously clinging to a positive goal difference. “They’ve got a goal difference of plus 10,” Hendrick observed. It is a rare statistic for a team sitting so low in the table, with clubs above them such as Brighton, Fulham, and Brentford all boasting worse figures.\n\nLiverpool’s Singular Focus on Finishing Strong\n\nAs Liverpool gear up for what could be a historic weekend, Hendrick made it clear: “The only thing that matters is that we get the job done.” He added, “Ultimately the performance is completely irrelevant this Sunday,” underlining that securing at least one point is the absolute priority.\n\nHowever, Hendrick’s ambition for Liverpool didn’t end there. “I would like to see us sprint through the tape,” he said, yearning not just for survival but dominance. “I want to see us absolutely hammer home the fact that we’ve been the best team in the league this season.”\n\nHe also championed Virgil van Dijk’s call for an all-red Anfield, urging fans: “Wear something red whether it’s a shirt, a red jumper, a red t-shirt, bring a scarf, whatever — make Anfield red, make it as loud as possible.”\n\nTottenham Unlikely to Spoil the Party\n\nHendrick’s confidence was palpable when assessing Tottenham’s ability to challenge Liverpool. He summed it up crisply: “Tottenham in a spiral and incapable of spoiling Liverpool.” With Spurs likely distracted by European commitments and spiralling domestic form, Liverpool’s title ambitions look ever more likely to be realised.\n\nAs Hendrick concluded with hopeful anticipation, “Next time I speak to you on Monday, I might be reminding you that the Reds are Premier League champions.”"}

On the latest episode of the Anfield Index’s Scout Tomies podcast, Jim Boardman and Jay Reid captured the anticipation and emotion running through the veins of the club.\n\nMixed emotions ahead of the potential title win\n\nThe mood amongst Liverpool supporters is a blend of excitement and cautious optimism. “I’m trying not to get too excited because we’ve not won the league yet,” admitted Jim Boardman, reflecting the mood of many Reds. Jay Reid echoed the sentiment, noting the lingering nerves: “You can’t help but be excited, but… maybe it’s just years of watching Liverpool and expecting things at times.”\n\nIt’s not just about lifting the trophy – it’s about doing it the Liverpool way. “We didn’t want to win it by default that Arsenal messed up,” Jay emphasised. Liverpool’s fans and players are determined to secure the Premier League title on merit, with performances on the pitch reflecting the resilience and consistency that have been the hallmark of this season.\n\nTottenham clash looms large at Anfield\n\nLooking ahead to the fixture against Tottenham, Jay Reid was pragmatic but confident. “You couldn’t really have asked for a better opponent,” he said. With Tottenham’s defence described as “absolutely woeful” and their season “almost as bad as Man United’s”, Liverpool’s path seems well set.\n\nJim Boardman was equally bullish: “Tottenham haven’t been the best this season,” adding that the atmosphere should be electric but not laden with pressure. Both hosts made it clear: it’s about focusing on Liverpool’s strengths, staying professional, and finishing the job in style.\n\nAnfield atmosphere will be crucial\n\nA significant theme of the podcast was the emphasis on the power of Anfield itself. Reid passionately explained: “When it’s noisy… it’s putting the fear of God into a right back,” underlining how a raucous crowd can impact the opposition.\n\nNew manager Arne Slot has called on fans to play their part too. As Jim quoted from Slot’s press conference: “Hopefully the team, the players can bring the energy the same mentality towards the game as they’ve brought throughout the whole season and the fans we’re expecting the same from them.”\n\nJay Reid hammered the point home: “If you’re normally one who doesn’t sing, start singing. If you’re not sure of the words, get them learned.” The importance of the famed Anfield roar cannot be overstated.\n\nA generational moment for Liverpool fans\n\nFor Jay Reid, Sunday represents a personal milestone. “I’m 37 years of age and this is the first time I’m going to Anfield to see us potentially win the league,” he revealed. This sentiment resonates across a generation of Liverpool fans who have supported the club through decades of near-misses and heartbreaks.\n\nJim Boardman fondly recalled previous title memories, noting the eeriness of a 1-0 win over Tottenham back in 1988. Yet both contributors agree: this occasion feels different. With consistency, professionalism, and determination, Liverpool have earned their place at the summit of the Premier League once again.\n\nAs Jay put it succinctly: “We’ve been the best and we deserve it by a mile.”\n\nOn Sunday, under the banners and roars of Anfield, Liverpool can seal their destiny. The Premier League crown awaits – and the Red tide is ready to rise."}

Speaking on the Men in Blazers podcast with Rog Bennett, Slot reflected on a journey that shattered assumptions about succeeding a figure like Jürgen Klopp. Rog framed it best: Slot’s leadership represents “one of the single most remarkable acts of transformational leadership the Premier League has ever witnessed.”\n\nSlot’s Liverpool side sits just three points away from a historic 20th league title. In his words, the secret to their resilience lies in “being able as a human being to work four months in a row without hardly any day off,” a brutal contrast to the winter breaks he experienced in Holland.\n\nBest Moments from an Unforgettable Campaign\n\nReflecting on the season’s most electrifying moments, Slot’s voice brimmed with pride. He cited “Virgil just before the end had it a goal in against West Ham” and Trent Alexander-Arnold’s thunderous strike “10 minutes before the end against Leicester” as standouts. “Big players always show up in big moments,” he emphasised.\n\nRog summed up the spectacle perfectly when he said: “It’s hard to believe the Premier League doesn’t have a scriptwriter for these kind of joyful, exuberant exclamation point moments.”\n\nSlot also treasured moments from less glamorous fixtures: “Brentford away, 90 minutes played, nil-nil, Darwin Nunes scoring a goal — I think Trent assisted that one as well.”\n\nAbove all, Slot believes the best is still ahead: “I hope the most beautiful one is still to come.”\n\nLearning and Adjusting: Slot’s Tactical Tweaks\n\nSlot’s humility shone throughout the podcast. When asked about mistakes, he admitted: “When we lost against Forest at home, in the last 20 or 25 minutes I played Trent in midfield… it wasn’t a big success at that moment and I’ve never did it afterwards again.”\n\nSlot’s realism in acknowledging fine margins was refreshing. “Eight out of 10 times, it was a close margin,” he said, noting how hard it is to dominate in today’s Premier League where the days of easy wins are “probably past us.”\n\nBuilding on Klopp’s Legacy\n\nRog pushed Slot on how much credit he allows himself versus Klopp’s foundation. Slot answered with humility: “We inherited the team that played for the past six, seven or eight years a major part in English football… we wanted to continue on the work Jürgen did and add a few things.”\n\nImportantly, he stressed that keeping Liverpool’s leaders, like Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah, was vital. “To retain the DNA of the winning culture,” he agreed with Rog. Slot reflected, “There’s a lot of research done that the longer the team plays together, the better they start to play.”\n\nSlot’s final reflections were grounded in humanity. Despite the enormous achievement, he said: “A year ago I was the father of Isa and Yup and the husband of my wife Miriam, and a year later I’m still that person.”\n\nIf one more victory secures Liverpool’s title, it will not just be Slot’s best moment — it will be a Premier League memory for the ages."}

With recruitment in full motion, the noise around Flamengo’s Wesley Franca, reported by Bruno Lemos, underlines the club’s renewed focus on youth and succession planning.\n\nDefence Rebuild Gains Urgency\n\nWhile attention rightly remains on securing domestic silverware, it’s clear Liverpool’s hierarchy is preparing for a defensive evolution. The arrivals of Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen are gaining traction, and with Trent Alexander-Arnold’s rumoured move to Real Madrid, the right-back spot now feels like a strategic priority.\n\n“Milos Kerkez looks likely to join while the race for Dean Huijsen is getting frantic more than a month before the window even thinks about opening.”\n\nThat urgency reflects the need for energy and flexibility in a defence that’s ageing in places. While centre-back reinforcements are expected, it’s the right side of defence drawing major attention. With Alexander-Arnold reportedly bound for Spain, Liverpool are seeking his long-term successor — and Wesley could well be that player.\n\nWesley Talks Suggest Growing Momentum\n\n“Liverpool have two options for their recruitment at right-back this summer. They can either go for a new, expensive starter or they can bring in a younger, more inexperienced option to battle it out with Conor Bradley.”\n\nAccording to RTI Esporte, Liverpool have met with Wesley’s agents to discuss a summer move, and the club are seen as one of the frontrunners for his signature. “Liverpool meet with Wesley’s agents,” the report notes, adding that Manchester City are also monitoring the situation.\n\nBruno Lemos, the respected Brazilian journalist, confirmed on social media:\n\n“About Wesley. As previously anticipated, the player is being coveted by Liverpool and Manchester United. Their representatives travelled to England.”\n\nSobre Wesley. Conforme já havia antecipado , o jogador está sendo cobiçado por Liverpool e Manchester United. Seus representantes viajaram para a Inglaterra.#Flamengo #CRF @1MauroSantAnna pic.twitter.com/6ejr5vwqcT — Bruno Lemos (@Lemos_Santos) April 24, 2025\n\nWesley’s agents are in the country, exploring potential Premier League fits for the Flamengo full-back. At just 21, Wesley has drawn praise from his manager Filipe Luís, who labelled him “exceptional.” His pace, stamina, and growing tactical awareness make him a strong candidate to compete with Conor Bradley — even if he’s not yet ready to command a starting berth at Anfield.\n\nPatience Required Amid Flamengo’s Firm Stance\n\nThere is, however, a twist. Flamengo are reportedly unwilling to release Wesley before this summer’s Club World Cup, a tournament the Brazilian side value deeply. That could delay any immediate transition to Merseyside.\n\n“However, although Flamengo are claimed to be expecting to lose Wesley in the near future, they will reportedly not allow the full-back to leave before this summer’s Club World Cup.”\n\nTiming, then, may be the only hurdle. Yet for Liverpool, who have long succeeded by thinking two steps ahead, this feels like another smart piece of groundwork. With Conor Bradley developing rapidly and Wesley offering high-upside support, Arne Slot could be handed an adaptable, youth-fuelled defensive duo heading into next season.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThis feels like a real turning of the page in how Liverpool are shaping their squad with precision. For supporters, the reported pursuit of Wesley is the kind of forward-thinking strategy we’ve craved. He’s not just a player with flair and promise; he’s someone who could become a long-term solution on the right if managed correctly.\n\nOf course, there’s cautious optimism. Losing Trent would be an emotional gut-punch — he’s a Scouser, a Champions League winner, and the creative heartbeat of our backline. But if that’s inevitable, then planning now makes sense. Wesley being described as “exceptional” by Filipe Luís carries real weight, especially from a man who knows the European game.\n\nThe key is in how Slot integrates such talent. Can Wesley challenge Bradley and grow within the club’s high standards? If so, we’re looking at a setup that can evolve without sacrificing identity. And for a fanbase adjusting to change, that’s reassuring. Credit to Bruno Lemos for shining light on the steps being taken — because if this is what life after Klopp looks like, we’ll take it."}

Andor season 2 delivers on both cinema craft and spacecraft in its opening minutes with an incredible TIE Fighter heist, and I know I wasn’t alone in seeing that ship and saying, “that will make an incredible LEGO set!” Builder Michał Kozłowski, aka Edge of Bricks, was inspired by the first shots of the TIE Avenger in the Andor trailer and set to work making a remarkably screen-accurate version from 1,088 parts.\n\nOriginally appearing in the PC game Star Wars: TIE Fighter, the TIE Avenger is a cousin to the TIE Interceptor. A quality over quantity shift from the standard TIE strategy, the Avenger is equipped with heavier armor plating, a robust armament, and a hyperdrive. Michał’s model captures the wing-mounted missiles, but it is missing the heavy laser beneath the cockpit and the rotary cannons to the sides, which we didn’t get a clear look at until the first episode premiered this week. No doubt Michał will correct this, and in the meantime, it’s a remarkable likeness on a quick turnaround\n\nI like the change of color for this prototype TIE. Not only is black used sparingly, but we even get swatches of yellow!\n\nThe cockpit opens like in the show, but here’s another place where there’s room for Michał and others to iterate now that there are more references available, as the ramp should double as stairs for the pilot and possible passengers to enter.\n\nNitpicks aside, Michał’s model is a wonderful take on this newly debuted Imperial vehicle. While the only Andor set to be announced so far is an updated take on the Rebel U-Wing, it seems likely that this ship could appear as an official set in the future. In the meantime, if you’re intrested in learning more about how Michał created his version, he describes the process on his YouTube channel.\n\nAnd with Star Wars Day promotions fast approaching, should be in the market for a TIE Fighter of your own, the UCS TIE Interceptor and TIE Bomber playset are still available from LEGO.\n\nRelated"}

Speaking on Rival Recon from Anfield Index Pro, host Hari Sethi and guest Sean Walsh of Goal provided a deep dive into what lies ahead for Liverpool and the ongoing turmoil at Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nLiverpool’s March to the Title\n\nAs Hari Sethi emphasised at the outset, “It’s all come down to this… Arne Slot’s league-leading Reds are a mere one point away from clinching Liverpool’s 20th league title and doing so in front of a packed Anfield for the first time in decades.” The stakes are enormous, and Sunday’s clash against Tottenham offers the perfect stage for Liverpool’s coronation.\n\nTottenham arrive at Anfield beleaguered and out of sorts, and it would be difficult to envision anything other than a Liverpool triumph. As Sethi put it, Spurs are arriving with “an injury-decimated squad and a manager who’s seemingly been drained of much of his initial optimism.”\n\nTottenham’s Broken Season: Walsh’s Blunt Verdict\n\nSean Walsh did not pull his punches when diagnosing Tottenham’s current malaise. Reflecting on the broader picture, he remarked, “Spurs are a little bit of a basket case of a club.” Years of searching for silverware under the likes of Mourinho and Conte have instead left Spurs “living out that reality” — lower finishes without the trophies once promised.\n\nWalsh articulated the sentiment surrounding Spurs’ decline: “It’s gotten to a ridiculous point with ourselves and Manchester United… but now there’s a real chance to try and save the season.” Yet, as he admitted, “The domestic season has been complete and utter failure.”\n\nPostecoglou’s philosophy has been a topic of much scrutiny. Despite early promise, with Walsh noting Spurs “won seven out of the first nine or ten games” and that “the football was incredible,” the campaign soon collapsed. The 4-1 defeat against Chelsea, after initially leading, was a tipping point. “If you said at that point that by April Spurs would be 16th in the form table, you would have thought, what the hell has happened?”\n\nTactical Stubbornness and the Toll of Injuries\n\nHigh-risk football has defined Postecoglou’s reign. As Walsh explained, “There’s been a devotion to a particular philosophy… a tactical approach, the high-wire act.” Yet, injuries have severely hampered the project. Key moments like James Maddison’s injury in the chaotic Chelsea loss, where “he’d been the best player in the Premier League that season,” underlined how fortunes turned swiftly.\n\nWalsh defended the manager to an extent: “It wasn’t fair to judge Postecoglou during that tricky winter period,” given the “ridiculous” injury list. However, he acknowledged that the consistency never returned: “Every time you think there’s light at the end of the tunnel, it’s an oncoming train.”\n\nLeadership Void and Squad Fragility\n\nA damning indictment came from Walsh regarding Spurs’ leadership group. He observed, “The leaders aren’t good enough to take their own instincts into account,” referencing Yves Bissouma and Cristian Romero’s inconsistent displays. Even Son Heung-min, lauded for leading by example, was said to have physically declined, making it harder to impact games as captain.\n\nWalsh highlighted a profound systemic issue: “It must be so easy for opposition analysts to look at Spurs and say, ‘this is how we’re going to attack them and this is how we’re going to stop them’.” Predictability and tactical rigidity, he suggested, have rendered Spurs “easy to plan against,” exposing both management and squad weaknesses."}

This upward momentum coincides with their collaboration with Booz Allen Hamilton on the Space Llama AI tech stack, an initiative that underscores Meta's capability in advancing AI technology for both space operations and terrestrial industries. The innovative characteristics of Space Llama, especially its application in space missions, may have bolstered investor confidence, adding weight to the broader positive market trends. As the market sees continued recovery, Meta's developments highlight its potential contribution to technological advancements.\n\nEvery company has risks, and we've spotted 1 weakness for Meta Platforms you should know about.\n\nNasdaqGS:META Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Apr 2025\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 21 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nThe recent collaboration between Meta Platforms and Booz Allen Hamilton on the Space Llama AI tech stack signifies a critical advancement in AI applications, which is pivotal given the company's strategic focus on AI-driven growth. This initiative could potentially enhance Meta's capability to drive long-term user engagement and advertising revenue, aligning with its broader AI investment narrative. Over the past three years, Meta's shares delivered a total return of 174.28%, indicating significant growth and reflecting positively on its capacity to leverage technology for market expansion. In comparison, Meta's shares exceeded the Interactive Media and Services industry, which saw lower growth over the past year.\n\nIn terms of financial forecasts, the partnership could potentially influence revenue and earnings by introducing new use cases for AI, paving the way for further monetization opportunities. This aligns with analysts' expectations of substantial growth in revenue, anticipating a rise from the current $164.50 billion. While the current share price stands at US$500.28, the consensus analyst price target is US$722.91, suggesting a potential upside of over 30%. The price movement in response to the Space Llama venture may be seen as a positive signal by investors, likely contributing to a stronger outlook on future performance.\n\nClick to explore a detailed breakdown of our findings in Meta Platforms' financial health report.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders went live in the US\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nNintendo Switch 2 pre-orders finally went live on April 24 in the US after the unexpected delay that came during the US tariff uncertainty earlier this month. And there were mixed results with how it went, to say the least.\n\nAway from Nintendo’s own invite-based pre-order system, three big retailers in Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, all launched their pre-orders at midnight on April 24. There was huge clamour for the product, and while some offered only the standard console and Mario Kart World bundle, others (Best Buy) crafted a whole heap of bespoke bundles.\n\nGameStop opted for going later in the day, releasing in-store pre-orders when shops opened, and choosing to put its online stock live at 11am. However, this method was - from our learned experience, at least - a huge disappointment. The interest was so high that GameStop’s website fully stopped working for large periods of time.\n\nAcross the board, it was a familiar story in terms of a sought-after hardware launch: some folks were lucky, and some folks were not. Here’s hoping it all levels out soon enough. The UK’s Switch 2 pre-order status is now less hectic, but readily available stock remains hard to come by.\n\n4. LG TVs became Xboxes\n\n(Image credit: Xbox)\n\nThis week Microsoft continued its mission to turn everything into an Xbox, with its latest efforts transforming your LG TV into an Xbox through its cloud gaming service.\n\nIf you have a WebOS 24 or WebOS 25-compatible TV (i.e. if your LG TV launched in 2022 or after, or if it’s a 2021 StanbyME display) you can install a beta version of the XBox app. All you’ll need then is an Xbox controller and a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.\n\nJust remember that because it’s all happening in the cloud the quality of your experience will be determined by the quality of your internet connection, so if your connection isn’t the most stable your LG Xbox gaming might be a little choppy.\n\nRead more: LG displays can now cloud stream Game Pass games without a console\n\n3. We got our hands on the new Motorola Razr Ultra\n\n(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)\n\nThe 2025 Motorola Razr family is here, including the new flagship Motorola Razr Ultra, and Motorola is tripling down on its commitment to unique CMF - color, materials, and finish. Besides the unique color options – all straight from Pantone’s color catalog – Motorola is making phones with unique materials like real wood and Italian Alcantara, and offering finish options that make the phones feel like nylon, Acetate, or faux leather.\n\nThis Razr is truly the antidote for boring phone design, and I had fun flipping through the different looks to decide which I liked best. Spoiler: it’s the Alcantara, which has a luxurious and soft feel; though it’s a toss-up between that Scarab color and the new Mountain Trail wood option.\n\nThe Razr Ultra is no slouch in the spec department either, and Motorola is finally offering flagship performance in its high-end model. Sadly, that comes with a higher price tag this year, but it could be worth the extra cost if the cameras and battery deliver on their promise.\n\n2. Insta360’s new X5 360 camera dropped\n\n(Image credit: Insta360)\n\nJust over a year ago, we declared the Insta360 X4 is the best 360 camera out there – and this week got a sequel with the inventively named Insta360 X5.\n\nThis new and improved model can record 8K 360-degree at 30 frames per second or 5.7K at 60fps – like its predecessor – though with a bigger image sensor it should deliver much better low-light image quality than the X4, and should boast better dynamic range at all resolutions to make the color of your shots appear more vibrant.\n\nYou’ll also appreciate the bigger battery capacity, efficiencies, and heat dissipation that Insta360 says result in the X5 boasting a 37% longer battery life and the device running less hot – an issue we know some had with the X4 before it. This means you should be able to rely on the X5 to record more of your adventures between charges.\n\nThe Insta360 X5 Standard Version costs $549.99 / £519.99 / AU$929.99, while the Essentials Bundle costs $659.99 / £609.99 / AU$1,109.99 and includes an extra battery, fast charge case, 114cm invisible selfie stick, standard lens guards, lens cap, and carry case.\n\n1. Adobe gave us a new AI-powered mood board\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nOne of AI’s most useful tricks is acting as a brainstorming sidekick – and Adobe has just launched a new tool that looks ideal for visual creativity sessions.\n\nFirefly Boards (which is the new name for ‘Project Concept’) is available to try now in beta and is an infinite canvas for moodboarding where you can use both AI-generated images and your own reference photos to come up with fresh ideas. It’s built for designers, but could also level up your birthday party invitations in a big way.\n\nThere’s a free version with limited credits, and you can join the waitlist now. We can see this one being a massive (and fun) weekend timesink."}

If you’ve ever wondered “what’s my DNS?” or why it matters, this comprehensive guide will explain everything you need to know about DNS settings, how to check them, and why they’re important for your online experience.\n\nWhat is DNS?\n\nDNS (Domain Name System) acts as the internet’s phonebook, translating human-friendly website names like “example.com” into machine-readable IP addresses that computers use to identify each other. Without DNS, you’d need to remember complex numerical addresses instead of simple domain names.\n\nWhy Should You Know Your DNS Settings?\n\nUnderstanding your DNS configuration offers several benefits:\n\nImproved browsing speed : Some DNS providers offer faster resolution times than others\n\n: Some DNS providers offer faster resolution times than others Enhanced security : Certain DNS services include protection against malicious websites\n\n: Certain DNS services include protection against malicious websites Access to blocked content : Alternative DNS servers can sometimes bypass regional restrictions\n\n: Alternative DNS servers can sometimes bypass regional restrictions Troubleshooting: Knowing your DNS settings is essential when diagnosing connection issues\n\nHow to Check “What’s My DNS” on Different Devices\n\nLinux\n\nOpen Terminal Type cat /etc/resolv.conf and press Enter Look for “nameserver” entries\n\nWindows\n\nOpen Command Prompt (search for “cmd” in the Start menu) Type ipconfig /all and press Enter Look for “DNS Servers” in the results\n\nMac\n\nOpen System Preferences Click on Network Select your active connection and click Advanced Go to the DNS tab to view your DNS servers\n\nMobile Devices\n\nAndroid\n\nGo to Settings > Network & Internet > Advanced > Private DNS\n\niOS\n\nGo to Settings > Wi-Fi Tap the (i) icon next to your connected network Scroll down to find DNS information\n\nPopular DNS Providers\n\nSeveral organizations offer public DNS services with various features:\n\nGoogle DNS : 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4\n\n: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 Cloudflare : 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1\n\n: 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 OpenDNS : 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220\n\n: 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 Quad9: 9.9.9.9 and 149.112.112.112\n\nWhen to Consider Changing Your DNS\n\nYou might want to change your default DNS settings if:\n\nYou experience slow website loading times\n\nYou want additional security features\n\nYour current DNS service is unreliable\n\nYou’re looking to bypass certain network restrictions\n\nThe Impact of DNS on Security and Privacy\n\nYour DNS provider can see which websites you visit, making your choice of DNS service an important privacy consideration. Some providers offer enhanced privacy features like DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) to encrypt your DNS queries.\n\nSummary\n\nKnowing “what’s my DNS” is more than just technical curiosity—it’s an important aspect of managing your internet connection effectively. Whether you’re troubleshooting connection issues, looking to improve performance, or concerned about privacy, understanding and potentially customizing your DNS settings can significantly enhance your online experience.\n\nSimilar Articles\n\nhttps://nordvpn.com/blog/what-is-my-dns/\n\nhttps://us.norton.com/blog/how-to/what-is-my-dns/\n\nMore Articles from Unixmen"}

This guide will explain everything you need to know about creating line breaks in Markdown documents.\n\nWhat is a Markdown New Line?\n\nIn Markdown, creating new lines isn’t as straightforward as simply pressing the Enter key. Markdown has specific syntax requirements for line breaks that differ from traditional word processors.\n\nHow to Create a New Line in Markdown\n\nThere are several methods to create a new line in Markdown:\n\n1. The Double Space Method\n\nThe most common way to create a line break in Markdown is by adding two spaces at the end of a line before pressing Enter:\n\n<span class=\"\">This is the first line.··\n\n</span><span class=\"\">This is the second line.</span>\n\n(Note: The “··” represents two spaces that aren’t visible in the rendered output)\n\n2. The Backslash Method\n\nYou can also use a backslash at the end of a line to force a line break:\n\n<span class=\"\">This is the first line.\\\n\n</span><span class=\"\">This is the second line.</span>\n\n3. HTML Break Tag\n\nFor guaranteed compatibility across all Markdown renderers, you can use the HTML\n\n<br>\n\ntag:\n\n<span class=\"\">This is the first line.<span class=\"token tag punctuation\"><</span><span class=\"token tag\">br</span><span class=\"token tag punctuation\">></span>\n\n</span><span class=\"\">This is the second line.</span>\n\nCommon Issues\n\nMany newcomers to Markdown struggle with line breaks because:\n\nThe double space method isn’t visible in the editor\n\nDifferent Markdown flavors handle line breaks differently\n\nSome Markdown editors automatically trim trailing spaces\n\nCreating New Lines in Different Markdown Environments\n\nDifferent platforms have varying implementations of Markdown:\n\nGitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) supports the double space method\n\nCommonMark requires two spaces for line breaks\n\nSome blogging platforms like WordPress may handle line breaks automatically\n\nBest Practices for Line Breaks\n\nFor the most consistent results across platforms:\n\n1. HTML <br> for Portability: The <br> tag forces a line break, ensuring consistency across browsers and platforms. Use it when precise line control is vital, like in addresses or poems. Avoid overuse to maintain clean HTML. 2. Double Spaces in Documentation: In plain text and markdown, double spaces at line ends often create breaks. This is readable, but not universally supported. Best for simple documentation, not HTML. 3. Test Before Publishing: Platforms interpret line breaks differently. Always test your content in the target environment to guarantee correct formatting and prevent unexpected layout issues.\n\nCreating Paragraph Breaks\n\nTo create a paragraph break (with extra spacing), simply leave a blank line between paragraphs:\n\n<span class=\"\">This is paragraph one.\n\n</span>\n\n<span class=\"\">This is paragraph two.</span>\n\nUnderstanding the nuances of line breaks in Markdown will make your documents more readable and ensure they render correctly across different platforms and applications.\n\nSimilar Articles\n\nhttps://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/\n\nhttps://dev.to/cassidoo/making-a-single-line-break-in-markdown-3db1\n\nMore Articles from Unixmen"}

The hardest-working character in show business always has a packed schedule, as most recently shown by her getting her very own airport in Japan.\n\nBut as always, Kitty-chan puts her fans first, and so instead of hopping in the tub for a relaxing soak herself, she’d rather help you enjoy that luxury.\n\nHello Kitty is part of the newest batch of additions to cosmetics brand Lush’s Bath Bomb line. The Sanrio star is even bringing some of her pals along for the Lush X Hello Kitty And Friends collaboration, but let’s start with a look at Kitty’s Bath Bomb.\n\nLush is being surprisingly coy about just what sort of fragrance the dissolvable bath salts have, only revealing that it’s for enjoying “a creamy, sweet bath time.” It sure does look cute, though, which is also important seeing as how you’ll probably want to use the Hello Kitty Bath Bomb as a decoration for at least a while before tossing it in the tub.\n\nOlfactory details are similarly scarce for the My Melody Bath Bomb, with Lush saying that it will provide a thoroughly satisfying “bath time that feels like you’re wrapped in pink clouds made of milkshakes.”\n\nThings are more concrete for My Melody’s self-professed rival Kuromi, whose Bath Bomb contains almond essential oil, benzoin resin, and cherry fragrance.\n\nRounding out the selection (though the flattest in shape) is the Cinnamoroll Bath Bomb, with a scent that’s sweet and fruity with vanilla notes too, and made with cinnamon and almond oils.\n\nThe cuteness doesn’t necessarily stop after the Bath Bombs dissolve, either. While Hello Kitty’s turns the water a milky white, My Melody’s and Kuromi’s will give you a pink bath, and Cinnamoroll’s a baby-blue one.\n\nAlso part of the Lush X Hello Kitty And Friends lineup are Sanrio-style Milk Bottle Bubble Bars and Friendship Cake Soaps…\n\n…Hello Kitty and Friends Shower Gel…\n\n…and Hello Kitty and Friends Perfume, with a sweet candy and orange citrus scent.\n\nThe bath bombs are priced at 1,150 yen (US$7.95) each, the Bubble Bar 1,860 yen, the soap 930 yen, the perfume 6,000 yen, and the shower gel 1,900 to 6,300 yen, depending on bottle size. They all go on sale April 24 at Lush physical stores and through the brand’s online shop here.\n\nSource: PR Times\n\nTop image: PR Times\n\nInsert images: Lush, PR Times\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

Bernie Sanders and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used a private jet to travel between Bakersfield and Sacramento, California, during their \"Fighting Oligarchy tour.\" Rating: About this rating True Context Neither Sanders nor Ocasio-Cortez own private jets — they chartered flights on a private jet. There were no commercial flights between Bakersfield and Sacramento, California, where the two held two separate rallies on the same day. Driving that distance would have taken around five hours, meaning the logistics would have been nigh-impossible to manage without taking a charter flight.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, the Fox News website published an article, titled, \"WATCH: 'Champagne socialists' Sanders and AOC spotted exiting private jet on 'Fighting Oligarchy' tour.\"\n\nThe article shared a video of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) deplaning from a private flight in Sacramento, California. The video was reposted by major right-wing users like Charlie Kirk and Benny Johnson, among others.\n\nThe story was also picked up by several outlets with known conservative biases, including the New York Post, the Daily Mail and the Washington Times. All articles and social media posts aimed to paint the duo, known for their left-leaning political stances, as hypocrites for taking a private jet as transport. Several alleged that the flight happened on Earth Day, April 22, 2025.\n\nSnopes readers searched the website in an attempt to figure out if the video was real. It was real, although the charter flight did not happen on Earth Day but on April 15. Additionally, their use of the private plane deserves more context than conservative media was willing to give the two congresspeople. Snopes contacted both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's campaigns but had not heard back at the time of publishing.\n\nThe 'Fighting Oligarchy' tour\n\nSince U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, Sanders has become one of the public faces against him, putting on rallies across the country and selling out large arenas, even in historically Republican areas (12,000+ in Boise, Idaho, which Trump won by 10 percentage points in 2024, for instance). Ocasio-Cortez has accompanied Sanders at many of the rallies.\n\nHere's what the tour schedule looked like on the days surrounding the private plane video, according to Sanders' campaign website:\n\nSaturday, April 12: Los Angeles, California. Special Guest Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Special Musical Guests Neil Young, Maggie Rogers, Joan Baez and more! Sunday, April 13: Salt Lake City, Utah. Special Guest Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Monday, April 14: Nampa, Idaho. Special Guest Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Tuesday, April 15: Bakersfield, California. Special Guest Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Tuesday, April 15: Folsom, California. Special Guest Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Wednesday, April 16: Missoula, Montana. Special Guests Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sara Nelson\n\nNampa is 20 miles outside of Boise, and Folsom is a suburb of Sacramento, for reference.\n\nThe only way to get from Bakersfield to Folsom that fast is by private plane\n\nBased on that schedule, the only way for Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez to attend their rallies in both Bakersfield and Folsom was to use a private plane. There were no direct flights between the two cities, and most routings on Google Flights estimated the trip would take at least five hours between flying and layovers.\n\nGoogle Maps said that driving between the two cities would also take about five hours. Assuming that the Folsom rally started late at night, the two would have needed to be on the road from Bakersfield around 4 p.m. afternoon, at the earliest.\n\nSince the rallies were held on a Tuesday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. employees in their intended audience, working Americans, would not be able to go to the Bakersfield rally without missing work. So, a private plane was the only option.\n\nFlight-tracking software found the plane used for the flight\n\nLooking through publicly available flight logs for departures from the Bakersfield airport, we found the plane, a Canadair Challenger 604 operated by Ventura Air Services, that made the trip to Sacramento. The flight history showed that the aircraft previously carried the two congresspeople between Salt Lake City and Boise and between Boise and Bakersfield. (A separate charter plane took the two from Sacramento to Missoula, then appears to have dropped Sanders off in Burlington, Vermont, and Ocasio-Cortez off in Washington, D.C.)\n\nThus, between the footage and the flight tracking, it is true that Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez chartered a private plane during the \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez did not own the plane — it was a charter\n\nThe Daily Mail's headline improperly implied that Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez owned the plane used and that it cost around $7 million. This is false — it was a charter flight, meaning the two did not own the plane.\n\nFox News, the Washington Times and the New York Post alleged that the plane cost about $15,000 per hour to charter. Snopes contacted Ventura Air Services, the charter company, about its own rate for the plane Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez used. A representative for the company told us he would not provide a quote on charter rates to the media, directed us to the company's CEO for comment, then hung up the phone.\n\nBut based on other sources, the $15,000 figured seemed a bit high — several charter plane websites suggested a rate of around $7,500 to $10,000 per hour.\n\nFox News reported that in the first quarter of 2025, Sanders' PAC, Friends of Bernie Sanders, had spent $221,000 on private charter flights across the first three months of 2025. This was accurate."}

Fuji, the best time to go is in the winter, when the weather is most likely to be sunny and clear. Alternatively, if you want to climb Mt Fuji, you’ll want to wait until summer, when the hiking trails are open.\n\nBut there’s also a great reason to plan your Fuji trip for spring, because that’s when you can catch a view of both Japan’s tallest mountain and one of its most beautiful flower fields.\n\nEvery year, a 15,000-square meter (161,459-square foot) area of Yamanashi Prefecture’s Fuji Motosuko Resort, located near Lake Motosu (one of the Fuji Five Lakes), turns a brilliant purplish pink as some 500,000 flowers come into bloom. In English, the flowers are called moss phlox, but their incredible beauty is more evocatively conveyed by their Japanese name, shibazakura, or “field cherry blossoms.”\n\nWhile the viewing window for regular sakura is painfully short, shibazakura linger in bloom for much longer. This year’s Fuji Motosuko Resort Shibazakura Festival started on April 12 and runs until May 25. It’s about three hours total from Tokyo to the venue, (approximately two hours by train to Kawaguchiko Station and then 50 minutes from there by bus to Fuji Motosuko Resort, so it’s doable as a day trip from the capital if you get up, or even if you sleep in a little bit, since the flower field is open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nDuring the festival a number of photo spots are set up, and while supplies last visitors will be given a cut-out art card that turns the shibazakura into a fashionable dress to take clever snapshots with.\n\nAdult admission prices range from 1,000 to 1,300 yen (US$6.90 to US$9) depending on date, but discounted tickets are available by reservation through the Fuji Motosuko Resort website here.\n\nLocation information\n\nFuji Motosuko Resort / 富士本栖湖リゾート\n\nAddress: Yamanashi-ken, Minamitsuru-gun, Fuji Kawaguchiko Motosu 212\n\n山梨県南都留郡富士河口湖町本栖212\n\nWebsite\n\nSource, images: PR Times\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

(NASDAQ:JMSB) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.30 on the 7th of July, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This takes the annual payment to 1.9% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nJohn Marshall Bancorp's Earnings Will Easily Cover The Distributions\n\nIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive.\n\nJohn Marshall Bancorp has a short history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at only 2 years. Based on its last earnings report however, the payout ratio is at a comfortable 20%, meaning that John Marshall Bancorp may be able to sustain this dividend for future years if it continues on this earnings trend.\n\nEPS is set to fall by 0.6% over the next 12 months if recent trends continue. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the future payout ratio could be 24%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.\n\nNasdaqCM:JMSB Historic Dividend April 26th 2025\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for John Marshall Bancorp\n\nJohn Marshall Bancorp Is Still Building Its Track Record\n\nThe dividend hasn't seen any major cuts in the past, but the company has only been paying a dividend for 2 years, which isn't that long in the grand scheme of things. Since 2023, the dividend has gone from $0.22 total annually to $0.30. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 17% over that duration. The dividend has been growing rapidly, however with such a short payment history we can't know for sure if payment can continue to grow over the long term, so caution may be warranted.\n\nJohn Marshall Bancorp May Find It Hard To Grow The Dividend\n\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. However, John Marshall Bancorp's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year.\n\nIn Summary\n\nOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, but generally we are not too happy with the payments John Marshall Bancorp has been making. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks."}

Politico posted an article noting Al Gore did this at a Climate Week event in San Francisco, and RealClearPolitics co-founder Tom Bevan tweeted with a smirk, “Gore says the same thing Democrats have been saying for a decade.”\n\nThe Democrats campaigned heavily in 2024 claiming Trump represented an end to democracy, and they lost the election. But it hasn’t slowed them down in the slightest.\n\nThe “independent fact-checkers” who act as a publicity arm of the Democrats never “fact-check” anyone calling Trump a “fascist” or comparing him to Hitler or Mussolini or Pol Pot or “insert mass-murdering dictator here.” PolitiFact screeches “Pants on Fire” when a Republican calls a Democrat a “socialist,” but “fascist” is always fair for categorizing conservatives.\n\nBill Maher’s recent dinner with Trump spurred angst-riddled articles on the Left. In The Washington Post, Mexican journalist Leon Krauze compared Maher’s dinner with Trump to journalists and politicians who were charmed in private meetings by Castro, Stalin and Mao. He wrote of New York Times reporter Herbert Matthews being in thrall to Castro.\n\nSo it was extra-special when The New York Times published an op-ed by Larry David, who loves making a friendly impression of socialist Bernie Sanders on “Saturday Night Live.” The title was “My Dinner with Adolf,” making an incredibly unfunny mockery of Maher meeting with Trump.\n\nIn his satire, this poseur imagined he saw Hitler laugh: “Suddenly he seemed so human. Here I was, prepared to meet Hitler, the one I’d seen and heard — the public Hitler. But this private Hitler was a completely different animal. And oddly enough, this one seemed more authentic, like this was the real Hitler. The whole thing had my head spinning.”\n\nOh, Larry is dizzy, all right. Face-plant dizzy.\n\nWhat was actually funny was Times deputy opinion editor Patrick Healy explaining why they accepted this drivel: “Times Opinion has a high bar for satire — our mission is geared toward idea-driven, fact-based arguments — and we have a really, really high bar for commenting on today’s world by invoking Hitler.”\n\nSo a president who’s been a great friend of Israel and who’s currently withholding federal money for universities with a nasty antisemitism problem is somehow today’s Hitler?\n\nHealy acknowledged “callbacks to history can be offensive, imprecise or in terrible taste when you are leveraging genocidal dictators to make a point.” But he claimed “Larry’s piece is not equating Trump with Hitler. It is about seeing people for who they really are and not losing sight of that.”\n\nFact check: False. Larry is clearly and imprecisely equating Trump with Hitler, just like almost everyone else on the Left.\n\nIn a 2020 interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Larry sang the same bitter notes about Trump: “The man has not one redeeming quality. You could take some of the worst dictators in history and I’m sure that all of them, you could find one decent quality. Stalin could have had one decent quality, we don’t know!”\n\nMany leftists scold each other for “humanizing” Trump, when apparently the proper thing to do is perennially dehumanize him. They can’t “normalize” Trump by admitting he might have one redeeming quality. They have more hope that mass-murdering Stalin was more redeemable. Then they assert they are the sanest ones, the ones not divorced from reality.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 CREATORS\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The recent update is the Roblox game's first licensed collab, and it's with a brand that rarely interacts with the platform.\n\nThe Roblox Fisch devs announced the event on April 26, 2025, via the game's Discord server, detailing all of the awesome features coming with the crossover. Roblox, as a platform, is no stranger to brand integrations and actively encourages its creators to get involved, but The Lego Group has stayed away from the metaverse platform for years, potentially due to its existing backlog of Lego games.\n\nThe Fisch Lego event adds an entirely new quest line, letting you catch and collect brick-built fish with a special rod, earn exclusive in-game rewards, and go on a quest to hunt down the Studalodon. The Brick Mutation effect also lets you discover classic fish with bold red, yellow, blue, and green patterns. We're not sure how long the event is set to last, but Fisch updates usually run for around a week, so make sure to dive in fast to make the most of this crossover.\n\nThat's not all the creators of Fisch have cooking up this week, as the developers also announced a collaboration with Madrinas Coffee. The Tropical Kraken Surge charged refresher is a limited-time beach-themed caffeine drink powder, similar to the likes of Sneak and Gamer Supps. Madrinas Coffee has partnered with other gaming brands like Cyberpunk 2077, Dead by Daylight, and Terraria in the past, but this is the company's first Roblox integration.\n\nIf you're eager to dive into this experience, make sure you check out our Fisch codes for some extra freebies.

You’re not alone. Many of us rely on note-taking apps to organize our lives, but without the right strategies, they can quickly become a cluttered mess. Apple Notes, often underestimated, is a hidden gem that can transform how you manage tasks, brainstorm ideas, and stay on top of your to-dos. With its seamless integration across Apple devices and a suite of powerful features, it’s more than just a digital notebook—it’s a productivity powerhouse. In this guide, Dan Rodriguez breaks down how to unlock the full potential of Apple Notes, helping you turn scattered thoughts into streamlined workflows.\n\nFrom creating reusable templates that save time to integrating notes with reminders for actionable follow-ups, this guide is packed with practical tips to supercharge your organization. You’ll discover how to categorize and declutter your notes, embed links and visuals for richer context, and even use advanced tools like handwriting recognition and cross-device syncing. Whether you’re planning a project, managing a grocery list, or brainstorming your next big idea, Dan’s insights will show you how to make Apple Notes work smarter for you.\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Apple Notes has evolved into a powerful productivity tool with features like templates, folders, and reminders integration to streamline tasks and enhance organization.\n\nTemplates save time and ensure consistency by providing pre-structured formats for tasks like grocery lists, meeting agendas, and project outlines.\n\nOrganize notes effectively using folders, headings, subheadings, and emojis for quick navigation and improved workflow efficiency.\n\nIntegrate links, save web pages, and attach annotated images to consolidate resources and manage complex projects within the app.\n\nAdvanced features like cross-device syncing, handwriting recognition, AI-powered suggestions, and math tools make Apple Notes a versatile tool for both personal and professional use.\n\nSave Time with Templates\n\nTemplates are a powerful way to simplify repetitive tasks in Apple Notes. By creating a dedicated “Templates” folder, you can store pre-structured note formats for recurring needs such as grocery lists, meeting agendas, or project outlines. Instead of starting from scratch, you can duplicate these templates to quickly create new notes.\n\nFor instance:\n\nA grocery list template might include sections for produce, dairy, and household items, making sure you never miss an essential item.\n\nA meeting agenda template could feature headings for topics, action items, and follow-ups, helping you maintain a consistent structure.\n\nUsing templates not only saves time but also ensures uniformity and allows you to focus on the content rather than the format. This approach is particularly useful for individuals juggling multiple responsibilities or managing complex projects.\n\nOrganize Your Notes for Easy Access\n\nAs your collection of notes grows, effective organization becomes crucial. Apple Notes allows you to create folders to categorize your content by project, topic, or personal interest. Within individual notes, you can add structure using headings, subheadings, and checklists.\n\nTo enhance accessibility, consider adding emojis to folders or notes as visual markers. For example:\n\nA folder for work-related notes could include a briefcase emoji to distinguish it from personal folders.\n\nPersonal notes might feature a heart or star emoji for quick identification.\n\nThese small visual cues make it easier to locate specific notes, reducing the time spent searching and improving overall workflow efficiency. Additionally, the search functionality in Apple Notes allows you to find content quickly, even within handwritten or scanned notes.\n\nStay Organized with Apple Notes\n\nDiscover other guides from our vast content that could be of interest on Apple Notes productivity.\n\nIntegrate Links and Save Web Pages\n\nApple Notes excels at consolidating external resources into your workflow. You can embed active links, such as websites or phone numbers, directly into your notes for quick access. The app’s share feature also allows you to save web pages, articles, or research directly into a note, keeping all relevant information in one centralized location.\n\nFor added versatility, you can attach images to your notes and annotate them. For example, if you’re planning a home renovation, you could save photos of design ideas alongside notes about materials, costs, and timelines. This combination of text, links, and visuals makes Apple Notes an invaluable tool for managing complex projects or brainstorming creative ideas.\n\nTurn Notes into Actionable Tasks\n\nApple Notes integrates seamlessly with the Reminders app, allowing you to convert notes or specific sections into actionable tasks. This feature is particularly useful for task management and follow-ups. For example, you can highlight key points from a meeting note and set them as reminders to ensure they are addressed promptly.\n\nBy linking notes to reminders, you create a system that keeps you accountable and organized. Whether you’re tracking deadlines, appointments, or personal goals, this integration ensures you stay on top of your responsibilities. Additionally, you can set priority levels or due dates within the Reminders app to further streamline your task management process.\n\nUse Advanced Features\n\nApple Notes offers several advanced features that enhance its usability and adaptability, making it a versatile tool for both personal and professional use. Key functionalities include:\n\nCross-Device Syncing: Access your notes seamlessly across your iPhone, iPad, and Mac, making sure continuity and convenience.\n\nAccess your notes seamlessly across your iPhone, iPad, and Mac, making sure continuity and convenience.

You finally put the last playing card in the tiger statue bought by the insane art-collecting chief of police and open the hidden door leading to the diamond-tipped cane that goes into the other weird mechanical statue, only to have a creature with a meter-long tongue drop from the ceiling and claw open your abdomen.\n\nIf the answer is more than zero, then you most likely appreciate a good herb. Now, thanks to our friends at Umbrella Corporation you no longer need to rummage around alleyway dumpsters and desk drawers to find them. All your favorite colors of herbs can be found at Capcom Stores and Cafes in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Sendai, or online for 864 yen (US$6) each.\n\n▼ You can tell a Capcom Store by all the Capcom stuff.\n\nFirst, recover some life with some Green Herbs tea, which is a blend of green tea and spearmint which is sure to refresh and invigorate.\n\nNext up, we have some Red Herbs that can finally be used on their own. This tea merges the flavors and aromas of hibiscus, rosehips, and a sweet touch of stevia. It might not serve to enhance other herbs this time around, but it sure will enhance your afternoon.\n\nBlue Herbs matches its unique color with the distinct fragrance of moringa and a hint of stevia. It’s a firm taste that’s meant to represent the poison-resisting effects of blue herbs.\n\nFinally, extend your life gauge with the classically clean and elegant chamomile tea which represents the Yellow Herbs of the game.\n\nUmbrella Corporation would like to kindly remind everyone that these teas should not be used in place of actual Resident Evil Herbs and there is no guarantee they can heal you from mortal wounds, treat/prevent poisoning, or prolong your life. Doctors are still your best option for all those things.\n\nNevertheless, judging by the reaction in comments online, many people are curious to try some of these. Many also had the obvious thought of anyone who’s played the games.\n\n“I wonder what it would taste like if I blended them together.”\n\n“Now I won’t have to worry about getting bitten by a zombie.”\n\n“Looks interesting. I want to try some.”\n\n“Seems like they would be more effective if I blended them.”\n\n“They should make some decorative herbs too.”\n\n“I usually only carry First-Aid Sprays.”\n\n“They should have come out with this ages ago.”\n\nMaking it so the teas could be mixed would have been a genius move for this product. That surely would have taken a lot of research and development to pull off though, so maybe if this run of Resident Evil Herb herbal teas is a hit, they’ll go back to the drawing board for that in the next edition.\n\nSo, be sure to clear out some space in that large briefcase you always seem to have but are inexplicably never seen carrying around to pick up these useful items. I usually ditch the flash grenades since I can never be bothered to use them.\n\nSource: PR Times, My Game News Flash\n\nImages: PR Times\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

What you can do is calm yourself, and the storm will eventually pass.\n\nCalmness is a human superpower. The ability to not overreact or take things personally keeps your mind clear and your heart at peace, which gradually gives you the upper hand in all walks of life. It’s a daily practice I’ve learned. Over the past several years, I’ve been cultivating calmness in myself — I’ve been taming my tendency to get riled up and argue with people when their behavior doesn’t match my expectations.\n\nAs human beings we all have an idea in our heads about how things are supposed to be, and sadly this is what often messes us up the most. We get frustrated when things don’t play out the way we expect them to, and when people don’t behave like they’re “supposed” to. We expect our family to act a certain way, our friends to always be kind, and strangers to be less difficult.\n\nAnd when reality hits us, and everyone seems to be doing the opposite of what we expect them to do, we get triggered — anger, frustration, arguments, tears, etc.\n\nIf you can relate in any way at all right now, it’s time to remind yourself of the truth: You can’t control how other people behave. You can’t control everything that happens. What you can control is how you respond to it all. Let calmness be your superpower…\n\nWhen you feel like your lid is about to blow, take a long deep breath. Deep breathing releases tension, calms down our fight or flight reactions, and allows us to quiet our anxious nerves so we choose more constructive responses, no matter the situation. So for example, do your best to inhale and exhale next time another driver cuts you off in traffic. In a recent poll we hosted with couple hundred new course students, overreacting while fighting traffic was the most commonly cited reason for overreacting on an average day. Just imagine if all the drivers on the road took deep breaths before making nasty hand gestures, or screaming obscenities.\n\nOf course it can drive us crazy when we don’t get what we expect from people, especially when they’re being rude and difficult. But trying to change the unchangeable — wanting others to be exactly the way we want them to be — just doesn’t work. So we’ve got to make some changes and lead by example.\n\nHere’s the way of being that I’ve been cultivating and advocating:\n\nTo breathe deeply and often.\n\nTo remind myself that I can’t control other people.\n\nTo remind myself that other people can handle their lives however they choose.\n\nTo not take their behavior personally.\n\nTo see the good in them.\n\nTo let go of the ideals and expectations I have about others that causes unnecessary frustration.\n\nTo remember that when others are being difficult, they are often going through a difficult time I know nothing about. And to give them space.\n\n“Being” this way takes practice, but it’s worth it. It makes me less frustrated, it helps me be more mindful, it improves my relationships, it lowers my stress, and it allows me to make the world a slightly more peaceful place. I hope you will join me…\n\nPractice Being Mindful and Calm\n\nIf you’re ready to feel more peace and less inner angst, here are some ways I’ve learned to remain calm and centered, even when those around me can’t seem to contain themselves. These principles reinforce the quick bullet points above, and when you consistently practice them, the world within you and around you becomes a lot easier to cope with.\n\nLet’s practice, together…\n\n1. Get comfortable with pausing.\n\nDon’t imagine the worst when you encounter a little drama. When someone is acting irrationally, don’t join them by rushing to make a negative judgment call. Instead, pause and take a deep breath.\n\nInhale. Exhale. A moment of calmness in a moment of tension can save you from a hundred moments of regret. Truth be told, you are often most powerful and influential in an argument when you are most calm. Others never expect calmness. They expect yelling, drama, defensiveness, offensiveness, and lots of back and forth. They expect to leap into the ring and fight. They are ready to defend themselves with sly remarks cocked and loaded. But your calm pause? That can really disarm them, and put you back in control.\n\n2. Think bigger.\n\nImagine a two-year-old who doesn’t get what she wants at the moment. She throws a temper tantrum! This small momentary problem is enormous in her little mind because she lacks perspective on the situation. But as adults, we know better. We realize that there are dozens of other things this two-year-old could do to be happier. Sure, that’s easy for us to say — we have a bigger perspective, right? But when someone offends us, we suddenly have a little perspective again — this small momentary offense seems enormous and it makes us want to scream! We throw the equivalent of a two-year-old’s temper tantrum.\n\nOf course if we think bigger we can see that this small thing matters very little in the grand scheme of things. It’s not worth our energy. Thus, always remind yourself to be bigger, think bigger, and broaden your perspective.\n\n3. Respect people’s differences.\n\nBeing kind to someone you dislike or disagree with doesn’t mean you’re fake. It means you’re mature enough to control your emotions and do the right thing. Period.\n\nAnd it’s absolutely possible to connect with, or even appreciate the company of, someone you don’t completely agree with. When you make a commitment to remain neutral on matters that don’t matter that much, and speak respectfully about your disagreements that do matter, both parties can remain calmer and move forward with grace. It’s a long process sometimes, but it’s worth it.\n\nSo just keep reminding yourself that what goes around comes around. No one has ever made themselves strong by showing how small someone else is. Just because someone does it differently doesn’t make it wrong. There are many roads to what’s right in this world.\n\n4. Find compassion and put yourself in their shoes.\n\nIn the busyness of today’s world people tend to be worried, fearful, hurting and distracted about everything. The word compassion means “to suffer with.” When you can put yourself in the other person’s shoes, you give them the space to regroup without putting any extra pressure on them.\n\nTruth be told, everyone gets upset and loses their temper sometimes. Remind yourself that we are all more alike than we are different. When you catch yourself passing judgment, add “just like me sometimes” to the end of a sentence. For example:\n\nThat person is grouchy, just like me sometimes.\n\nHe is so darn impatient, just like me sometimes.\n\nShe is being rude, just like me sometimes.\n\nAnd choose to let others off the hook when you can.\n\n5. Take things less personally.\n\nIf you take everything personally, you will be offended for the rest of your life. There’s just no reason for it! Even when it seems personal, rarely do people do things because of you, they do things because of them. You know this is true. You may not be able control all the things people say and do to you, but you can decide not to be endlessly distracted by them. Make that decision for yourself today.\n\nSeriously, there is a huge amount of freedom that comes to you when you detach from other people’s beliefs and behaviors. The way people treat you is their problem, how you react is yours.\n\n6. Create proactive morning rituals that start your days right.\n\nDon’t rush into your day by checking your phone or email. Don’t put yourself it a stressful state of mind that’s incapable of dealing effectively with other people’s negativity. Create time and space for morning rituals that get you moving in the right direction.\n\nHere’s part of my morning ritual: I take 15 deep breaths before getting out of bed, I stand up and stretch, and then do 15 minutes of meditation.\n\nI challenge you to try this — it has been life-changing for me — but start small with just three deep breaths and three minutes of meditation a day. Do this for 30 days. After 30 days, if this daily ritual becomes easy, add another two breaths and another two minutes to your ritual. When you begin a day mindfully, you lay the foundation for inner calmness and effectiveness, regardless of what’s going on around you.\n\n7. Cope using healthy choices and alternatives.\n\nWhen we face stressful situations, we are often encouraged to calm or soothe ourselves with unhealthy choices — drinking alcohol, eating sugary snacks, smoking, etc. It’s easy to respond to stress with unhealthy distractions. So pay more attention to how you cope with stress, and replace bad coping habits with healthy coping habits…\n\nTake a walk in a green space. Make a cup of green tea and sit quietly with your thoughts. Listen to some pleasant music. Write in your journal. Talk it out with a close friend. Healthy coping habits make a difference. (Note: Marc and I discuss this further in the Self-Love chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)\n\n8. Remind yourself of what’s right (and create more of it in the world).\n\nAt the end of the day, reflect on your small daily wins and all the little things that are going well. Count three small events on your fingers that happened during the day that you’re undoubtedly grateful for. For example:\n\nMy family and I made it home safely from work and school today.\n\nMy spouse and I shared a laugh.\n\nOur meals filled our stomachs.\n\nAnd then pay it forward — let your positivity empower you to think kindly of others, speak kindly to others, and do kind things for others. Kindness often brings calmness by allowing us to relish in life’s goodness. Create a few outcomes others might be grateful for at the end of their day.\n\n9. Practice letting everything and everyone breathe.\n\nAs you read these words, you are breathing. Stop for a moment and notice this breath. You can control this breath, and make it faster or slower, or make it behave as you like. Or you can simply let yourself inhale and exhale naturally. There is peace in just letting your lungs breathe, without having to control the situation or do anything about it. Now imagine letting other parts of your body breathe, like your tense shoulders. Just let them be, without having to tense them or control them.\n\nNow look around the room you’re in and notice the objects around you. Pick one, and let it breathe. There are likely people in the room with you too, or in the same house or building, or in nearby houses or buildings. Visualize them in your mind, and let them breathe.\n\nWhen you let everything and everyone breathe, you just let them be, exactly as they are. You don’t need to control them, worry about them, or change them. You just let them breathe, in peace, and you accept them as they are. This is what letting go is all about. It can be a life-changing practice.\n\n10. Establish and enforce healthy and reasonable boundaries.\n\nPractice becoming more aware of your feelings and needs. Note the times and circumstances when you’re resentful of fulfilling someone else’s needs. Gradually build healthy boundaries by saying no to gratuitous requests that cause resentfulness in you. Of course, this will be hard at first because it may feel a bit selfish. But if you’ve ever flown on a plane, you know that flight attendants instruct passengers to put on their own oxygen masks before tending to others, even their own children. Why? Because you can’t help others if you’re incapacitated.\n\nIn the long run, proactively establishing and enforcing healthy and reasonable boundaries will be one of the most charitable things you can do for yourself and those you care about. These boundaries will foster and preserve the best of you — the calmest and most capable version of you — so you can share the best of yourself with the people who matter most to you.\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nYes, it’s your turn to let calmness can be your superpower. It’s your turn to breathe in serenity, armed with the comforting knowledge that there’s no reason to let someone else’s behavior turn you into someone you aren’t…\n\nBut before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay.

A train on top of a truck, however, is unusual, but that makes it an interesting Lego build.\n\nCarrying trains is one of the specialities of British operator Allelys Heavy Haulage. The tractor is a German-built MAN TGX, specifically intended for heavy-duty use. The locomotive is a so-called Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0, built in 1952-53 in the UK. This particular example still serves with a heritage railway in the Scottish Highlands.\n\n\n\nThis project started about half a year ago, when I spent some time looking at British trucks to add to my ever-growing collection and to display at events in the UK. I came across photographs of trucks operated by Allelys and first built one of their rigs carrying a transformer. What I really wanted, though, was a truck carrying a steam locomotive. I figured this would be interesting, but I also wanted to display it at the Great Western Brick Show. This is held in a railway museum, housed in the former railway works in Swindon (UK). The event first took place more than 20 years ago. Back then, several train builders, all part of Brickish, displayed their Lego railway layout in the museum’s event hall. Nowadays, during the show, Lego builders fill the whole museum. Unsurprisingly, though, many visitors to the event like trains.\n\nThere are two reasons why I did not build it at first: I feared that a trailer for a heavy locomotive would bend ridiculously and I am not an experienced train builder. I used to love Lego trains when I was a child, but I have only built three train models in the last thirty years. What got me moving was finding a picture of this very truck carrying this type of locomotive. It looked doable.\n\nI started with building the MAN tractor unit. I have previously built trucks by DAF, Mercedes, Scania, Volvo and Iveco, so was happy to add another manufacturer. For any Lego truck that is supposed to look like a particular make and model, getting the look of the front end right is crucial. I built things sideways and upside down, but it works.\n\nIn real life, it is a big brute, with two steering axles and two powered axles. My model has working steering, with the front axles connected such that they steer at different angles. This may seem unnecessarily complicated, but positioning them at an angle adds to the realism. There is little space between the front and rear axles, so the tractor carries its fuel tank and equipment on a rack behind the cab. Building this, with all its little details, took hours of tinkering and I could not have done it without relatively new parts, such as small brackets and rounded tiles.\n\nThe trailer was the next challenge. The Ivatt Class 2 is fairly lightweight and quite small. This limits the length of the trailer, which makes preventing it from bending a bit easier. I also used a technique that I previously used for my combine harvester transport. The structural parts of the gooseneck are built with 90-degree angles, using plates mounted sideways. These connect to plates and technic beams that run down the length of the bed. It does bend a bit, but it does not look ridiculous. The deck on top of the gooseneck, above the tractor, is supposed to be sloped. I built this as a separate bit that sits on top of the structure at an angle. The real trailer has rails on top, but annoyingly, on my scale model, their length worked out to 36 studs. With Lego only making rails that are 16 studs long, that left me with a 4-stud gap to fill. I used tiles for this, that luckily sit in a location where they are not too obvious once the locomotive sits on top.\n\nI had built a small mock-up of the locomotive with the proper length and axle spacing, based on a sketch. But when the trailer was more-or-less complete, it was finally time to build the rest. Besides its relatively small size, there are a few more things that made the Ivatt attractive. At this scale, the diameter of its wheels matches that of available Lego train wheels. Furthermore, the diameter of its smoke box and boiler works out to close to four studs. This means I can use standard 4×4 round parts to build the cylindrical shape. Finally, this particular locomotive was built in Swindon Works, the very place where the event is held!\n\nThe model came together nicely and works well as a stationary model. However, I have designed it with running it on Lego track in mind. For that, I will have to remove the forward part of the cylinders, to allow the pony truck (with the front axle) to swing out. I am also in the process of building a tender for it that houses a train motor and battery box. I will go into my journey into Lego train building in a future article. For now, the locomotive looks pretty good sitting on my shelf.\n\nRelated"}

If you haven't done so already, you should start with the first article in this series, which covers Parts 1 and 2. It's important you're comfortable with the contents of Parts 1 and 2 before diving into the details of this article, which deals with Parts 3 to 7.\n\nThe journey I'm taking in 'Demystifying Decorators' is a step-by-step approach that's not rushed, with each step building in complexity from the previous one. Part 3 completes the 'Introduction to Decorators' segment. Part 4 consolidates knowledge with another example of a decorator. Then, Parts 5, 6, and 7 look at more complex uses and types of decorators, some of which are uncommon but still useful to help you understand decorators fully.\n\nLet's get started with Part 3.\n\nPart 3 • Using the @ Notation When Using Decorators\n\nLet's start with the final code block you wrote in Part 2:\n\nAll code blocks are available in text format at the end of this article • #1 • The code images used in this article are created using Snappify . [Affiliate link]\n\nA reminder that the last line, which uses .__closure__ , is there for demonstration purposes only, and you won't need to use this technique in real code.\n\nThis gives me an opportunity to briefly recap Parts 1 and 2.\n\nYou use a decorator when you want to add functionality to an existing function. Common decorators allow you to add logging to a function or time its execution. But there are many more uses.\n\nLet's break down the code above, and this will lead nicely to the main topic in Part 3:\n\nYou define store_arguments() , which accepts a parameter you call func . The function store_arguments() is the decorator. You can use it to decorate other functions.\n\nThe parameter func represents a function, which you pass to the decorator store_arguments() when you call it. The function you pass to func is the function you want to decorate. You also define inner() within store_arguments() . This is a function within a function. This inner() function accepts *args and **kwargs . Therefore, it can accept any number of positional and keyword arguments.\n\nThis inner() function calls func() within it, but it also performs some additional tasks. Recall that func is the function you want to decorate. In general, the inner function in a decorator can run additional tasks before and after calling func() .\n\nAnd inner() should also return the value that func() returns.\n\nAll this means that inner() is a replacement for func() since it performs the same operations as func() and returns the same value, but it also performs additional tasks.\n\nNote that inner() includes a reference to data , which is a list defined in the outer function. The function inner() has access to data even when store_arguments() has finished its execution. This is a property of closures, which we discussed in Part 1. The decorator, store_arguments() , returns inner , which is the decorated version of func . In the main code, you define my_special_function() and then you decorate it. The decoration happens with this line:\n\nYou redefine the name my_special_function so it now refers to the function returned by store_arguments(my_special_function) , which is the decorated function.\n\nYou can name functions anything you want, of course. However, it's common to see the inner function within the decorator function named wrapper or a name that includes wrapper within it. This highlights how this inner function wraps the original function within it. So, let's make this small change in name to align the code with the norm when dealing with decorators:\n\nLet's dwell on the line that does the decoration for a few more sentences since it's key to how decorators work and also to what's coming next. Apologies for the repetition!\n\nYou call the decorator, the function store_arguments() , and you pass the function you wish to decorate to it, which is my_special_function . You pass the name of the function without calling it.\n\nThe decorator returns a decorated version of the original function—the inner function inner() . So, in this case, this is a decorated version of my_special_function . You reassign this decorated function to the same name, my_special_function . Therefore, the name my_special_function now refers to the decorated version.\n\nThe @ notation\n\nBut if you've used or seen decorators, they were most certainly used with the @ notation. This is syntactic sugar that makes decorators easier to use, but it also makes them more obscure for beginners. But not anymore (after the following few paragraphs).\n\nHere's the line doing the decoration again:\n\nYou can remove this line and add the following line just before the definition of my_special_function :\n\nHere's the code that uses this notation to decorate a function:\n\nThe @store_arguments just before the function definition decorates the function. It's equivalent to the line you used to decorate the function until now, which is still shown as a comment in the code above to stress the transition from one way of decorating to another. The @ notation is just a shortcut to make decoration easier.\n\nWe'll get back to the \"longer\" way of decorating later in this article whenever we need to understand what the @ syntax is doing in later, more complex, examples.\n\nWrapping properly\n\nThere's another minor issue we can resolve in Part 3 as we complete the introductory part of this decorators journey.\n\nLet's inspect the decorated function, my_special_function() :\n\nYou add a one-line docstring to my_special_function() , which you'll use soon. Then, you pass the function to print() —note that you don't call my_special_function within print() . You also show the function's help text using the built-in help() . Here are the outputs from these two lines:\n\n<function store_arguments.<locals>.wrapper at 0x1043ac900> ​ Help on function wrapper in module __main__: ​ wrapper(*args, **kwargs)\n\nWhen you print the function to show the function object, Python doesn't show you my_special_function . Instead, it shows you what the name my_special_function actually refers to, which is the function named wrapper . And wrapper is a local variable in store_arguments() . This is correct, but it's not useful when using the decorated function. This hides the fact you're calling a decorated version of my_special_function() .\n\nThe help text also suffers from the same issue. It shows the function name as wrapper and shows its signature. The program doesn't display the docstring you added to my_special_function() , either. There's no useful help about my_special_function() .\n\nThis result comes from the fact that you replaced the original function with a new one that performs the same tasks plus a bit more.\n\nHowever, you can also pass the decorated function's metadata, including its name and docstring. This makes the decorated version even more like the original one.\n\nAs it happens, you need a decorator for this, which you can find in the functools module:\n\nThis decorator is one you haven't defined. It's part of the Python standard library. It's also a bit different as it has parentheses and an argument. You'll deal with this type of decorator in Part 5. The wraps decorator passes the func metadata to wrapper . Here's the output from the code now:\n\n<function my_special_function at 0x1028c0900> ​ Help on function my_special_function in module __main__: ​ my_special_function(name, repeat) This is a really special function. Trust me!\n\nThe function name is now displayed as my_special_function , and the help text also shows information about my_special_function , including its correct signature and the very useful, ahem, docstring!\n\nIt's a good practice to always use the functools.wraps decorator when defining your own decorators.\n\nSupport The Python Coding Stack\n\nPart 4 • The 'Limit Uses' Decorator\n\nI don't apologise for taking a while to get to this point. I didn't want to rush the introductory parts that cover how decorators work and the fundamentals of how to use them.\n\nBut now, we can consolidate these fundamentals with a new example, and we'll speed up a bit, too.\n\nLet's create a decorator that limits any function it's used on to only three uses. So, you can only call the decorated function three times. If you try to call the decorated function a fourth time, you'll get a message telling you that you've run out of attempts.\n\nSince you now know the anatomy of a decorator, let's build this decorator using a different order of steps from the ones you've seen so far.\n\nStep 1 • The decorator skeleton\n\nA decorator is a function that accepts one parameter, which you normally name func . And the decorator has an inner function, often called wrapper() . The decorator function returns this inner function:\n\nYou call this decorator limit_to_three_uses() . The wrapper() inner function always has *args and **kwargs as parameters to enable you to use the decorator on any function.\n\nStep 2 • The wrapping\n\nThe wrapper() inner function is called a wrapper since it wraps the original function within it. The wrapper() function is the replacement for the original function. Therefore, it should call the original function and return the same value the original function returns:\n\nYou call func() with *args and **kwargs as arguments. This means func() can be any function.\n\nStep 3 • The counter\n\nSo far, this code is common to any decorator. Now, you focus on the specific decorator that limits the number of calls of a function. You need to keep track of how many times the decorated function is called so that you can limit it to three.\n\nThe counter needs to be a variable that's available to all the decorated function calls. It's a variable that's shared by all the decorated function calls. Therefore, you can define it within the closure:\n\nYou define counter as a local variable in limit_to_three_uses() , but wrapper() still has access to it.\n\nNow, you can use counter within wrapper() to decide whether to call the function func() depending on how many times you've already called it:\n\nHope you noticed the 'Warning' in the comments. If you're using an IDE, it probably displayed a warning or some red squiggly lines to show you have an error. But let's not rely on the IDE and run the code to see Python's error messages. First, define a function to test this decorator:\n\nThis gives the following error:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last): File \"...\", line 23, in <module> print(do_something(5, 9)) ~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^ File \"...\", line 7, in wrapper if counter < 3: ^^^^^^^ UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'counter' where it is not associated with a value\n\nThe error is on line 7 when you use counter in the if statement if counter < 3: . The error claims that you're using a local variable that's not associated with a value.\n\nBut surely, you define counter on line 2, in the outer function limit_to_three_uses() . What's going on?\n\nThe error message provides another clue with the phrase \"local variable\". Note that the error is raised within wrapper() . Therefore, it seems that counter is a local variable within wrapper() . This wasn't a problem in the examples in Parts 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe issue here arises because of the following line within wrapper() :\n\ncounter += 1\n\nThis line is similar to counter = counter + 1 and, therefore, Python assumes that counter is a local variable within wrapper() . The name counter in wrapper() doesn't refer to the same object counter in the outer function, limit_to_three_uses() .\n\nWhen you write counter within wrapper() , Python first looks in the local scope, and since counter += 1 creates a local variable within wrapper() , the code raises an error since this variable doesn't have a value.\n\nYou'd like to clarify that you want to use the counter that's defined in the enclosing scope rather than create a new local variable within wrapper . Python refers to the enclosing scope as the non-local scope. And there's a nonlocal keyword you can use in the inner function to make sure you use the same counter in the enclosing scope:\n\nAnd the problem is now gone. This code works:\n\n45\n\nYou call the decorated function do_something(5, 9) , which returns 45 .\n\nHowever, to see the decoration in action, you'll need to call this function several times:\n\nAnd here's the output from this code:\n\n45 6 40 You've reached the maximum number of uses of 'do_something' None\n\nThe first three calls return the value you expect from the function. However, when you call the decorated function a fourth time, you get a warning telling you that you can't use this function anymore.\n\nNote that this decorated function doesn't return a value when this happens—or, more accurately, it returns None .\n\nOne final change to the code, which is not needed in this example but it's a good practice:\n\nYou use the functools.wraps decorator, as you learnt earlier in this article.\n\nPart 5 • Decorators With Parameters\n\nBut the decorator limit_to_three_uses() has some limits, if you excuse the pun. You can only use it to limit a function to three uses. Can we make it more flexible so that you can decide the limit each time you use the decorator?\n\nThe current definition of the decorator hardcodes the value 3 within it when you write the line if counter < 3: . Ideally, you'd like to pass this value as an argument each time you use the decorator.\n\nBut where can you add the new parameter to accept this variable?\n\nDecorator functions accept one argument: the function you want to decorate. When you use the @ decorator syntax, the function you define right after the decorator is passed to the decorator function as its argument. There's no place for another argument.\n\nA common solution to this problem defines yet another function with—wait for this—another level of nesting. Yes, you already have two levels of nesting. You'll add a third soon.\n\nLet's build this in steps.\n\nStep 1 • Some refactoring\n\nIn the code you have so far, the decorator is limit_to_three_uses() . Let's refactor this and rename the function using the generic and rather boring name decorator() :\n\nThe rest of the code is commented out for now since limit_to_three_uses doesn't exist.\n\nThe name decorator is not a very descriptive name. Neither is wrapper . Well, in a sense, they are very descriptive, but only in a general sense. They don't tell you anything about what they do in terms of the decorated function.\n\nBut that's OK because neither of these names will be exposed to the main code. The name wrapper is already local to the outer function, now called decorator . The name wrapper is not used outside the decorator. And the name decorator will also be removed from the global scope in the next step.\n\nStep 2 • A third function. An extra layer of nesting\n\nNext, you enclose the decorator along with its inner function within a new function. You can call this new function limit_uses() . This is the function you'll use in your main code to decorate other functions. It only has one parameter in this example:\n\nAlthough only one line is highlighted as changed in the code above, the rest of the decorator code has one more indent, too.\n\nSo, limit_uses() is a function that accepts one argument, limit .\n\nThis new function, limit_uses() , is technically not a decorator, even though many will call it a decorator. A decorator takes a function as an argument and returns a function. But limit_uses() takes an integer as an argument, not a function.\n\nHowever, even though limit_uses() isn't technically a decorator, it contains a decorator: The inner function you renamed decorator() . This inner function in limit_uses() is the same decorator you had in Part 4. Therefore, limit_uses() can return this decorator so that the decorator can be accessed in the main program:\n\nThere are two changes in this version:\n\nThe if statement within wrapper() now uses limit , the parameter you create when you define limit_uses() , rather than hardcoding the integer 3 . The outermost function limit_uses() now returns decorator .\n\nSo, limit_uses() isn't a decorator. But it returns a decorator. This makes limit_uses() a decorator factory. You can use it to create decorators with different limits on how often you can use the decorated function.\n\nYou can use limit_uses() in the same place as you use the standard decorator, like the ones you learnt about earlier. However, the function limit_uses() takes an argument:\n\nYou decorate do_something() by adding @limit_uses(3) just before its definition. Run this code. You'll see it gives the same output as the earlier version from Part 4. You can only run this function three times. However, you can pass a different integer when you use limit_uses() to set a different limit.\n\nBut why does this work if limit_uses() isn't a decorator?\n\nSo, limit_uses() isn't a decorator. It's a decorator factory. So how can you use it in the same place you placed decorators earlier, and it still works?\n\nLet's break this down by expanding the @ syntactic sugar notation into the fuller version. You can refer back to Part 4 if you need to.\n\nInstead of using the syntactic sugar with @ , you can write the following line after the function definition:\n\nThe decorator factory limit_uses(3) , which is a function, returns a decorator. Therefore, the notation @limit_uses(3) is equivalent to @decorator , but it also has access to the variable limit=3 .\n\nAs limit_uses(3) returns a decorator, limit_uses(3)(do_something) returns the decorated function since you pass do_something to the decorator returned by limit_uses(3) .\n\nTake a deep breath here before reading the following sentence. So, do_something now refers to the function returned by the decorator that's returned by limit_uses(3) .\n\nYou have a decorator factory that you can use in the same way as the standard decorator. Although limit_uses is technically a decorator factory and not a decorator, most people won't bother with the technical difference. They will say that limit_uses is a decorator that accepts a parameter. And that's fine with me—I do so, too.\n\nBut there's another way of achieving this functionality.

And in Python, duck typing rules. Duck typing tells us that what matters is not what an object is but what it can do.\n\nFunctions are callable. You can replace \"function\" with \"callable\" in the bulleted statement above.\n\nFunctions aren't the only callable objects in Python. Yes, classes are also callable. But so are some other objects.\n\nHold that thought. We'll get back to it.\n\nStep 1 • Creating a limit_uses class\n\nLet's create a class called limit_uses . I'm deliberately \"breaking\" the naming convention for classes with a lower snake case name. I want this class to be a direct replacement for the limit_uses() function from Part 5. It can be used like a function, so it's fine to bend the convention!\n\nI kept the code you used to test the previous decorator, but it's commented for now. The commented code is unchanged from the code in Part 5.\n\nThe class limit_uses has an .__init__() method that accepts one argument, which is assigned to the data attribute .limit .\n\nThis data attribute .limit —or you can call it an instance variable if you prefer—serves the same purpose as limit in the function-based decorator in Part 5.\n\nIn the function-based decorator, limit is a local variable in the outer function that's also accessible by the inner functions since they're closures.\n\nBut in the class limit_uses , an instance of the class has access to the data attribute self.limit . This is how classes work, after all!\n\nTherefore, limit_uses(3) now creates an instance of limit_uses with .limit having the value of 3 .\n\nBut in the function version in Part 5, limit_uses(3) was a function that returns a decorator function. Let's see how we can adapt the class-based version to match this.\n\nStep 2 • Creating a decorator within the class\n\nLet's rephrase the last thought in the previous section. You want limit_uses(3) , whether it's a decorator function (as in Part 5) or a class (as in this Part), to return a decorator callable. I used the term \"callable\" instead of \"function\"—it's more general, and it fits the duck typing philosophy.\n\nSo, you can make the instance of the limit_uses class callable by adding .__call__() in the class definition.\n\nBut you don't want limit_uses(3) to give you any callable. Instead, you want it to return a decorator callable. Recall that a decorator accepts a single argument, which is a function:\n\nSee the similarity? The .__call__() special method is equivalent to the decorator() inner function in the function-based solution in Part 5.\n\nThis decorator still has access to the limit value since .limit is a data attribute, and every instance has access to it.\n\nBut you also need a counter to keep track of the number of function calls. You need to keep track of the number of times the decorated function is called. Recall that wrapper() will be the decorated function when you complete this code.\n\nIn the function-based decorator, you relied on closures to ensure the decorator had access to counter . You don't need that now you're using classes:\n\nThe data attribute .counter can be accessed by any instance of the limit_uses class.\n\nFinally, you can finish off wrapper() , which is the inner function within .__call__() . The code in wrapper() is very similar to the code in the wrapper() function from Part 5:\n\nThe class limit_uses creates objects that are callable. And these objects are decorators since the class's .__call__() method follows the decorator pattern.\n\nSo, you can use @limit_uses(3) in the same way as you did earlier:\n\nYou can do this since @limit_uses(3) returns a callable that's a decorator. This code gives the same output as its counterpart in Part 5 when you defined a function-based decorator instead of a class-based one.\n\nWhich version do you prefer, the function-based version from Part 5 or the class-based version shown here in Part 6?\n\nPart 7 • Decorating Classes\n\nLet's keep this final Part brief. You've already covered everything you need to know about decorators. But here's one more bit.\n\nRemember this:\n\nA decorator is a callable that accepts another callable as an argument and returns yet another callable.\n\nUp to Part 5, all these callables were functions. In Part 6, the decorator was a callable object created by a class, but you still used this decorator to decorate a function.\n\nLet's now use a function to decorate a class. So, the decorator in this section is a function. But the callable you pass to the decorator is a class, and the decorator returns a class.\n\nI'll move quickly through this section.\n\nImagine you have several classes that don't have a .__repr__() special method, and you want an easy way to add it retrospectively. You can use a decorator. Let's call it add_repr() . You define a function-based decorator:\n\nPreviously, your function-based decorators accepted a function—you used the parameter name func . In this case, you'll pass a class to add_repr() , which is why you choose the parameter name cls . A class is still a callable!\n\nAnd a decorator should return a callable. In this case, you'll return the same class since you'll make changes directly to the class rather than create a new one:\n\nSince you want to add a .__repr__() method to a class that doesn't already have one, you can define a function that will serve as this special method:\n\nYou define a function called __repr__() . You can call this function anything you want since this is not the class yet. But you want to insert this function as a method in the class, so you use the name __repr__() to mirror the name of the .__repr__() special method. This is the same reason you use self as the variable name even though you don't define __repr__() within a class since you'll transpose this function into a class soon.\n\nYou create a generator called attributes within __repr__() using a generator expression that uses the attributes of the object. Then, you create and return a string using this generator.\n\nFinally, you assign this function to cls.__repr__ . Therefore, the class now has a .__repr__() special method!\n\nThe decorator is mostly done. Let's create a class to test this on:\n\nThis class doesn't have a .__repr__() special method. So, you get the default representation when you show the repr() string representation, which is not very informative:\n\n<__main__.SomeClass object at 0x104e55cc0>\n\nTime to decorate the class:\n\nThat's it. You simply add @add_repr before the class definition. Here's the output now:\n\nSomeClass(first='hello', second='bye')\n\nThis is the expected repr() string representation.\n\nYou pass the class SomeClass to the decorator function add_repr . The decorator returns the same class, but the class now has a .__repr__() method.\n\nOne last change, for completeness. If you use this decorator on a class that already has a .__repr__() method, the decorator will override the existing .__repr__() . Not good. Let's fix this:\n\nThe definition of the __repr__() function and the assignment to cls.__repr__ are now within an if block that checks whether the class already has the attribute .__repr__ .\n\nFinal Words\n\nThere's plenty to digest in this decorator tour de force. Depending on how new you are to this topic, you may need to re-read Parts 1-7 again in full or in part.\n\nYou may never need to write your own decorator. But next time you have to use the @ syntax with an existing decorator, you'll really know what's happening behind the scenes to give you the decorator magic!\n\nAnd perhaps you'll have some code in which you want to retrofit some functionality, or you want to flexibly add functionality to functions, and you'll reach out to decorators…\n\nImage by Erelsa from Pixabay\n\nCode in this article uses Python 3.13\n\nThe code images used in this article are created using Snappify.

Not so.\n\nToday’s Democrats are – there’s no other word for it – wacky. (RELATED: CARLY ATCHISON BIRD: Congressional Republicans Need To Move Faster Than They Ever Have Before)\n\nFrom embracing an illegal alien MS-13 gang member who engaged in human trafficking, domestic violence, and murdering and raping an innocent American mother, to fighting for men to be recognized as women (have you seen what’s going on in Maine?), to travelling across the country on private jets to “fight the oligarchy,” to cheering on and taking advice from far-left liberal activists who are committed to unseating their own incumbents, the Democrats have truly lost their way.\n\nAnd there’s no sign that they will return to normalcy any time soon, if ever.\n\nNew polling shows that socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is now more favorable to Democrats than Chuck Schumer, reflecting the larger trend that Democrats believe the party is not progressive enough. (Is that even possible?)\n\nThat explains why you’re seeing Democrat U.S. elected officials take the side of illegals over American citizens, like Rep. Jahana Hayes who said she regretted supporting the Laken Riley Act which requires illegals who commit crimes to be detained. Or Vincente Gonzalez who flip flopped on his initial support for the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a common sense bill that prevents non-U.S. citizens from voting in our elections.\n\nWhat has really gotten the American people scratching their heads is Democrats flying to El Salvador to push for the return of an MS-13 gang member who murdered an innocent Maryland mother.\n\nThe number one issue last November was the economy, and that remains true today. Rather than present policies that offer an alternative to President Trump and Republicans’ agenda to bring back American jobs and get the economy growing again (which seems to be working, albeit slowly) Democrats are spending time in El Salvador.\n\nThere is simply no good argument that will convince the average American citizen why members of Congress who are elected to represent Americans are using their time to defend an illegal immigrant who is a member of a now designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n\nWhere we will see this play out is in the midterms.\n\nGroups like the National Republican Congressional Committee are capitalizing on the moment, offering to pay for House Democrats’ plane tickets to El Salvador, so long as they promise to film their trip. The ads make themselves. (How many will use this video from Democrat Rep. Maxine Dexter?)\n\nDemocrats are betting their political future on a strategy that only works for the most leftist wing of their party. Will they ever return to normal?\n\nAs of today, outlook not so good.\n\nCarly Atchison Bird is the Founder and President of Bird’s Eye Consulting.

Orrick in Northern California temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order to withhold funds from cities and counties refusing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. While on Fox News, guest host Kayleigh McEnany asked Turley about the judicial pushback against Trump’s crackdown on illegal migrants, asking whether the president has the legal authority to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities.\n\n“Well, the astonishing thing, of course, is they’re now coming by the gross. I mean, we’re getting three a day. They’re increasing,” Turley said. “The Supreme Court has repeatedly said they want to stop national injunctions. They’ve tried to rein in judges a bit, including a judge in D.C. that should never have taken a case to begin with.”\n\n“But we’re now seeing three of these come down in a single day. The one in San Francisco, I think, is very problematic,” Turley added. “I think the judge pulled the trigger too fast. You know, this is a judge who said, ‘No, you cannot withhold money from Sanctuary Cities.'”\n\nWhile Trump has pushed for his second administration to fulfill his vow of conducting mass deportations of illegal migrants from the U.S., sanctuary cities in Democrat-led states have taken legal action against the administration. In response, the Department of Justice filed its own lawsuits, with Attorney General Pam Bondi suing places like Chicago, Cook County and the state of Illinois in February over their sanctuary policies for illegal migrants. (RELATED: ‘Could He Ever Be Deported?’: Laura Ingraham Clashes With Democrat Rep Over What ‘Process Is Due’ To Abrego Garcia)\n\nWATCH:\n\n\n\n“But the executive order told his cabinet, Trump’s cabinet, ‘I need you to look at this, evaluate it, and tell me if they’re interfering with federal enforcement, and then to withhold funds’. There’s a lot of runway between here and there in determining what they’re going to do. This judge just went ahead and said, ‘I’m stopping everything,'” Turley said.\n\nOn Thursday, former New Mexico Democrat Judge Jose “Joel” Cano and his wife Nancy Cano were taken into custody by federal officials for their alleged connection to an illegal migrant arrested on their property. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) said to the Daily Caller News Foundation that Cano was charged with “tampering with evidence,” while Nancy was charged with “conspiracy to tamper with evidence as part of an ongoing HSI-led criminal investigation.”\n\nThe following day, Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was also arrested by federal authorities after the FBI began investigating allegations that she helped hide a migrant charged with violence from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Suddenly, you hear a ding of an email coming through or some game notification that pops up on your smartphone? You are not alone. A new report from the UK found that distractions are one of the most common barriers to reading for pleasure.\n\nNearly half (46%) of UK adults surveyed said they struggle to focus on reading due to distractions around them. The figure rises to 55% among the 16-24 and 35-44 age brackets, and 52% for those aged 25-34.\n\n1 in 3 adults shared that they often multitask while reading, whether commuting, exercising, or doing household chores. For younger adults, this figure spikes: 48% of 25–34s, 43% of 16–24s, and 35-44s read on the go.\n\nThe report finds that overall, the number of UK adults who read regularly has dropped to 53%, down from 58% in 2015. When asked what’s behind this drop in reading focus, top causes in reading include a lack of free time, changes in mental or physical health, major life events, and changes in screen time or digital habits.\n\nKaren Napier, chief executive officer of The Reading Agency, says: “We’re living in a world full of noise – constant pings, feeds, and to-do lists. “Reading can be a lifeline, but only if we can carve out the headspace for it. Through initiatives like Quick Reads and World Book Night’s Reading Hour, we’re helping people rediscover the joy of uninterrupted reading – even if it’s just for ten minutes.”\n\nMichael Kozlowski Michael Kozlowski is the editor-in-chief at Good e-Reader and has written about audiobooks and e-readers for the past fifteen years.

Knowing little about architecture, though I’d like to think I recognize beautiful buildings when I visit them, I can now see how they’d qualify for this list of 11 of the most beautiful post offices in the world.\n\nDo you find it difficult to book award flights with your miles and points? I do! That’s why I turn to Point.me. They get me great deals and save me money and time.\n\nSee what you think, and I’m guessing there are a few post offices listed that you’ve visited.\n\nAny others you know of that should have been included? Let us know!\n\nRelated Articles:"}

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is Galliford Try Holdings plc (LON:GFRD) which saw its share price drive 144% higher over five years. The last week saw the share price soften some 2.3%.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Galliford Try Holdings moved from a loss to profitability. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. We can see that the Galliford Try Holdings share price is up 109% in the last three years. Meanwhile, EPS is up 104% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 28% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. This unenthusiastic sentiment is reflected in the stock's reasonably modest P/E ratio of 8.89.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nLSE:GFRD Earnings Per Share Growth April 26th 2025\n\nWe know that Galliford Try Holdings has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Galliford Try Holdings, it has a TSR of 209% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"}

But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Alerus Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ALRS) shareholders, since the share price is down 31% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 36%. Furthermore, it's down 11% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. However, one could argue that the price has been influenced by the general market, which is down 11% in the same timeframe.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring the three years that the share price fell, Alerus Financial's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 39% each year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 11% compound annual share price fall. So, despite the prior disappointment, shareholders must have some confidence the situation will improve, longer term.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNasdaqCM:ALRS Earnings Per Share Growth April 26th 2025\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Alerus Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Alerus Financial the TSR over the last 3 years was -22%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."}

But that doesn't undermine the fantastic longer term performance (measured over five years). Indeed, the share price is up a whopping 374% in that time. So it might be that some shareholders are taking profits after good performance. The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain. While the returns over the last 5 years have been good, we do feel sorry for those shareholders who haven't held shares that long, because the share price is down 30% in the last three years.\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n\nWe've discovered 2 warning signs about NZME. View them for free.\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nNZME has made a profit in the past. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. So we might find other metrics can better explain the share price movements.\n\nIn fact, the dividend has increased over time, which is a positive. Maybe dividend investors have helped support the share price.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNZSE:NZM Earnings and Revenue Growth April 26th 2025\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think NZME will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of NZME, it has a TSR of 625% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"}

Harvard is not only America’s oldest university; it is also the nation’s oldest corporation and also the first eleemosynary corporation, that is, one dedicated to charitable or benevolent purposes. Though now a secular university, Harvard’s 1650 corporate charter, which is still in legal effect, dedicates the institution to the pursuit of both “knowledge and godliness.” Many might argue that modern Harvard, having long ago jettisoned its Puritan roots, now pursues ungodliness instead!\n\nJohn Adams made sure that Harvard’s corporate status became enshrined in the Massachusetts Constitution. Chapter V, Articles I–III, deal specifically with Harvard:\n\n[I]t is declared, that all the said gifts, grants, devises, legacies and conveyances, are hereby forever confirmed unto the president and fellows of Harvard College,… according to the true intent and meaning of the donor or donors….\n\nCurrent debate has focused on whether Harvard’s recent actions are contrary to “public policy” as defined by the Administration. This relates back to the 1983 case, Bob Jones University vs. United States 461 U.S. 574 (1983), where the U.S. Supreme Court held that an institution receiving tax-exempt status must be “in harmony with the public interest, and the institution's purpose must not be so at odds with the common community conscience as to undermine any public benefit that might otherwise be conferred.”\n\nThe battle over “public policy” and whether Harvard may have violated it with regard to failing to deal adequately with antisemitism will continue to be played out in the courts and in the court of public opinion. But there is another issue that also deserves scrutiny, and that is the question of donor intent with respect to religion-based bequests to Harvard.\n\nThough now in the minority, there has always been a remnant of strong religious faith at Harvard. This was captured in Kelly Kullberg’s 1996 book, Finding God at Harvard: Spiritual Journeys of Thinking Christians. In 2023, Harvard Law School’s Program on Biblical Law and Christian Legal Studies (yes, there is such an entity!) sponsored a unique gathering of Christian alumni called “Faith & Veritas 2023.” This gathering, plus the establishment of the Veritas Forum, which was founded by Kullberg (who is no longer part of the organization), promotes Christian values and discussions about what faith means, especially on Ivy League campuses, beginning at Harvard. But not because the university was pleased to be a facilitator. With few exceptions, most such efforts or requests over the decades have either been shunned, sidelined or dismissed by ‘official’ Harvard.\n\nDonor intent is governed by a legal doctrine known as cy pres, where a legal authority attempts to determine whether or not an entity that has received donations or bequests has made every reasonable effort to fulfill the original intent of the donor. In 1898, a widow named Nannie Yulee Noble established the annual William Beldon Noble Lectures at Harvard in memory of her husband, who had been a divinity student. The bequest was very specifically intended “to continue the mission of her husband, whose supreme desire was to extend the influence of Jesus as ‘the Way, the Truth, and the Life,’” as well as serving as an “inspiration to Christian Missions for the conversion of the world.” The bequest’s statutes added that the “scope of the Lectures is believed to be as wide as the highest interests of humanity.”\n\nA person who attended some ten years’ worth of Noble Lectures at Harvard observed that she had only heard the name “Jesus” mentioned once in all that time. This clearly seems in contravention of the donor’s “true intent.” But by ostensibly using the phrase, “the highest interests of humanity,” Harvard has found a loophole to drive not merely a truck through, but an entire fleet of trucks! Over the years the lecture series has promoted a circus of causes that seem to have nothing whatsoever to do with the original intent of the donor. It’s not as if evangelical Christians have disappeared from the planet (although some in power at Harvard might wish that that were the case!), or that none of them have anything valuable to say in our day about Christian missions or “Jesus as ‘the Way, the Truth, and the Life’.” Instead, recent annual Noble Lectures have carried such titles such as, “Considering Hope in a Climate Crisis World” and “The Scandal of Mass Incarceration in the Land of the Free.” The 2024 lecture was given by a Zen Buddhist priest. Something seems seriously amiss here.\n\nOther examples could be cited, such as the Lentz Lectures or the use of Holden Chapel, as well as the use of Phillips Brooks House on the Harvard campus, built in 1901 to honor the Rev. Phillips Brooks (1835–1893). Brooks was a beloved spiritual mentor at Harvard and also the composer of “O Little Town of Bethlehem.” Funds were raised at the time from more than 500 donors. The building was to be used “without distinction of sect or denomination,” for all “forms of spiritual activity, benevolent action, and religious aspiration.” While Christian groups on campus have occasionally been given limited access to the building over the years, it has for the most part been granted only grudgingly. Once again, the donors’ “true intent” seems to have been lost in the process.\n\nHarvard is expert at “re-working” its interpretation of many of these bequests to avoid doing what most reasonable people would think as self-evident, and until now it has been too powerful to have to answer to anyone about it. As I wrote in 2008 in America’s Oldest Corporation, “Questions raised in the 1990s and later over how these bequests were being handled were treated dismissively by the University, which refused to turn over any detailed information after repeated requests from various parties.” A terse response from then President Rudenstine and Harvard’s General Counsel stated: “The detailed information you requested about these and other unnamed accounts would be extremely burdensome to collect and produce and will not be made available to you.”\n\nNow, however, in light of all the attention over Harvard’s antisemitism scandal and the current threat to its tax-exempt status, perhaps that situation may change. Harvard needs to be completely transparent regarding not only how U.S. government funds are spent but also give an accounting for how religion-based bequests have been dealt with in the past and what steps Harvard will take in the future to see how these bequests will be fulfilled according to their donors’ “true intent.”\n\nA.

That means it’s time to start putting away sweaters and coats and switch over to the fun, breezy fashions of late spring and summer, and if you want those fashions to be anime masterpiece-inspired too, there’s a whole line of Ghibli T-shirts going on sale.\n\nGBL is billed as the “American casual” line of Studio Ghibli apparel. It’s more accurate to describe it as classy, high-quality clothing with a dash of classic Americana aesthetics added to Ghibli’s artwork, resulting in things like this T-shirt with My Neighbor Totoro’s Catbus energetically meowing across the back with a rustic weathered look.\n\nLikewise, the “Good morning” shirt might look like it’s from a Michigan summer camp or Route 66 diner, but it’s actually recreating the scene from Castle in the Sky/Laputa when Pazu plays his trumpet at the start of the day.\n\nMysterious Creature may look a little spooky…until, that is, you realize that the shadowy mass in the center is actually the Big Totoro taking a nap.\n\nIf you’re looking for a proverbial deep cut in your crewneck, there’s this design that only true fans will recognize as the non-Catbus bus from My Neighbor Totoro.\n\n▼ There’s an especially cool touch on the sleeve, where you’ll find the sign from the bus stop where Mei and Satsuki encounter Totoro in the rain.\n\nSpirited Away fans have two designs to choose from, one with No Face on the front and frog spirit Aogaeru on the back at the nape of the neck.\n\nThe other Spirited Away shirt is a rare chance for Lin to get a turn in the spotlight, showing the hard-working big-sister type in the midst of a tempura rice bowl delivery.\n\nThings take a dark turn with the Princess Mononoke tatari tee, which not only shows the effect of the tatari curse on the infected forest creature…\n\n…but also shows that the corruption is infecting you, with ominous tendrils on the sleeve.\n\n▼ Of course, this won’t seem so detrimental to you if you’re already wearing that tatari ring.\n\nPivoting back to a more positive tone, the Howl’s Moving Castle shirt makes a heartfelt, starlit plea.\n\nMoving from one magic-steeped Ghibli film to another, Kiki’s Delivery Service also has two shirts, one with “Black Cat” writ large across the back with a rather stylized rendering of Jiji…\n\n…which might be part of the reason why there’s an explanation on the front.\n\nWhile Jiji may be Kiki’s best friend, she makes other pals too during the course of her anime, including budding artist Ursula. As a matter of fact, Ursula helps bolster Kiki’s spirits after the young witch loses her powers, showing her that flying brooms aren’t the only way to get around.\n\nFinally, rounding out the GBL Spring/Summer T-shirt Collection are two for Porco Rosso, one with Italian aviation mechanics wunderkind Fio…\n\n…and the other with sky pirate leader Capo.\n\nFittingly, the Capo T-shirt is the only one with a pocket, so that he can claim whatever you place inside for himself.\n\n▼ Stealing glasses that are of no use to anyone other than the rightful owner whose prescription the lenses match? Now that’s a real pirate!\n\n▼ The shirts all feature a tag with “Studio Ghibli” written in Japanese, plus a little Soot Sprite, on the back at the left side of the hem.\n\nAll of the shirts are made of 100-percent cotton and are priced at 6,930 yen (US$48). The entire lineup can be ordered as of April 26 through the online store of Studio Ghibli specialty shop Donguri Kyowakoku here.\n\nSource: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\nTop image: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\nInsert images: Donguri Kyowakoku (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

As the rollout progresses, users are encouraged to check their device settings for update notifications to ensure they can take advantage of these new features.\n\nWhy This Update Matters\n\nThe One UI 7 update represents a significant advancement for Samsung’s Galaxy ecosystem.
