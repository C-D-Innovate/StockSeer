This trial centers on whether Google has maintained an illegal monopoly over search by paying billions to be the default engine on browsers like Safari. Cue appeared as a witness for the DOJ, and his comments about declining Safari search volume and potential AI alternatives were part of that testimony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnalysts say don’t panic\n\nBut according to analysts at Jeffries, the selloff may be overblown.\n\nIn a note released late Wednesday, titled “Don’t Rush to Count Out Google Search,” analysts from the investment bank argued that Safari’s shrinking share is a limited threat. While Apple’s browser holds 17% of global market share, Google Chrome commands 66%, giving Alphabet a much larger footprint regardless of what Apple does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, daily active users of the Google app on iOS have climbed 15% year over year, undercutting fears of a broader user exodus.\n\nImportantly, Google’s search business remains strong: Revenue grew 10% in Q1, even with tough comps and rising competition. Google’s AI Overviews — a feature that condenses information for search results using generative AI — are also monetized at roughly the same rate as traditional search, Jeffries noted, suggesting Alphabet is adapting its core product without sacrificing profitability. The analysts argued Google should be able to improve these economics over time, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelloff making stock valuation more attractive\n\nAs to valuation, Alphabet now trades at just 9.7 times forward EBITDA, the analysts pointed out — barely above its 10-year trough and well below long-term averages. The stock is down 20% so far this year, underperforming the Nasdaq’s 6% decline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, while Apple may be exploring new partners, Google’s search dominance is far from over. “We believe the market reaction is excessive,” Jeffries conclued. “Reiterate Buy.”\n\nWhile the memo represents just one group of analysts, Alphabet shares already look to be recovering. The stock was up more than 2% before Thursday’s market open."}

The Trump administration intends to issue a revised version of the rule, which was set to come into effect on May 15. This process could take months to finalize, sources told Axios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe regulation in question — titled the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion — would have limited exports of AI chips to over 100 countries. These restrictions aimed to prevent countries from bypassing U.S. export controls, particularly in relation to China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChipmakers had criticized the rules, however. They argued it would give an advantage to Chinese competitors, such as Huawei, as they develop and sell their own AI hardware, foregoing an opportunity to ensure that much of the world would rely on American technology. The rule would have affected Nvidia’s ability to sell its high-demand graphics processing units, or GPUs, in markets such as India, Mexico, Singapore, and Switzerland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shift could reflect a relaxing stance toward regulating AI, offering a momentary boon for chipmakers. Since Bloomberg first reported the reversal on Wednesday, Nvidia and AMD stocks have gained 4.4% and 3.4%, respectively.\n\nBut any respite could prove temporary, and obstacles persist when it comes to accessing the crucial Chinese market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia’s most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100, are already banned from export to China, as a result of Biden-era restrictions.\n\nLast month the Trump administration also introduced new license requirements for less powerful chips by Nvidia and AMD in order to comply with export controls. Nvidia said these requirements on its H20 chips had resulted in a $5.5 billion hit to its quarterly earnings, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company’s earnings are scheduled to be released May 28."}

Some good news this morning: A cheap, widely-prescribed diabetes drug is showing some promise in preventing colon cancer .\n\nIn today's big story, Google's stock tanked after an Apple exec said AI engines are starting to challenge the search engine's dominance .\n\nIf you haven't subscribed to our new newsletter Tech Memo , what are you waiting for?\n\nWhat's on deck\n\nMarkets: Trump teases first 'major trade deal' — and it's set to be with the UK .\n\nTech: Big Tech is all about rewarding its stars and getting rid of everyone else .\n\nBusiness: People are fed up with companies' ' bait and switch pricing .'\n\nBut first, can you Google ChatGPT this?\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\nThe big story\n\nSearch and destroy\n\nGonzalo Fuentes/REUTERS\n\nAI giveth, and AI taketh.\n\nGoogle seems to be learning that the hard way, as the new tech is gaining ground on one of its crown jewels.\n\nApple executive Eddy Cue said searches on its Safari browser shrank for the first time last month, and he's pointing the finger at AI engines , writes BI's Peter Kafka.\n\nCue also said AI tools like OpenAI and Perplexity AI would eventually supplant traditional search engines, and Apple will offer them to Safari users in the future.\n\nGoogle investors took the news hard, with shares dropping more than 8% on Wednesday.\n\nCue has a vested interest in Google's search business, since Google pays Apple at least $20 billion a year to make its search engine the default on the iPhone . Still, in theory, Apple might be able to replace some or all of that money with payments from the OpenAIs of the world.\n\n(Cue's comments came while testifying in the federal antitrust suit against Google's parent company, Alphabet. When it rains, it pours.)\n\nThe AI boom obviously hasn't been all bad for Google. The interest in the tech gave it the green light to invest billions in new development. The results weren't always great , but it largely seems happy with the progress made on things like its AI Overviews .\n\nBut as much as it tries to reshape itself, the progress made by its younger, smaller AI rivals is becoming undeniable.\n\nillustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images\n\nIt's not just the new kids on the block enjoying the AI revolution.\n\nA very, very old player has newfound success leveraging AI. IBM is full speed ahead on its AI strategy, and Wall Street is eating it up , writes BI's Matthew Fox.\n\nThe company's stock is up almost 15% this year, far outpacing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is down 5%. At its recent conference, CEO Arvind Krishna said its generative AI business is now worth $6 billion.\n\nIBM's focus is helping companies adopt AI, and has the added benefit of an open-source approach. That allows it to work with clients regardless of the AI tools they prefer, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Matthew.\n\n(If you're looking for more tech coverage like this, subscribe to our upcoming tech newsletter Tech Memo .

The White House is expected to announce a trade deal with the UK on Thursday. A Downing Street spokeswoman told BI that talks between the two countries had been \"continuing at pace\" and the Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, would provide an update later on Thursday.\n\n2. No surprises from the Fed. The central bank held interest rates steady as expected, although Chairman Jerome Powell had faced calls from President Trump and members of his administration to lower them. Powell has stressed waiting to see how tariffs affect the economy.\n\n3. Jefferies banker's death ruled an accident. Carter McIntosh, a 28-year-old associate, died of a toxic mix of drugs including fentanyl and cocaine, an autopsy revealed . His death in January sparked widespread backlash against the bank's work culture.\n\n3 things in tech\n\nGetty Images; Tyler Le/BI\n\n1. Big Tech has a new playbook. Tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are doubling down on performance-based rewards , with top performers receiving larger payouts and low performers facing the heat. Meanwhile, new-hire offers are being reduced.\n\n2. How a meme empire is sliding into your DMs. The Instagram gold rush isn't in the grid anymore — it's in your DMs. Doing Things, the company that owns meme accounts like Overheard, told BI its strategy to get users to share its content.\n\n3. Meet Valarian, a new addition from the Palantir mafia. The Palantir-alumni-founded startup wants to help governments and companies control their data and has plans to expand into the defense sector. Its current seed round has raised $20 million .\n\n3 things in business\n\nCayce Clifford for BI\n\n1. Pro-Tesla, anti-Musk. Working for Tesla was Matthew LaBrot's dream job, but he was fired after publishing a website protesting Elon Musk. In an interview with BI, he shared his concern for how the billionaire is affecting Tesla's brand and sales — and why he still believes in the company anyway.\n\n2. Recession fears got nothing on Disney adults. They know a Disney vacation is pricey, but they're going anyway. Disney World visits are surging , US parks revenue soared last quarter, and soon, they'll have a new magical destination to add to the list: Abu Dhabi .\n\n3. Does $19.95 to rent a U-Haul truck sound too good to be true? That's because it is. Companies are using \"bait-and-switch\" tactics to lure customers in with one price, only to tack on extra fees and make the total nowhere near what was initially expected. It's so common that customers often throw their hands up and pay anyway .\n\nIn other news\n\nWhat's happening today\n\nParamount, News Corp, Coinbase, and Lyft report earnings.\n\nThe Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

"AIエージェントの登場はAI革命の根本的な転換点となるもので、「あなたと会話するAI」から、かつてないほどの自律性を備えた「あなたの代理で仕事をするAI」へと進化しました。\n\n\n\n何十年もの間、盤石な企業システムとのインタラクションには、多岐にわたる複雑なインターフェースに対応するための専門知識が必要でした。AIエージェントは、AIの能力を活用するための障壁を下げるものです。対話型インターフェースを介したインタラクションを可能にすることで、ユーザーは目標を設定するだけで、エージェントのネットワークがバックエンドの企業システム全体で必要なアクションを実行します。このようなテクノロジーの民主化は、技術的な専門知識の有無にかかわらず、すべての人がAIを活用して、人事、財務、IT、カスタマー・サービスといった部門の複雑なタスクを自動化し、洞察を得て、生産性を向上させることができることを示唆しています。\n\n\n\n私たちは、この新しい運用モデルは、生成AIに期待される大きな経済的可能性を促進するカタリスト（触媒）になると確信しています。McKinsey社によると、生成AIは業界全体で年間4兆4,000億米ドルの経済価値を生み出すと試算されています。\n\n\n\nしかし、それを実現するためには、今日の複雑なエンタープライズ・テクノロジー・スタックを支える膨大なアプリケーション、データ、システムの網の中で、エージェントがシームレスに動作できなければなりません。つまり、オーケストレーション、統合、自動化こそが、エージェントを目新しい技術から実用へと移行させる切り札なのです。\n\n\n\nそのため、IBMはエージェントを開発するだけでなく、エージェント時代を支える基礎となるテクノロジー・スタックを再構築しています。\n\n\n\nIBMの戦略は、企業が持つあらゆるデータを活用して、あらゆるインフラストラクチャー上のあらゆるテクノロジーでエージェントを活用できるよう支援することです。IBMのポートフォリオは、Adobe社、Microsoft社、Oracle社、ServiceNow社、Workday社が提供するテクノロジーを含む既存のIT資産を活用しながら、Salesforce社のAgentforceのようなあらゆるベンダーやプラットフォームのエージェントをオーケストレーションできるようにします。また、あらかじめ構築されたエージェントやツール、統合により、迅速に実行することができます。\n\n\n\nIBMは本日、エージェントの構築、運用、管理を支援する、業界で最も包括的なエージェント機能群を発表しました。これらはすべて、watsonx

5分でエージェントを構築できるノーコード・ツールから、開発者向けのプロコード・ツールまで、エージェントの構築、カスタマイズ、デプロイのプロセスを簡素化します。\n\nエージェント・オーケストレーション ： 複数のエージェントを統合し自動化することで、複雑なタスクに対応し、エージェントとアシスタントがあらゆるツール、データソース、インフラストラクチャーで連携できるようにします。\n\nエージェントのオブザーバビリティー（可観測性）：企業全体のエージェントの使用状況を検出、監視、最適化し、信頼性、パフォーマンス、効率性を向上させます。\n\n\n\nこの戦略の中核となるのが、IBM watsonx

Orchestrateは、企業全体にわたって作業をオーケストレーションするための統合ソリューションで、マルチエージェントのスーパーバイザー、ルーター、プランナーとして機能し、IBM製、サード・パーティー製、オープンソースを問わず、エージェント同士や既存の資産（従来の自動化、AIアシスタント、API、データ・ストア、アプリケーション）との効果的なコラボレーションを可能にします。80以上の主要なエンタープライズ・アプリケーションと事前に統合されているため、ベンダー・ロックインに陥ることなくエンタープライズ・スタック全体にエージェントを浸透させるための理想的なゲートウェイとなります。\n\n\n\n事前構築されたエージェントとツールで導入を迅速化\n\nIBMは、生産性向上の主要なターゲットであるビジネス機能において、特定の専門知識と性能を備えた事前構築済みエージェントを提供します。最初に導入される領域特化型エージェントは以下の通りです。\n\n関連動画はこちらをご覧ください。\n\n今後は、カスタマーケアや財務といった領域に特化したエージェントを追加展開する予定です。また、専門領域に特化したエージェントだけでなく、ウェブ調査や計算のようなタスク向けにシステム内に組み込むことができる一般的なユーティリティー・エージェントも幅広く開発しています。\n\n\n\nIBM や他のベンダーのエージェントへのアクセスを簡素化するために、watsonx Orchestrate[3]のAgent Catalogを発表しました。 このカタログは、IBM やパートナー企業の膨大なエコシステムから提供される何百もの構築済みツールやエージェントにアクセスするための出発点として機能するもので、すでに150以上が用意されています。初期の例としては[4]、効果的な見込み客開拓と販売コンバージョン率向上のためのツールと知識を販売者に提供するSalesforce社の販売見込み客開拓エージェントや、Slackの対話型インターフェースを介して従業員からの問い合わせに対応する、Slackに組み込むことができる人事エージェントなどがあります。\n\nまた、watsonx Orchestrate を使用して IBMの パートナー企業が直接構築できるようにする新しいプログラムも開始し、パートナーが構築したアプリのポートフォリオをさらに迅速かつ簡単に拡大できるようにします。\n\n\n\n数分で独自のエージェントを構築\n\nIBMはまた、CrewAI、LangGraph、IBM Beeのようなオープンソースのエージェント・フレームワークを含む、あらゆるフレームワークやアーキテクチャーを使用して、企業が幅広いスキルセットに対応する独自のエージェントを構築、統合、カスタマイズできるよう支援することにも注力しています。\n\n\n\n本日よりパブリック・プレビューが開始された新しい watsonx Orchestrate Agent Builder[5] は、Agent Catalogに掲載されている構築済みのエージェントやツールを利用して、5 分で独自のエージェントを設計できるノーコードの自動化スタジオをお客様に提供します。このスタジオは、エージェント構築のプロセスを民主化し、組織の誰もが、何百もの構築済みツールを活用して、ビジネス知識に基づいた洗練されたエージェントを簡単に構築、展開、管理できるようにします。\n\n関連動画はこちらをご覧ください。\n\nコントロールと柔軟性を必要とする開発者のために、カスタム AI エージェントを構築、評価、展開するための幅広いプロコードのツールセットと、ソフトウェア開発キットを提供します。これには、高度に専門化されたエージェントをゼロから構築し、手元のパソコンから watsonx Orchestrate に直接デプロイするための新しいエージェント開発キット (Agent development kit：ADK) が含まれます。また、事前構築済みの一連のツールとコア・ビジネス・アプリケーションとの統合に加え、AI エージェントが何千もの既存のツールと簡単に統合できるように、モデル・コンテキスト・プロトコル（Model Context Protocol ：MCP）を完全にサポートすることで、エージェントの接続性を拡張しています。\n\nベンダーを超えたマルチエージェントとのコラボレーションのためのオーケストレーション\n\n企業におけるAIエージェントの真の力は、それらが協調して動作することで発揮されます。エージェントがさらに複雑なお客様内のプロジェクトに対応できるように進化するにつれ、重要なビジネス・ワークフロー内およびワークフロー間でエージェントが連携できるようにするために、オーケストレーション機能が不可欠になります。\n\n\n\nこのような認識のもと、私たちは watsonx Orchestrate にマルチエージェント・オーケストレーション機能を追加し、単純なタスク・ルーティングにとどまらない、高度なエージェント間コラボレーションを可能にしました。これにより、IBM製、パートナー製、オープンソースを問わず、特化したエージェントが情報を共有し、複雑なマルチ・ステップのプロセスに共同で取り組むことが可能になります。企業はこれらの機能をエージェント・システムに組み込むことで、ユーザーのリクエストを分析し、適切なエージェント、アシスタント、スキルにリアルタイムで指示をルーティングすることができます。\n\n\n\nしかし、効果的なオーケストレーションとは、単にエージェントをオーケストレーションするだけではなく、テクノロジー環境全体を活用することでもあります。そのため、watsonx Orchestrate は、エージェント間のコラボレーションや、既存のテクノロジー投資（自動化、API、データソース、コア・アプリケーション）とのコラボレーションを可能にします。これにより、エージェントは単独で機能するのではなく、企業のビジネス・オペレーションの中で付加価値として機能します。\n\n\n\n効果的で責任ある採用のためのエージェントのオブザーバビリティー\n\nエージェントが急増し始めるにつれて、ますます自律的になるシステムを効果的かつ責任を持って導入するためにエージェントのオブザーバビリティー向けツールが不可欠となります。これには、企業全体でエージェントを検出、管理、監視、最適化する機能が含まれます。\n\n\n\nIBMのwatsonxポートフォリオは、AIのパフォーマンスと信頼性を監視し、AIのガードレールを適用し、AIリソースを効果的に拡張するための堅牢なツール群を提供します。例えば、企業がコスト効率やパフォーマンスなどの特定の目標に基づいて、使用するAIモデルを評価・選択できるようにするツールがあります。また、エージェントやツールの検出とオーケストレーションを支援するツールも開発しており、タスクの設計と実行をより効果的に行えるようにします。さらに、業界をリードするIBMのAIガバナンス機能により、企業のエージェント・システムの可視性と制御性を高め、精度、パフォーマンス、リスクの管理を支援します。\n\n\n\n今日からエージェントを活用\n\nAIエージェントやアシスタントの構築、導入、管理を支援するIBMの製品について詳しくは以下をご覧ください。\n\nwatsonx

Its design echoes the original PowerBook 100. Even years later, it remains a cult favorite among many Mac users.\n\nPowerBook 2400c: Impressively thin, powerful Apple laptop\n\nToday, a 4.4-pound laptop doesn’t sound particularly impressive. The modern MacBook Air weighs less than 3 pounds, making the PowerBook 2400c seem chunky by comparison. However, it came in at about half the weight of most laptops in the late 1990s. That made it an impressive engineering feat from Apple.\n\nDespite its thin profile, the PowerBook 2400c proved surprisingly powerful. Manufactured by Apple’s old rival IBM, it came with PCI-based architecture with a 180 MHz PowerPC 603e processor and 256KB of Level 2 cache. This allowed it to run the standard business applications of the time almost as well as the PowerBook 3400c, which Apple called “the fastest notebook computer in the world.”\n\nThat software looked good on the PowerBook 2400c’s 800×600, 10.4-inch active matrix TFT display. The graphics were a step above what many laptops offered at the time.\n\nThe computer also boasted a 1.3GB IDE hard drive and 16MB of RAM (expandable to 48MB). Its lithium-ion battery delivered two to four hours of use between charges.\n\nPlenty of ports and expandability\n\nThe PowerBook 2400c came with a decent array of ports, too, including one Apple Desktop Bus, one serial port, one audio out, one audio in and one HD1–30 SCSI connection, along with the onboard Mini–15 display connector.\n\nIt also packed two Type I/II PC Card slots and the option for a double-high Type III PC card for added expandability.\n\nLater, when other Apple laptops of the era became outdated, this level of expandability gave users access to everything from USB and FireWire to Ethernet and wireless networking.\n\n… but no CD-ROM or built-in floppy drive\n\nAs with any lightweight laptop, however, Apple made some compromises. To achieve the PowerBook 2400c’s thin form factor, Apple ditched the CD-ROM drive and internal floppy drive. However, the laptop came with an external floppy.\n\nNonetheless, the level of expandability made the PowerBook 2400c a computer that lived well beyond a few years. It came preloaded with the popular Mac OS 8, but with the correct modifications, it could run anything from System 7 to 2002’s Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar. Apple’s first thin laptop was particularly well-liked in Japan, where people favored lightweight laptops long before Western consumers did.\n\nSteve Jobs kills the PowerBook 2400c\n\nSadly, this thin and light laptop didn’t survive the wrath of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. When he returned to Apple in 1997 and subsequently assumed full control (he took over as interim CEO just two months after the PowerBook 2400c was released), he began scrapping projects to streamline Apple’s offerings.\n\nBy the following year, Apple had just four major products: the iMac, the Power Macintosh G3 and the PowerBook G3 series laptops. Jobs kicked the PowerBook 2400c to the curb in March 1998.\n\nDo you remember Apple’s first thin-and-light laptop? Leave your comments below."}

The Trump administration intends to issue a revised version of the rule, which was set to come into effect on May 15. This process could take months to finalize, sources told Axios.\n\nThe regulation in question — titled the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion — would have limited exports of AI chips to over 100 countries. These restrictions aimed to prevent countries from bypassing U.S. export controls, particularly in relation to China.\n\nChipmakers had criticized the rules, however. They argued it would give an advantage to Chinese competitors, such as Huawei, as they develop and sell their own AI hardware, foregoing an opportunity to ensure that much of the world would rely on American technology. The rule would have affected Nvidia’s ability to sell its high-demand graphics processing units, or GPUs, in markets such as India, Mexico, Singapore, and Switzerland.\n\nThe shift could reflect a relaxing stance toward regulating AI, offering a momentary boon for chipmakers. Since Bloomberg first reported the reversal on Wednesday, Nvidia and AMD stocks have gained 4.4% and 3.4%, respectively.\n\nBut any respite could prove temporary, and obstacles persist when it comes to accessing the crucial Chinese market.\n\nNvidia’s most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100, are already banned from export to China, as a result of Biden-era restrictions.\n\nLast month the Trump administration also introduced new license requirements for less powerful chips by Nvidia and AMD in order to comply with export controls. Nvidia said these requirements on its H20 chips had resulted in a $5.5 billion hit to its quarterly earnings, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company’s earnings are scheduled to be released May 28.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."}

The news heightened concerns that AI is chipping away at Google’s bread-and-butter online search business.\n\nAlphabet shares have slumped 20% since the start of the year through Wednesday’s close, in part over concerns that an economic slowdown could hit revenue as ad spending is reined in. The stock fell more than 7% to close near $151 on Wednesday.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at Alphabet’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify major price levels worth watching out for.\n\nRising Wedge Breakdown\n\nFollowing an ominous death cross surfacing on the chart last month, Alphabet shares staged a countertrend rally to form a rising wedge, a bearish pattern that indicates a continuation of the stock’s move lower.\n\nIndeed, that move looks to have started in Wednesday’s trading session, with the price breaking down below the pattern’s lower trendline on above-average daily volume. Moreover, the drop coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) plunging below the 50 threshold, signaling accelerating selling momentum.\n\nLet’s identify two major support levels on Alphabet’s chart where the shares may attract support and also locate key overhead areas worth watching during future recovery efforts.\n\nMajor Support Levels to Monitor\n\nThe first support level to watch sits around $141. This area could attract buying interest near a horizontal line that connects last month’s prominent low with several peaks that developed on the chart in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSelling below this major technical level could see the shares retreat to lower support at $131. Investors may seek entry points in this region near the low of a pullback to the closely watched 200-day moving average in March last year.\n\nKey Overhead Areas Worth Watching\n\nDuring recovery efforts in the stock, it’s worth keeping track of the $165 area. The shares may encounter overhead resistance at this level near the rising wedge pattern’s peak, which also closely aligns with last November’s trough.\n\nFinally, a close above this area could propel a move to $182. Investors who have accumulated Alphabet shares at lower levels may look for profit-taking opportunities in this region near a trendline that links a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to late June last year.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

The Commerce Department confirmed the regulatory shift after Wednesday's closing bell, saying Biden's AI rule was \"overly complex\" and \"overly bureaucratic.\"\n\n\"We will be replacing it with a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance,\" a spokesperson told Yahoo Finance in an email late Wednesday.\n\nAfter rising as much as 1.4% early Thursday, Nvidia shares ended the trading day roughly flat.\n\nNvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock also gained nearly 2% on Wednesday and rose an as much as 5% Thursday before paring gains. AMD shares ended Thursday up 1.3%.\n\nRead more about Nvidia stock and today's market action.\n\nThe Biden-era rule, known as the AI diffusion rule, uses a tiered system to cap the amount of AI chips that could be exported to key US trading partners in an attempt to thwart chip smuggling to China through other countries. It also significantly limits the ability of US companies to expand their AI data center capacity abroad.\n\nBiden imposed the rule in January in his final days in office. It was set to go into effect in May.\n\nThe Commerce Department did not respond to follow-up questions about specific changes it would make to the former policy.\n\nBig Tech companies, including Nvidia, had called on Trump to scrap the regulations, with the chipmaker's vice president of government affairs Ned Finkle calling it an attempt \"to rig market outcomes and stifle competition.\"\n\nConsequently, Wednesday's news offered a welcome reprieve for Nvidia and AMD after other Trump trade policies helped push their stocks down about 13% and 17%, respectively, in 2025. The stocks' sharp declines include losses that followed Trump’s bans on exports of the companies’ AI chips to China.\n\nHowever, Trump's planned change to the AI diffusion rule won't necessarily be a panacea for chip companies.\n\nNvidia logo.(Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) · SOPA Images via Getty Images\n\nReuters reported last week that Trump administration officials are weighing the creation of a global licensing regime for chip exports with government-to-government agreements to replace Biden's policy, which Citi analyst Atif Malik said in an analysis “would be potentially more strict than Biden's as they would put AI chips at the center of tariff negotiations.\""}

There is the need for Tesla to launch Supervised and unsupervised ridesharing in June in Austin.\n\nThe launch of supervised and unsupervised is not really a choice. Tesla plans to start day one with 10-20 unsupervised vehicles. The issue for ridesharing is to get proper coverage of a city with reasonable wait times there needs to be more cars. Tesla can start with a tiny area but after the first few days the novelty will wear off and they will need to have proper wait times and areas. Tesla needs to transition over the next 6-12 months to millions of cars, which will be the company owned fleet and customer owned cars. This transition is part of the plan.\n\nThere is the need to get the customer owned cars organized and prepared. The customers who want to participate will need to get access to car cleaning services or perform those tasks on their own.\n\nHaving the supervised ridesharing will get the owners ramped up and prepared.\n\nIt would make sense to launch city by city with supervised and unsupervised. Tesla already has been using about 300 cars in Austin and in the SF Bay Area to provide employee rides. The employee rides are supervised.\n\nThose employee supervised rides and 300 vehicles would be the core of a Tesla owned supervised service. They would just transition from employee-only rides to public rides.\n\nMore and more of the vehicles would transition from supervised to unsupervised. The supervised service would transition to customer owned cars who sign onto the app.\n\nThe first customers to sign up are Tesla owners who are already providing ridesharing services to Uber and Lyft.\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 and Model Y have become a popular choice among for-hire drivers. Uber incentivized their rideshare drivers to choose an EV, by offering discounts on rentals and the opportunity to earn extra money through green rides.\n\nWaymo partnering with Uber shows the need for robotaxi services that are too small to have a supervised ride option.\n\nHow Many Vehicles Need for 1 Million Austin Population?\n\nNumber of cars = (1) number of people that want to take a trip in a certain time period) / (2) people per car. (3) Then adjusting for some wait time factor.\n\nOf we assume 20% would want to use the Tesla rideshare service that would be 200,000 people.\n\n20,000 trips per day might be the actual daily usage. 20% might be monthly.\n\nIf we wanted a 30 minute wait time, we’d need 1,500 (trips per hour) x 3 = 4,500 cars available every 30 minutes.\n\nThe average Uber wait time in one city and study was roughly 15 minutes. The standard deviation was 7 minutes. This meant 65% of rides fell between an 8 and 22-minute window. And 2.5% of rides have a wait time of 30 minutes or more.\n\nHere is an older study of ridesharing in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe main point is that rolling out a ridesharing service with limited numbers of unsupervised vehicles will scale a lot better and with better customer satisfaction with a mix of supervised and unsupervised. Austin really needs 2000-4000 vehicles providing ridesharing to get acceptable wait times. The ecosystem will have to grow and even if the end state is millions of unsupervised cars, there is a smoother growth path using the mix of many supervised cars first and converting to unsupervised.\n\nRidesharing app\n\nThe Tesla ride service app and service is internally called Project Alicorn.\n\nThe ride service features include:\n\n•Confirm Pickup\n\n•Enter Destination\n\n•Fasten Seatbelt\n\n•Pull Over\n\n•Emergency Help\n\nSpotted: A camo’d Tesla prototype driving in LA?

Evidently, Tesla is preparing for the June launch of the Robotaxi by inputting some new features into the smartphone app, something that we reported on recently.\n\nTesla will not launch a Robotaxi app that operates separately from the standard app. Everything will be ingrained into the main Tesla app that you use to access your car."}

(The IRS is a subsidiary of the Treasury.) When asked by Congressman Steny Hoyer (D-MD) whether proposed reductions in the IRS's IT budget, along with plans to cut additional staff, would affect the agencies ability to collect tax revenue, Bessent said it wouldn't, thanks to the current \"AI boom.\"\n\n\"I believe through smarter IT, through this AI boom, that we can use that to enhance collections,\" Bessent told Hoyer and the Committee (24:29 into the video linked above). \"I expect collections would continue to be very robust as they were this year.\"\n\nBessent's comments didn't explain how the IRS intends to deploy AI. Given how much it has slashed its enforcement staff since Trump took office, the agency definitely needs to do something.\n\nThe Treasury Inspector General's office issued a report last week on IRS workforce reductions as of March indicating that more than 11,000 IRS employees (approximately 11 percent of the Service's workforce) had been terminated since Trump's Office of Personnel Management began directing government agencies to cut jobs.\n\nRevenue agents, whose job it is to audit tax returns for accuracy, made up the bulk of those fired. Those cuts affected 31 percent of the IRS's revenue agent workforce. Revenue officers, who are responsible for collecting delinquent taxes, were the second-most slashed position, with 18 percent of collections officials at the IRS fired during the layoffs.\n\nBessent made clear that replacing those terminated employees with new agents and officers wouldn't be worthwhile, as collections agents need time on the job to become effective.\n\n\"There is nothing that shows historically that bringing in unseasoned collections agents will result in more collections,\" Bessent told the Committee.\n\nThe IRS has been in touch to tell us that it already uses AI for some purposes, but it didn't share what new uses it might have for the tech with regards to Bessent's comments.\n\n\"IRS already uses AI for business functions including operational efficiency, compliance and fraud detection, and taxpayer services,\" the agency told us. \"AI use cases must follow all relevant IRS privacy and security policies.\"\n\nSo it's damn the workforce and full speed ahead on AI, then.\n\nWhat ever happened to 'AI won't take our jobs?'\n\nIt was just a couple of years ago that workers' AI fears were met with choruses from business and political leaders that learning machines wouldn't take jobs, just transform them, yet there is some evidence this is slowly changing.\n\nIn February, cloud software firm Workday slashed 8 percent of its workforce, around 1,750 jobs, in favor of AI, and just this week CrowdStrike announced plans to do the same. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told the Wall Street Journal Monday that his firm has done the same thing, replacing hundreds of HR staff with AI alternatives, with the added caveat that the move has allowed IBM to hire more developers, sales and marketing professionals.\n\nIn other words, AI is most definitely taking some jobs and leading tech companies aren't trying to hide it anymore.\n\nIronically enough, Krishna's proclamation that humans doing \"rote process work\" are easily replaced by AI came a day before his company released the results of a study of CEOs that found AI investments are mostly not paying off, at least not yet.\n\nThe study, published at IBM's Think conference this week, polled 2,000 business executives and found that only a quarter of their AI initiatives have resulted in expected returns. Instead of businesses investing in AI due to its benefits, IBM found that most businesses are doing it to avoid being left behind a curve that has yet to mean much. ®"}

How long will it take? How much will Congress agree to spend? How will the government avoid the mistakes of prior reform efforts?\n\nDuffy, who will be joined by the CEOs of the largest five U.S. airlines on Thursday to unveil the Trump administration plan, has said the project will take three or four years.\n\n“You are starting to see cracks in the system,” Duffy said last week. “Everything—the hardware and the software—has to be redone.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in a post on his social media platform before the announcement, blamed current air traffic control problems on the previous Biden administration and vowed “I WILL FIX IT.” He offered no details about the plan.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic control network’s manifold woes have been years in the making, but a rush of high-profile mishaps, near-misses and a catastrophic crash in January have spiked public alarm and prompted new calls for action.\n\nA mid-air collision between an American Airlines regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in January killed 67 people near Reagan Washington National Airport. On Thursday, another Army helicopter forced two flights to abort landings at Reagan.\n\nLast week, controllers overseeing traffic at Newark Liberty International Airport lost communications with airplanes for at least 30 seconds because of a telecommunications and radar failure. Since then, hundreds of flights have been canceled or diverted at the airport just outside New York City.\n\nA series of near misses between airplanes in recent months has further exposed the strain on air traffic control facilities and raised questions about pilot training amid repeated calls for reforms for years.\n\nFixing the system is a daunting task. Many of the 520 airports overseen by the FAA need new runway safety technology so controllers don’t rely on binoculars to see airplanes.\n\nIn 2022, for example, the FAA said it was working to end a long-ridiculed, decades-old practice of air traffic controllers using paper flight strips to keep track of aircraft. But adopting the change at 49 major airports will take the FAA until late 2029.\n\nFOUR DAYS OFF EACH MONTH\n\nThe FAA is currently about 3,500 air traffic controllers short of targeted staffing levels and nearly all control towers have staffing shortages. FAA controller staffing has been relatively flat in recent years—despite significant hiring—and is down 10% from 2012 because of retirements and trainees failing to complete requirements.\n\nNewark’s airport has become the poster child for air traffic control issues. After the 30-second communications lapse, several controllers took leave on the same day, compelling United Airlines to cut 35 daily Newark flights—or 10% of its schedule.\n\nAt many facilities, controllers are working mandatory overtime of up to 12 hours a day and six-day work weeks to cover shortages. That leaves just four days off each month for what air safety experts widely agree are high-stress jobs.\n\nThe FAA, which said in March it planned to hire 2,000air traffic controller trainees this year, will offer retirement-eligible controllers who are under the mandatory retirement age of 56 a lump sum payment of 20% of their basic pay for each year they continue to work.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office in September said the FAA must take “urgent action” to address aging air traffic control systems.\n\nGAO said 51 of the FAA’s 138 air traffic control systems are unsustainable. The FAA told the GAO last year not to plan to complete modernization projects for many systems for at least a decade.\n\nFormer Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen told Reuters “it’s been a journey of incrementalism with the FAA—some things we got right, some things left to fester over time.” One big question, he said, is who will oversee the project.\n\nTrump has said a large company like Raytheon or IBM could be in charge.\n\nIt takes years for the FAA to replace outdated systems.\n\nIn January 2023, the failure of a key pilot messaging system disrupted more than 11,000 flights in the first nationwide U.S. ground stop since 2001. The FAA said last month it now plans to deploy a new “Notice to Airmen” system by September after two recent failures of the current system.\n\nA November 2023 report from an independent FAA panel found the agency’s air traffic communications systems have been outdated for years and the agency can no longer get spare parts for many systems.\n\nIt cited aging FAA air traffic facilities with leaking roofs, broken elevators and heating and air conditioning systems and ancient surveillance radar systems that must soon be replaced at a cost of billions of dollars.\n\nIn 2017, then-President Donald Trump called for privatizing the air traffic control system by 2020—a plan that went nowhere.\n\n“We’re proposing to take American air travel into the future finally,” Trump said in 2017. “Our air traffic control system is stuck painfully in the past… We’re still stuck with an ancient, broken, antiquated horrible system that doesn’t work.”"}

By deploying AI bots capable of analysing data, conducting research and generating routine communications, the company reduced its reliance on traditional HR personnel—eliminating a few hundred roles. However, the savings and efficiencies gained were quickly redirected to recruit new talent in areas seen as essential to IBM’s future.\n\n“While we have done a huge amount of work inside IBM on leveraging AI and automation on certain enterprise workflows, our total employment has actually gone up,” Krishna said. “Because what it does is it gives you more investment to put into other areas.”\n\nThose areas include software engineering, sales and marketing—what Krishna described as “critical thinking” roles that require human interaction, creativity, and decision-making. These are domains, he added, that demand people “to do things that face up or against other humans, as opposed to just doing rote process work.”\n\nThis shift marks a significant change in how HR functions are being viewed and structured at large enterprises. Rather than being simply an administrative centre, HR is increasingly expected to evolve into a strategic enabler, leveraging technology while focusing on human-centric issues like talent development, workforce planning and employee experience.\n\nIBM has not disclosed the exact timeline over which these HR job reductions occurred, but the transformation highlights a broader trend: organisations are turning to automation to streamline operational tasks in HR, while redeploying resources to functions that directly impact innovation and growth.\n\nThe company’s internal AI agents now handle a range of HR-related tasks—from screening CVs and sending follow-up communications to analysing workforce data. This, according to Krishna, has freed up the company to pursue a more agile and responsive recruitment strategy, particularly in technical and client-facing roles.\n\nThe implications of IBM’s model extend beyond its own workforce. For the HR profession as a whole, the shift signals a new phase in which automation is not just a threat, but a catalyst for transformation. Routine HR tasks such as payroll, compliance reporting, and performance tracking are increasingly being automated, allowing HR professionals to focus on strategic responsibilities like talent engagement, leadership development and organisational culture.\n\nHowever, such transitions are not without risk. As firms lean more heavily on AI and automation, questions remain around the ethics of displacement, the transparency of AI decision-making, and how to reskill HR professionals for a more strategic role. IBM’s approach appears to bet on the idea that while automation may reduce headcount in some support roles, it can create opportunities elsewhere—if managed thoughtfully.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Krishna has spoken about AI’s ability to reduce operational costs while opening up new growth areas. Earlier this year, he said that as the cost of AI continues to drop, its use will likely “explode,” driving demand for the technology across sectors. “We will find that the usage will explode as costs come down,” he told Bloomberg Television in February.\n\nDespite these internal gains, Krishna remains cautious about external pressures, such as trade policy. Speaking about the impact of former President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Krishna said the effect on IBM had so far been limited because most of its high-end systems, including mainframes and quantum computers, are built domestically. Still, he warned that if tariffs lead to reduced discretionary spending, particularly in the consulting space, IBM could be forced to make tougher decisions.\n\n“If the impact is within 3 to 4%, you actually can grit and manage through it,” Krishna said. “If the impact is going to be more like 10%, then that requires a lot more hardheaded management decisions.”\n\nKrishna’s comments come amid wider debates about how AI will reshape workforces globally. His perspective—that automation in HR can be a springboard rather than a setback—offers a noteworthy case study for organisations contemplating similar shifts. As more firms integrate AI into their talent functions, the IBM example may serve as both a blueprint and a warning: automate wisely, reinvest strategically, and ensure people remain at the heart of workforce transformation.\n\n\n\nTOPICS:\n\nBusiness/Economy\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\nhire\n\nhr\n\nibm\n\nIn my experience as both a job seeker and as a hiring manager, HR recruiters are weak at best or an active hindrance mostly as they filter out the good can and give you candidates who have buzzwords but no experience\n\n\n\nTo: Cronos\n\nBut you think AI is better?\n\n\n\nTo: Cronos\n\n\n\n\n\nby 3 posted onby Magnum44 (...against all enemies, foreign and domestic... )\n\nTo: Cronos\n\nI work at a small startup Tech company, about 50 people.

While Istio’s default ingress gateway does a decent job, I found that relying on a single gateway can introduce scaling and isolation challenges.\n\nThat’s where configuring multiple Istio Ingress Gateways can make a real difference. In this article, I’ll walk you through how I approached this setup, what benefits it unlocked for our team, and the hands-on steps we used, along with best practices and YAML configurations that you can adapt in your own clusters.\n\nWhy Do We Use an Additional Ingress Gateway?\n\nUsing an additional Istio Ingress Gateway provides several advantages:\n\nTraffic isolation: Route traffic based on workload-specific needs (e.g., API traffic vs. UI traffic or transactional vs. non-transactional applications). Multi-tenancy: Different teams can have their gateway while still using a shared service mesh. Scalability: Distribute traffic across multiple gateways to handle higher loads efficiently. Security and compliance: Apply different security policies to specific gateway instances. Flexibility: You can create any number of additional ingress gateways based on project or application needs. Best practices: Kubernetes teams often use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Pod Disruption Budget (PDB), Services, Gateways, and Region-Based Filtering (via Envoy Filters) to enhance reliability and performance.\n\nUnderstanding Istio Architecture\n\nIstio IngressGateway and Sidecar Proxy: Ensuring Secure Traffic Flow\n\nWhen I first began working with Istio, one of the key concepts that stood out was the use of sidecar proxies. Every pod in the mesh requires an Envoy sidecar to manage traffic securely. This ensures that no pod can bypass security or observability policies.\n\nWithout a sidecar proxy, applications cannot communicate internally or with external sources.\n\nThe Istio Ingress Gateway manages external traffic entry but relies on sidecar proxies to enforce security and routing policies.\n\nThis enables zero-trust networking, observability, and resilience across microservices.\n\nHow Traffic Flows in Istio With Single and Multiple Ingress Gateways\n\nIn an Istio service mesh, all external traffic follows a structured flow before reaching backend services. The Cloud Load Balancer acts as the entry point, forwarding requests to the Istio Gateway Resource, which determines traffic routing based on predefined policies.\n\nHere's how we structured the traffic flow in our setup:\n\nCloud Load Balancer receives external requests and forwards them to Istio's Gateway Resource. The Gateway Resource evaluates routing rules and directs traffic to the appropriate ingress gateway: Pr imary ingress gateway : Handles UI requests.\n\n: Handles UI requests. Additional ingress gateways: Route API, transactional, and non-transactional traffic separately. Envoy Sidecar Proxies enforce security policies, manage traffic routing, and monitor observability metrics. Requests are forwarded to the respective Virtual Services, which process and direct them to the final backend service.\n\nThis structure ensures better traffic segmentation, security, and performance scalability, especially in multi-cloud Kubernetes deployments.\n\nFigure 1: Istio Service Mesh Architecture – Traffic routing from Cloud Load Balancer to Istio Gateway Resource, Ingress Gateways, and Service Mesh.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Components of Istio Architecture\n\nIngress gateway : Handles external traffic and routes requests based on policies.\n\nSidecar proxy : Ensures all service-to-service communication follows Istio-managed rules.\n\n: Ensures all service-to-service communication follows Istio-managed rules. Control plane: Manages traffic control, security policies, and service discovery.\n\nOrganizations can configure multiple Istio Ingress Gateways by leveraging these components to enhance traffic segmentation, security, and performance across multi-cloud environments.\n\nComparison: Single vs. Multiple Ingress Gateways\n\nWe started with a single ingress gateway and quickly realized that as traffic grew, it became a bottleneck. Splitting traffic using multiple ingress gateways was a simple but powerful change that drastically improved routing efficiency and fault isolation.\n\nOn the other hand, multiple ingress gateways allowed better traffic segmentation for APIs, UI, and transaction-based workloads, improved security enforcement by isolating sensitive traffic, and scalability and high availability, ensuring each type of request is handled optimally.\n\nThe following diagram compares a single Istio Ingress Gateway with multiple ingress gateways for handling API and web traffic.\n\nFigure 2: Single vs. Multiple Istio Ingress Gateways – Comparing routing, traffic segmentation, and scalability differences.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways from the comparison:\n\nA single Istio Ingress Gateway routes all traffic through a single entry point, which may become a bottleneck.\n\nMultiple ingress gateways allow better traffic segmentation, handling API traffic and UI traffic separately.\n\nSecurity policies and scaling strategies can be defined per gateway, making it ideal for multi-cloud or multi-region deployments.\n\nFeature Single Ingress Gateway Multiple Ingress Gateways Traffic Isolation No isolation, all traffic routes through a single gateway Different gateways for UI, API, transactional traffic Resilience If the single gateway fails, traffic is disrupted Additional ingress gateways ensure redundancy Scalability Traffic bottlenecks may occur Load distributed across multiple gateways Security Same security rules apply to all traffic shared Custom security policies per gateway\n\n\n\nSetting Up an Additional Ingress Gateway\n\nHow Additional Ingress Gateways Improve Traffic Routing\n\nWe tested routing different workloads (UI, API, transactional) through separate gateways. This gave each gateway its own scaling behavior and security profile. It also helped isolate production incidents — for example, UI errors no longer impacted transactional requests.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates how multiple Istio Ingress Gateways efficiently manage API, UI, and transactional traffic.\n\nFigure 3: Multi-Gateway Traffic Flow – External traffic segmentation across API, UI, and transactional ingress gateways.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nCloud Load Balancer forwards traffic to the Istio Gateway Resource, which determines routing rules.\n\nTraffic is directed to different ingress gateways: The Primary ingress gateway handles UI traffic. The API Ingress Gateway handles API requests. The Transactional Ingress Gateway ensures financial transactions and payments are processed securely.\n\nThe Service Mesh enforces security, traffic policies, and observability.\n\nStep 1: Install Istio and Configure Operator\n\nFor our setup, we used Istio’s Operator pattern to manage lifecycle operations. It’s flexible and integrates well with GitOps workflows.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nKubernetes cluster with Istio installed\n\nHelm installed for deploying Istio components\n\nEnsure you have Istio installed. If not, install it using the following commands:\n\nPlain Text curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=$(istio_version) TARGET_ARCH=x86_64 sh - export PATH=\"$HOME/istio-$ISTIO_VERSION/bin:$PATH\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInitialize the Istio Operator\n\nPlain Text istioctl operator init\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the Installation\n\nPlain Text kubectl get crd | grep istio\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Installation Using Helm\n\nIstio Ingress Gateway configurations can be managed using Helm charts for better flexibility and reusability. This allows teams to define customizable values.yaml files and deploy gateways dynamically.\n\nHelm upgrade command:\n\nPlain Text helm upgrade --install istio-ingress istio/gateway -f values.yaml\n\n\n\n\n\nThis allows dynamic configuration management, making it easier to manage multiple ingress gateways.\n\nStep 2: Configure Additional Ingress Gateways With IstioOperator\n\nWe defined separate gateways in the IstioOperator config (additional-ingress-gateway.yaml) — one for UI and one for API — and kept them logically grouped using Helm values files. This made our Helm pipelines cleaner and easier to scale or modify.\n\nBelow is an example configuration to create multiple additional ingress gateways for different traffic types:\n\nYAML apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1 kind: IstioOperator metadata: name: additional-ingressgateways namespace: istio-system spec: components: ingressGateways: - name: istio-ingressgateway-ui enabled: true k8s: service: type: LoadBalancer - name: istio-ingressgateway-api enabled: true k8s: service: type: LoadBalancer\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Additional Configuration Examples for Helm\n\nWe found that adding HPA and PDB configs early helped ensure we didn’t hit availability issues during upgrades. This saved us during one incident where the default config couldn’t handle a traffic spike in the API gateway.\n\nBelow are sample configurations for key Kubernetes objects that enhance the ingress gateway setup:\n\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)\n\nYAML apiVersion: autoscaling/v2 kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: ingressgateway-hpa namespace: istio-system spec: minReplicas: 2 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: Resource resource: name: cpu target: type: Utilization averageUtilization: 80 scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: istio-ingressgateway\n\n\n\n\n\nPod Disruption Budget (PDB)\n\nYAML apiVersion: policy/v1 kind: PodDisruptionBudget metadata: name: ingressgateway-pdb namespace: istio-system spec: minAvailable: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: istio-ingressgateway\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion-Based Envoy Filter\n\nYAML apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: EnvoyFilter metadata: name: region-header-filter namespace: istio-system spec: configPatches: - applyTo: HTTP_FILTER match: context: GATEWAY listener: filterChain: filter: name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager subFilter: name: envoy.filters.http.router proxy: proxyVersion: ^1\\.18.* patch: operation: INSERT_BEFORE value: name: envoy.filters.http.lua typed_config: '@type': type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.lua.v3.Lua inlineCode: | function envoy_on_response(response_handle) response_handle:headers():add(\"X-Region\", \"us-eus\"); end\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Deploy Additional Ingress Gateways\n\nApply the configuration using istioctl:\n\nPlain Text istioctl install -f additional-ingress-gateway.yaml\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the new ingress gateways are running:\n\nPlain Text kubectl get pods -n istio-system | grep ingressgateway\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the configuration, we monitored the rollout using kubectl get pods and validated each gateway's service endpoint. Naming conventions like istio-ingressgateway-ui really helped keep things organized.\n\nStep 5: Define Gateway Resources for Each Ingress\n\nEach ingress gateway should have a corresponding gateway resource. Below is an example of defining separate gateways for UI, API, transactional, and non-transactional traffic:\n\nYAML apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: Gateway metadata: name: my-ui-gateway namespace: default spec: selector: istio: istio-ingressgateway-ui servers: - port: number: 443 name: https protocol: HTTPS hosts: - \"ui.example.com\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat similar configurations for API, transactional, and non-transactional ingress gateways.\n\nMake sure your gateway resources use the correct selector. We missed this during our first attempt, and traffic didn’t route properly — a simple detail, big impact.\n\nStep 6: Route Traffic Using Virtual Services\n\nOnce the gateways are configured, create Virtual Services to control traffic flow to respective services.\n\nYAML apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: VirtualService metadata: name: my-api-service namespace: default spec: hosts: - \"api.example.com\" gateways: - my-api-gateway http: - route: - destination: host: my-api port: number: 80\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat similar configurations for UI, transactional, and non-transactional services.\n\nJust a note that VirtualServices gives you fine-grained control over traffic. We even used them to test traffic mirroring and canary rollouts between the gateways.\n\nResilience and High Availability With Additional Ingress Gateways\n\nOne of the biggest benefits we noticed: zero downtime during regional failovers. Having dedicated gateways meant we could perform rolling updates with zero user impact.\n\nThis model also helped us comply with region-specific policies by isolating sensitive data flows per gateway — a crucial point when dealing with financial workloads.\n\nIf the primary ingress gateway fails, additional ingress gateways can take over traffic seamlessly.\n\nWhen performing rolling upgrades or Kubernetes version upgrades, separating ingress traffic reduces downtime risk.\n\nIn multi-region or multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters, additional ingress gateways allow better control of regional traffic and compliance with local regulations.\n\nDeploying additional IngressGateways enhances resilience and fault tolerance in a Kubernetes environment.\n\nBest Practices and Lessons Learned\n\nMany teams forget that Istio sidecars must be injected into every application pod to ensure service-to-service communication. Below are some lessons we learned the hard way\n\nWhen deploying additional ingress gateways, consider implementing:\n\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) : Automatically scale ingress gateways based on CPU and memory usage.\n\n: Automatically scale ingress gateways based on CPU and memory usage. Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB) : Ensure high availability during node upgrades or failures.\n\n: Ensure high availability during node upgrades or failures. Region-Based Filtering (EnvoyFilter) : Optimize traffic routing by dynamically setting request headers with the appropriate region.\n\n: Optimize traffic routing by dynamically setting request with the appropriate region. Dedicated services and gateways : Separate logical entities for better security and traffic isolation.\n\n: Separate logical entities for better security and traffic isolation. Ensure automatic sidecar injection is enabled in your namespace: Plain Text kubectl label namespace <your-namespace> istio-injection=enabled\n\nValidate that all pods have sidecars using: Plain Text kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace> -o wide kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace> -o jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.containers[*].name}' | grep istio-proxy\n\nWithout sidecars, services will not be able to communicate, leading to failed requests and broken traffic flow.\n\nWhen upgrading additional ingress gateways, consider the following:\n\nDelete old Istio configurations (if needed): If you are upgrading or modifying Istio, delete outdated configurations: Plain Text kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io istio-sidecar-injector kubectl get crd --all-namespaces | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete crd\n\nEnsure updates to proxy version, deployment image, and service labels during upgrades to avoid compatibility issues. YAML proxyVersion: ^1.18.* image: docker.io/istio/proxyv2:1.18.6\n\nScaling down Istio Operator: Before upgrading, scale down the Istio Operator to avoid disruptions. Plain Text kubectl scale deployment -n istio-operator istio-operator --replicas=0\n\nBackup before upgrade: Plain Text kubectl get deploy,svc,cm,secret -n istio-system -o yaml > istio-backup.yaml\n\nMonitoring and Observability With Grafana\n\nWith Istio's built-in monitoring, Grafana dashboards provide a way to segregate traffic flow by ingress type:\n\nMonitor API, UI, transactional, and non-transactional traffic separately.\n\nQuickly identify which traffic type is affected when an issue occurs in Production using Prometheus-based metrics\n\nIstio Gateway metrics can be monitored in Grafana & Prometheus to track traffic patterns, latency, and errors.\n\nIt provides real-time metrics for troubleshooting and performance optimization.\n\nUsing PrometheusAlertmanager, configure alerts for high error rates, latency spikes, and failed request patterns to improve reliability.\n\nFYI, we extended our dashboards in Grafana to visualize traffic per gateway. This was a game-changer — we could instantly see which gateway was spiking and correlate it to service metrics. Prometheus alerting was configured to trigger based on error rates per ingress type. This helped us catch and resolve issues before they impacted end users.\n\nConclusion\n\nImplementing multiple Istio Ingress Gateways significantly transformed the architecture of our Kubernetes environments. This approach enabled us to independently scale different types of traffic, enforce custom security policies per gateway, and gain enhanced control over traffic management, scalability, security, and observability.\n\nBy segmenting traffic into dedicated ingress gateways — for UI, API, transactional, and non-transactional services — we achieved stronger isolation, improved load balancing, and more granular policy enforcement across teams.\n\nThis approach is particularly critical in multi-cloud Kubernetes environments, such as Azure AKS, Google GKE, Amazon EKS, Red Hat OpenShift, VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, Oracle OKE, and self-managed Kubernetes clusters, where regional traffic routing, failover handling, and security compliance must be carefully managed.\n\nBy leveraging best practices, including:\n\nSidecar proxies for service-to-service security\n\nHPA ( HorizontalPodAutoscaler ) for autoscaling\n\n) for autoscaling PDB ( PodDisruptionBudget ) for availability\n\n) for availability Envoy filters for intelligent traffic routing\n\nfor intelligent traffic routing Helm-based deployments for dynamic configuration\n\nOrganizations can build a highly resilient and efficient Kubernetes networking stack.\n\nAdditionally, monitoring dashboards like Grafana and Prometheus provide deep observability into ingress traffic patterns, latency trends, and failure points, allowing real-time tracking of traffic flow, quick root-cause analysis, and proactive issue resolution.\n\nBy following these principles, organizations can optimize their Istio-based service mesh architecture, ensuring high availability, enhanced security posture, and seamless performance across distributed cloud environments.\n\nReferences"}

The Paris-based AI firm introduced the enterprise-focused model with an emphasis on high performance at lower costs. It is claimed to be state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of performance in its class, and is said to be available at significantly lower costs compared to the competition. Notably, Mistral Medium 3 is not an open-source model and will not be available on open repositories such as GitHub and Hugging Face.\n\nMistral Medium 3 Details and Pricing\n\nIn a newsroom post, the AI firm shared details about the capabilities of the new AI model. Notably, in March, Mistral released Small 3.1 open-source model with a context window of up to 1,28,000 tokens. The Medium 3 is part of the company's enterprise-focused offerings. These are paid models that can be accessed via cloud services and as an application programming interface (API).\n\nMistral Medium 3 is a multimodal large language model (LLM) which can be deployed in a hybrid setup (cloud + edge) or on-premise and in virtual private cloud (VPC) setups. The model can be post-trained by enterprises on their internal data to make its responses grounded. Additionally, the model can be integrated into enterprise tools and systems.\n\nComing to pricing, the Mistral Medium 3 AI model will cost $0.4 (roughly Rs. 34) per million input tokens and $2 (roughly Rs. 171) per million output tokens. For reference, the Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a model Mistral says Medium 3 is comparable to, is priced at $3 (roughly Rs. 257) per million input and $15 (roughly Rs. 1,284) per million output tokens.\n\nBased on internal testing conducted by the French AI firm, the Mistral Medium 3 AI model outperforms Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on several benchmarks such as HumanEval, ArenaHard, Math500 Instruct, and AI2D. The scores are also comparable to the DeepSeek 3.1 model in several benchmarks.\n\nEnterprises and developers interested in using Mistral Medium 3 can access it as an API on Mistral La Plateforme and Amazon Sagemaker. The company will also make it available on IBM WatsonX, Nvidia NIM, Azure AI Foundry, and Google's Vertex AI soon.\n\nNotably, Mistral also teased that after the launches of Small and Medium AI models, it is now working on an open-source Large AI model, which could arrive later this year."}

Tariffs are a tax on goods imported into the U.S. The highest tariff rates are being imposed on China, with rates reaching 145% for some items.\n\nThe stated goals of the Trump Administration's tariff policy are to combat other nations' allegedly unfair trade policies and to increase domestic manufacturing. The tariff policy has created strong incentives for manufacturers to expand U.S.-based operations, leading to a wave of new domestic investments.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed the Trump Administration secured nearly $5 trillion in U.S. investments from major companies. While the investments are spread across multiple industries, the tech industry is particularly well represented, with several major vendors announcing large investments in U.S. manufacturing.\n\nApple Apple is among the big tech vendors that have pledged to increase U.S. manufacturing. Apple is particularly at risk from the Trump Administration tariffs as it manufactures nearly all its products outside of the U.S., including the company's popular iPhone, iPad and Mac hardware products. On Feb. 24, 2025, Apple announced it was committing to invest $500 billion in the U.S. The investment is intended to be extended over a five-year period. That investment includes plans to build an AI server manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas, that could open as soon as 2026. The Texas facility is a 250,000-square-foot operation that will build AI servers used as part of Apple Intelligence and the Private Cloud Compute service. The company also revealed it plans to hire 20,000 new employees in the U.S. as part of its renewed commitment to domestic production in the U.S. Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that Apple will work with companies and people across the country to expand American manufacturing and innovation. This is Apple's largest-ever spend commitment.\n\nIBM IBM, which has operated in the U.S. for over 100 years, is also reacting to the Trump Administration's policies with renewed domestic investment. On April 28, 2025, IBM announced it planned to invest $150 billion in the U.S. over five years. IBM plans to use $30 billion of the investment funds being allocated to manufacturing operations in the U.S. specifically for mainframe computers and quantum computing. Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman, president and CEO, stated that IBM has always been focused on American jobs.\n\nNvidia Nvidia is among the many tech vendors at risk from the Trump Administration tariffs, as the company produces nearly all its hardware outside of the U.S. On April 14, 2025, Nvidia announced it would start building AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. for the first time. Nvidia estimates the overall value of its U.S. manufacturing investments will generate approximately $500 billion worth of AI infrastructure. The effort will include the manufacture of multiple components and a series of vendor partnerships. The company's flagship Blackwell AI chip will be fabricated at a new Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) chip plant in Phoenix, Ariz. New supercomputer manufacturing plants are also being built in Texas, with Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas. Amkor and SPIL will handle packaging and testing operations. Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, stated that AI chips will be built in the U.S. for the first time.\n\nTSMC TSMC, which has largely produced chips in its home country of Taiwan, is also among the big technology companies making large investments in the U.S. While the Trump Administration tariffs are a key driver, the TSMC investment is also partially supported by the CHIPS Act, which is a Biden Administration-era action designed to increase domestic production of semiconductor technologies. TSMC announced on March 4, 2025, that it was investing $165 billion in domestic manufacturing inside the U.S. The total investment includes the $65 billion the company previously announced for a semiconductor fab in Phoenix. With the new investment, TSMC plans to expand its Arizona semiconductor operations to support the needs of multiple vendors, including Nvidia, Apple and AMD. The plan is to produce an array of chips, including 4nm chips initially and 3nm and 2nm chips by the end of 2028."}

They’re very big, very powerful monetarily, and they give you a guarantee, and they hook up everything. They do every single thing.”\n\nDuffy has so far not released details about the plan. A Department of Transportation advisory touted Thursday’s event as “ushering in a golden age of transportation.”\n\n– Newark in focus –\n\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced it has been slowing arrivals and departures at Newark after the system outage.\n\nOther steps included adding more backup equipment and bolstering air traffic controller staffing, the FAA said.\n\nWhile Newark’s staffing issues are the norm across the network, the incident highlights unique problems at the airport, said Michael McCormick, a former FAA control tower manager who is now associate professor at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University.\n\nMcCormick said the telecommunications failures stem from the FAA’s 2024 relocation of Newark air traffic staff from Long Island to Philadelphia.\n\nEven with the loss of contact with air traffic staff, pilots would have still been able to safely fly during the outage because of on-board technology that tracks other planes, McCormick said.\n\n“There’s still backup,” McCormick said. “It’s not optimal.”"}

It beat analyst expectations of $0.55 per share with $0.72 earnings per share.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, TKO earned revenue of $1.2688B and turned that into a net profit of $165.5M. Its adjusted EBITDA was $417M. Estimated revenue was adjusted for the year from $2.93-$3B to $3.005B-$3.075B.\n\nIn addition, the company paid out its first-ever dividend on March 31st.\n\nUFC had revenue of $360M as live events and corporate sponsorships continue to rise. Notably, the UFC renewed its deal with one of its longtime sponsors, Monster Energy. It also secured Meta as a sponsor. This shows an increase of $47M from last year. WWE had revenue of $391.5M in Q1 as compared to $317M last year.\n\nThe UFC showed improvements in most of its sectors: Media rights, Live events and Partnerships. The only segment where it lags from last year was Consumer Products which showed revenue of $12.7M as opposed to $14.6M last year.\n\nWWE showed increases in all of its segments including Consumer Products.\n\nNotably, in Q1, TKO made its second installment of the $375M settlement in the Le UFC antitrust lawsuit. In February 2025, it paid out $125M out of escrow in February 2025. It will make its last payment in the second quarter of 2025. The first installment occurred in October 2024.\n\nAlso of note, the Sports Business Journal mentioned the issue of tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration affecting public companies. Looks like it helps to be friends with the president.\n\nAs the UFC media rights negotiations will start to heat up, it is worth noting how much Netflix has embraced WWE Raw. Moreover, there is speculation that TKO will land the Canelo Alvarez-Terence Crawford fight will land on Netflix which could help with the streaming service landing the UFC.\n\nPayout Perspective:\n\nThe earnings highlight the continued growth of the UFC and WWE. Both companies are riding highs with its popularity which is reflected in the live gates and corporate sponsorships. Since taking over, TKO has been much more aggressive with sponsorships for WWE as exemplified with signage on the mat. The UFC has secured some big sponsorships including renewing with Monster Energy, Meta and IBM."}

Their ability to understand and generate human-like text has given rise to a wave of applications, from sophisticated chatbots to powerful content creation tools. As these models become more capable, we’re seeing the emergence of AI systems often referred to as “agents.” However, within this developing landscape, it’s crucial to differentiate between what might be termed “plain LLM agents” and the more complex and increasingly impactful concept of “Agentic AI.” While the terminology is still evolving rapidly, understanding this distinction is key to appreciating the capabilities and potential of the next generation of AI systems.\n\nThe Nature of Plain LLM Agents\n\nThink of a plain LLM agent as a highly sophisticated language processor, equipped with an incredible ability to understand context and generate relevant text based on the input it receives. These systems excel at tasks that are primarily communicative or informational. You provide a prompt, and they generate a coherent and often insightful response. This is the experience many of us have with contemporary AI chatbots or language-based assistants. Their power lies in their linguistic fluency and the vast knowledge embedded within their training data.\n\nA plain LLM agent operates largely in a reactive mode. It waits for a query or prompt and then processes it using its language capabilities. It can access and utilize information and even employ simple tools (like searching the web or a calculator) if integrated, but its actions are typically a direct, single-step response to the immediate input. There’s a limited sense of continuity beyond the current interaction, and the system doesn’t typically formulate long-term strategies or independently decide on a course of action without explicit prompting for each step. Their memory is often confined to the immediate conversational window or the length of the current interaction.\n\nAn Example: Data Discovery with Plain LLMs\n\nConsider a practical example relevant to many enterprises: the challenge of data discovery and analysis for professionals like database engineers, business analysts, and data scientists. Historically, finding the specific data required to answer a business question is a time-consuming process. It involves navigating complex data stores, deciphering dense data dictionaries and metadata, and engaging in numerous manual steps and consultations with subject matter experts to understand the relevance and structure of different datasets. This intricate process, filled with trials and errors, can often take days, or even weeks, before the right data is identified and utilized to generate actionable insights.\n\nA plain LLM-based solution can offer significant acceleration in this initial data discovery phase. By providing the LLM with access to an organization’s data dictionaries, schema information, and other relevant metadata, a user can pose questions in natural language like, “Show me the tables that contain customer transaction details for the last fiscal year” or “Where can I find information about product inventory levels?” The LLM, acting as an intelligent interface, processes this natural language query, leverages its understanding of language and the provided technical documentation, and generates a response suggesting relevant datasets, tables, or even column names. This is a powerful application of a plain LLM agent — it effectively translates a human request into relevant technical information based on its training and the provided context, drastically reducing the initial manual exploration time. This type of solution, focused on understanding the user’s intent and retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base, is a prime example of how LLMs can serve as highly effective, although primarily reactive, tools for specific tasks.\n\nBeyond Basic Reactivity\n\nMoving along the spectrum, some more advanced LLM-based systems for data interaction incorporate multiple steps or specialized modules (we call them agents) orchestrated in a sequence to improve performance and accuracy. For instance, such an agent might first use an LLM to classify the user’s intent within a specific business domain (e.g., sales, operations, finance). Based on this classification, another agent might identify a narrowed set of potentially relevant data sources. Subsequent agents could involve using the LLM to generate potential queries, which might then be validated or refined. While these agents employ a more structured workflow and leverage the LLM for different sub-tasks, they often still operate primarily in response to an initial user prompt and follow a predefined sequence of operations. They represent a significant enhancement over a basic prompt-response LLM but may still lack the deeper autonomy and adaptive planning characteristic of true Agentic AI.\n\nUnderstanding Agentic AI\n\nAgentic AI, however, envisions a system with a substantially higher degree of autonomy and proactive capability. It moves beyond simply processing language or executing a predefined multi-step process in response to a query. A truly agentic AI system is designed to understand a broader, high-level goal and independently strategize, plan multi-step actions, utilize a diverse set of tools, and adapt its approach based on the outcomes and dynamic changes in its environment, all aimed at achieving that overarching objective with minimal human intervention.\n\nAgentic AI in Action: Transforming Data Discovery\n\nApplying the principles of Agentic AI to the data discovery and analysis challenge would transform the system from a sophisticated tool that answers direct questions or follows a fixed workflow into a proactive, intelligent collaborator that helps solve the entire data-related business problem from initiation to insight.\n\nAn agentic data analysis system would start with a complex, potentially ambiguous business objective, such as “Understand the key factors contributing to customer retention issues in the past year and propose data-backed strategies to improve it.” Instead of requiring the user to specify datasets or formulate queries, the Agentic AI, understanding this high-level goal, would autonomously work on a multi-step process:\n\nGoal Decomposition and Planning: The agent would break down the broad objective into a series of necessary, interconnected sub-goals: identify relevant customer data, explore historical interaction and transaction data, find demographic and behavioral information, analyze trends in customer activity before churn, and identify potential correlations. It would then formulate a dynamic plan, outlining the steps needed to achieve these sub-goals.\n\nThe agent would break down the broad objective into a series of necessary, interconnected sub-goals: identify relevant customer data, explore historical interaction and transaction data, find demographic and behavioral information, analyze trends in customer activity before churn, and identify potential correlations. It would then formulate a dynamic plan, outlining the steps needed to achieve these sub-goals. Autonomous Tool Utilization and Orchestration: A crucial capability here is the agent’s ability to seamlessly interact with and orchestrate a variety of external tools and systems. This could include: Interfacing with data catalogs and governance tools to identify potential datasets and understand their compliance and access restrictions. Employing database query tools (like SQL or NoSQL clients) not just to execute generated queries, but to explore schemas, sample data, and understand table relationships through iterative interaction. Using data profiling tools to assess data quality and identify potential issues that might impact analysis. Leveraging statistical or machine learning libraries to perform exploratory data analysis or build preliminary models to test hypotheses. Interacting with visualization tools to present findings or explore data distributions. Potentially utilizing internal communication systems to proactively ask clarifying questions to subject matter experts based on ambiguities encountered in the data or documentation.\n\nA crucial capability here is the agent’s ability to seamlessly interact with and orchestrate a variety of external tools and systems. This could include: Reasoning, Self-Correction, and Adaptation: As the agent executes its plan, it would continuously reason about the results of its actions. If a query returns unexpected data, if a data profiling reveals significant quality issues, or if an initial analysis doesn’t yield meaningful insights, the agent would be capable of recognizing these discrepancies, diagnosing potential causes, and adapting its plan autonomously. This might involve revisiting earlier steps, exploring alternative datasets, or trying different analytical approaches without requiring explicit human guidance for each adjustment.\n\nAs the agent executes its plan, it would continuously reason about the results of its actions. If a query returns unexpected data, if a data profiling reveals significant quality issues, or if an initial analysis doesn’t yield meaningful insights, the agent would be capable of recognizing these discrepancies, diagnosing potential causes, and adapting its plan autonomously. This might involve revisiting earlier steps, exploring alternative datasets, or trying different analytical approaches without requiring explicit human guidance for each adjustment. Persistent Memory and Context: The agent would maintain a rich, persistent memory of its exploration process — the datasets examined, the queries executed, the patterns observed, the hypotheses tested, and the conclusions drawn at each stage. This comprehensive context allows it to build upon previous findings and avoid redundant efforts, enabling a more efficient and focused investigation over an extended period.\n\nThe agent would maintain a rich, persistent memory of its exploration process — the datasets examined, the queries executed, the patterns observed, the hypotheses tested, and the conclusions drawn at each stage. This comprehensive context allows it to build upon previous findings and avoid redundant efforts, enabling a more efficient and focused investigation over an extended period. Proactive Insights and Actions: Beyond simply delivering data or analysis results when the task is complete, an agentic system could proactively identify interesting patterns, flag potential issues, or suggest follow-up questions or analyses based on its ongoing exploration and the initial high-level goal. It moves from being a tool that responds to commands to a partner that actively contributes to problem-solving.\n\nThis level of autonomous planning, dynamic tool orchestration, continuous reasoning, and adaptive execution, driven by a high-level goal, is what truly distinguishes Agentic AI. It’s a fundamental shift from AI systems that primarily talk or generate content or even execute fixed workflows, to AI systems that do, act, and strategize independently in pursuit of complex objectives.\n\nRecognizing this distinction is vital as we continue to build and deploy increasingly capable AI systems. The evolution from simple LLM-powered assistants to systems with growing agentic capabilities marks a significant step towards more versatile and impactful artificial intelligence, capable of tackling more complex, real-world problems with greater autonomy.\n\nPath Towards Artificial General Intelligence\n\nThe development of Agentic AI is not just about creating more capable specialized systems; it is also seen as a crucial step along the path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While there is no single, universally agreed-upon definition of AGI, it is generally understood as an AI system that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks at a human-like level, rather than being limited to a specific domain (like playing chess or generating text). AGI would exhibit characteristics like common sense, creativity, and the ability to reason and make decisions in novel situations.\n\nWhy are agentic capabilities considered important for AGI? The core components of Agentic AI—the ability to understand goals, plan, execute actions in an environment, utilize tools, manage memory, and adapt—are fundamentally aligned with the abilities we associate with general intelligence. An AGI system would need to interact with the world, set its own sub-goals to achieve larger objectives, learn from its experiences in a persistent way, and leverage whatever resources are available (tools) to accomplish tasks across diverse domains.\n\nCurrent LLMs, while demonstrating impressive language understanding and generation, are often described as lacking “agency” in the human sense. They don’t inherently want to achieve a goal or independently decide to take a series of actions in the real or digital world without explicit prompting or external frameworks guiding their behavior. Agentic AI research focuses precisely on building these missing pieces: the architectures and capabilities that enable AI systems to act more autonomously and purposefully in dynamic environments.\n\nTherefore, advancements in Agentic AI are pushing the boundaries of what AI can do, moving it closer to the kind of flexible, goal-directed behavior expected of AGI. While achieving true AGI remains a significant scientific and engineering challenge, the progress being made in developing agentic systems is seen as contributing foundational elements—building blocks like sophisticated planning algorithms, robust memory systems, and seamless tool integration—that are essential for creating AI that can operate with the breadth and adaptability characteristic of general intelligence. The journey toward AGI is likely a long one, but the development of increasingly capable agentic AI systems is a clear indicator of progress, demonstrating the path towards AI that can not only understand the world but also act within it effectively and autonomously.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
