The 2024 Public Access Policy, originally slated to go into effect on December 31, 2025, will now be effective as of July 1, 2025.\n\nTo be clear, maximum transparency regarding the research we support is our default position. Since the release of NIH’s 2008 Public Access Policy, more than 1.5 million articles reporting on NIH-supported research have been made freely available to the public through PubMed Central. While the 2008 Policy allowed for an up to 12-month delay before such articles were required to be made publicly available, in 2024, NIH revised the Public Access Policy to remove the embargo period so that researchers, students, and members of the public have rapid access to these findings.\n\nNIH is the crown jewel of the American biomedical research system. However, a recent Pew Research Center study shows that only about 25% of Americans have a “great deal of confidence” that scientists are working for the public good. Earlier implementation of the Public Access Policy will help increase public confidence in the research we fund while also ensuring that the investments made by taxpayers produce replicable, reproducible, and generalizable results that benefit all Americans.\n\nProviding speedy public access to NIH-funded results is just one of the ways we are working to earn back the trust of the American people. Trust in science is an essential element in Making America Healthy Again. As such, NIH and its research partners will continue to promote maximum transparency in all that we do.\n\nJay Bhattacharya, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nDirector, National Institutes of Health"}

Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BI\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nA data point caught my eye recently. Bots generate more internet traffic to websites than humans now, the cybersecurity company Thales says.\n\nThis is being driven by a swarm of web crawlers unleashed by Big Tech companies and AI labs, including Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, that slurp up copyrighted content for free.\n\nI've warned about these automated scrapers before. They're increasingly sophisticated and persistent in their quest to harvest information to feed the insatiable demand for AI training datasets. These bots not only take data without permission or payment but also cause traffic surges in some parts of the internet, increasing costs for website owners and content creators.\n\nThankfully, there's a new way to thwart this bot swarm. If you're struggling to block them, you can send them down new digital rabbit holes where they ingest content garbage. One software developer recently called this \"diabolical\" — in a good way.\n\nAbsolutely diabolical Cloudflare feature. love to see it pic.twitter.com/k8WX2PdANN — hibakod (@hibakod) April 25, 2025\n\nIt's called AI Labyrinth, and it's a tool from Cloudflare. Described as a \"new mitigation approach,\" AI Labyrinth uses generative AI not to inform but to mislead. When Cloudflare detects unauthorized activity, typically from bots ignoring \"no crawl\" directives, it deploys a trap: a maze of convincingly real but irrelevant AI-generated content designed to waste bots' time and chew through AI companies' computing power.\n\nCloudflare pledged in a recent announcement that this is only the first iteration of using generative artificial intelligence to thwart bots.\n\nDigital gibberish\n\nUnlike traditional honeypots, AI Labyrinth creates entire networks of linked pages invisible to humans but highly attractive to bots. These decoy pages don't affect search engine optimization and aren't indexed by search engines. They are specifically tailored to bots, which get ensnared in a meaningless loop of digital gibberish.\n\nWhen bots follow the maze deeper, they inadvertently reveal their behavior, allowing Cloudflare to fingerprint and catalog them. These data points feed directly into Cloudflare's evolving machine learning models, strengthening future detection for customers.\n\nWill Allen, the vice president of product at Cloudflare, told me that more than 800,000 domains had fired up the company's general AI bot blocking tool. AI Labyrinth is the next weapon to wield when sneaky AI companies get around blockers.\n\nCloudflare hasn't released data on how many customers use AI Labyrinth, which suggests it's too early for major adoption. \"It's still very new, so we haven't released that particular data point yet,\" Allen said.\n\nI asked him why AI bots are still so active if most of the internet's data has already been scraped for model training.\n\n\"New content,\" Allen said. \"If I search for 'what are the best restaurants in San Francisco,' showing high-quality content from the past week is much better than information from a year or two prior that might be out of date.\"\n\nTurning AI against itself\n\nBots are not just scraping old blog posts; they're hungry for the freshest data to keep AI outputs relevant.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nCloudflare's strategy flips this demand on its head. Instead of serving up valuable new content to unauthorized scrapers, it offers them an endless buffet of synthetic articles, each more irrelevant than the last.\n\nAs AI scrapers become more common, innovative defenses like AI Labyrinth are becoming essential. By turning AI against itself, Cloudflare has introduced a clever layer of defense that doesn't just block bad actors but also exhausts them.\n\nFor web admins, enabling AI Labyrinth is as easy as toggling a switch on the Cloudflare dashboard. It's a small step that could make a big difference in protecting original content from unauthorized exploitation in the age of AI."}

There was a lot of interesting topics in April from the launch of the Framework Laptop 13 powered by AMD Strix Point, an interesting and cheap RISC-V board coming about, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 proving to be an interesting low-power Linux laptop, Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora 42 releasing, and much more.Below is a recap of all the interesting highlights for April 2025 on Phoronix. Before getting to those most popular articles for the month, it's time for the usual reminder... If you enjoy the original Linux/open-source-focused content put out each and every single day on Phoronix, please consider showing your support or at least not using any ad-blocker when viewing this site. Subscribing to Phoronix Premium allows for viewing multi-page articles on a single page, ad-free experience, native dark mode, and other benefits while supporting this site. Tips via PayPal and Stripe also are graciously accepted. Today's macro environment only continues to add more pressure on the already tight web ad-based publishing industry, especially for the Linux niche where relying entirely on ad networks for the ad fill. Rampant ad-block use is a persistent sword in my side and just makes it all the more challenging for those looking at Phoronix for Linux hardware reviews, often exclusive performance tests, and other content seldom found elsewhere. Thanks for your support as Phoronix approaches its 21st birthday next month.With that out of the way, the most popular featured articles/reviews for April included:Today the review embargo lifts on the Framework 13 with AMD Ryzen AI 300 \"Strix Point\" SoCs: wow, what an upgrade! I've spent the past week testing out the Framework 13 with the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and it's been terrific. Framework 13's modularity continues to pay off and allows easily upgrading to the new Strix Point bearing motherboard with AMD Zen 5 CPU cores and the Radeon 890M (RDNA 3.5) integrated graphics. If you are on a fresh Linux distribution the support is in great shape and paired with great performance for delivering a great 2025 Linux laptop option.The Framework Laptop 13 with AMD Strix Point is now shipping that as detailed in our review earlier this month can provide for a very capable Linux laptop for Linux developers, creators, and enthusiasts. But for those hesitant about the high price and still weeks away before they have shipped all their pre-orders, if you are principally concerned about battery life, and/or after proven build quality backed by on-site warranty and other warranty/support options, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition ends up being a solid option for a very reliable and well-engineered laptop for Linux use. Here is a look at the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition on Linux that is powered by Intel Lunar Lake.With both Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora 42 releasing this month you may be curious how these two Linux distributions are competing for performance. Well, it's a very tight race for common Intel/AMD x86_64 hardware. In this article are some benchmarks looking at clean installs of Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora Workstation 42 on AMD Strix Point.Last week I posted some initial GNOME 48 and KDE Plasma 6.3 desktop gaming benchmarks on Ubuntu 25.04 beta for looking at the performance of those two leading desktop options for this upcoming Ubuntu Linux release. Both GNOME and KDE under Wayland were outperforming KDE on X11 (and GNOME on X11 wasn't even working due to bugs). Some Phoronix readers questioned though whether the Wayland advantage on GNOME/KDE was due to those desktops losing focus on X11 support or if they are just too bloated. So for adding some additional context, here are some graphics/gaming benchmarks on the same system hardware/software when adding in the Xfce 4.20 and LXQt 2.1 X11 desktops.Earlier this month was a look at the AMD RDNA 3.5 graphics between Windows 11 and Ubuntu 25.04 using a Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 \"Strix Point\" SoC within a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6. That was an interesting benchmark battle and providing a fresh look at the open-source AMD Linux graphics driver stack relative to Radeon Software on Windows. For those curious about the current Zen 5(C) performance, today's article are all of the CPU benchmarks for the AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 performance under the newly-released Ubuntu 25.04 and Windows 11 as pre-loaded by Lenovo.For those that are curious about the Linux support and performance of the AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 laptop processor, I've recently been testing it out within a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 (AMD) laptop. Up today are benchmarks of the Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 within the ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 up against an assortment of other recent Intel and AMD laptops all while running the near-final state of Ubuntu 25.04.Earlier this month Canonical announced Ubuntu Linux support for the Orange Pi RV2 as a low-cost RISC-V developer board. The Orange Pi RV2 with eight RISC-V cores and 8GB of RAM costs just around $64 USD. The price point and specs were interesting that I ordered one and have been running performance benchmarks on it since for seeing how capable this is as finally an interesting, low-cost and readily available RISC-V board.Today's Linux benchmarking at Phoronix is looking at how the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K performance has evolved since its launch last October. Taking the launch-day benchmarks from October with the same hardware, we are revisiting the Intel Arrow Lake performance under Linux today using the newest system BIOS and the newly-released Ubuntu 25.04 for seeing how the performance has evolved roughly over the past half-year.Earlier this week the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti launched and there were launch-day Linux CUDA/OpenCL compute benchmarks on Phoronix. But for the Linux gaming performance tests we were waiting on a new supported driver release, which happened to be on launch day with the NVIDIA 575.51.02 Linux beta. Now that the gaming-ready Linux driver is available for the GeForce RTX 5060 series, here are some initial benchmarks of the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB up against other NVIDIA GeForce and AMD Radeon graphics cards using the newly-released Ubuntu 25.04.This week Intel announced \"200S Boost\" for Core Ultra \"Arrow Lake\" K-Series desktop processors as effectively a new overclocking profile rolling out to existing Z890 motherboards via a BIOS update. Enabling the 200S Boost profile is said to help with low-latency workloads like gaming by allowing higher fabric / die-to-die / memory frequencies. While some Windows benchmarks have begun emerging for the Intel 200S Boost mode and some limited gains, I was curious about the performance under Linux so here are some 200S Boost benchmarks with the Core Ultra 9 285K on Ubuntu 25.04.And the most viewed news for the month:Linus Torvalds is sharing some of his classic and straight-to-the-point wisdom today over file-systems with case-folding / case-insensitive file and folder support.AMD has published as open-source their \"GPU-IOV Module\" used for virtualization with Instinct accelerators. It's also reported on their roadmap for bringing virtualization support to their client (Radeon) discrete GPUs.Arch Linux is the latest Linux distribution replacing its Redis packages with the Valkey fork.Well here is a pleasant surprise, especially for those that recall the days long ago where Fedora Linux releases tend to be notoriously delayed... Fedora 42 is cleared for releasing next week Tuesday, 15 April, in meeting its \"early target\" release date.APT 3.0 has been officially released as the first stable version following an interesting development cycle. APT 3.0 has been dedicated to the late Steve Langasek with his many Debian and Ubuntu contributions over the years.It's been a very exciting week in the KDE Plasma space with the start of a big new feature landing for the Plasma 6.4 desktop.Fedora 42 is out today as a fabulous update to this prominent leading-edge Linux distribution sponsored by Red Hat. I've been running Fedora 42 on several systems already -- including upgrading my main production system to it -- and it's been working out very well. Fedora 42 is packed full of new features and software updates making it a great H1'2025 Linux operating system release.Following the COSMIC Alpha 6 release from February, System76 today released COSMIC Alpha 7 as their last planned alpha release for this open-source, Rust-written desktop environment designed around the needs of their Pop!_OS Linux distribution.GNOME 48 made Decibels the desktop's official audio player and in doing so also became the first GNOME core application written in the TypeScript porting language. There's now a second core app for GNOME written in TypeScript.KDE developers continue to be very busy working toward the Plasma 6.4 desktop release and making other enhancements throughout this open-source desktop.Last year work on KDE's Amarok music player was resurrected after a six year development hiatus. With the return to Amarok development it was ported to Qt6 and KDE Frameworks 5. At the end of last year Amarok 3.2 released with initial Qt6 and KDE Frameworks 6 support while retaining Qt5/KF5 support. Now out today is the Amarok 3.3 beta to drop that prior-generation support.After several ROCm 6.3 point releases, AMD today rolled out ROCm 6.4 as the next update to their open-source GPU/accelerator compute stack and ahead of their big Advancing AI event in June where they will talk about future ROCm work.As a win for the open-source community from NVIDIA, the company recently announced they are making their PhysX and Flow GPU-accelerated source code open-source.For those looking to replace their proprietary BIOS with the open-source Coreboot on a supported platform or are already doing so, Coreboot 25.03 is out today to provide the newest capabilities for this open-source BIOS/firmware solution.Sven Peter who remains one of the very active Asahi Linux developers and working on upstreaming various elements of Apple Silicon support for the Linux kernel has sent up warning flares around the eventual Apple M4 support.Valve and CodeWeavers today announced the much anticipated beta release of Proton 10.0 as the newest version of their downstream version of Wine that powers Steam Play for running Windows games on Linux.Back in March some ideas were talked about by Canonical engineers for Ubuntu Linux to move to Rust Coreutils and other Rust-written system components. Some of this is likely to materialize for the Ubuntu 25.10 release due out in October to allow for sufficient testing ahead of the all important Ubuntu 26.04 LTS release next year. Today the more solidified plans have been laid out for moving to the Rust Coreutils as a replacement to GNU Coreutils with Ubuntu 25.10.A set of Linux kernel patches posted today by longtime Linux kernel developer Ingo Molnar are looking to remove support for \"ancient\" 32-bit CPUs. In particular, if these patches are accepted, the Linux kernel would be ending support for old i486 CPUs as well as early i586 CPU models.A request for comments (RFC) patch series sent out this week for the Linux kernel is working on the notion of Virtual Swap Space support. The notion of Virtual Swap Space has been talked about for years and even going back to 2011 there's been efforts to redesign the kernel's swap cache along similar lines.Following IBM engineers doing a lot of open-source compiler work around a new \"arch15\" that we suspected to be IBM z17 with Telum II processors, this morning IBM officially announced their next-generation mainframe hardware."}

You might encounter this error as: “Wi-Fi Calling: You have registered the maximum number of devices for this service.”\n\nThis error may appear whether you have exceeded the limit or not.\n\nSometimes, it’s legitimate: You have more devices than permitted, even though this number isn’t publicized or displayed in the iPhone interface. Many carriers have a five-device total in addition to your iPhone. However, others see it when they aren’t using Wi-Fi Calling or below the limit.\n\nHere’s how many users have figured out how to solve the problem.\n\nStart with the basics\n\nWi-Fi Calling is Apple’s implementation of a clever idea that extends voice-network calling. When you place a phone call to a number using your iPhone, it typically occurs by your phone using its connection to a nearby cellular tower, which patches it into the public switched telephone network (PSTN, if you like abbreviations).\n\nApple lets you set your iPhone so that your other devices connected to the same iCloud account can place cellular calls via your iPhone as long as they are both nearby (within Bluetooth range to detect proximity) and connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Those details are to ensure quality.\n\nWi-Fi Calling takes that a step further. With this feature enabled, your iPhone and other devices skip the cellular link and use Wi-Fi to connect over the Internet to the carrier’s calling hub and, from there, out to the PSTN to complete the call. The advantage of Wi-Fi Calling is that your other devices don’t need to be near your iPhone to place a call.\n\nYou can enable Wi-Fi Calling in Settings > Cellular > Wi-Fi Calling. First, turn on Wi-Fi Calling on This iPhone. Then enable Add Wi-Fi Calling For Other Devices. (If the feature doesn’t appear in Settings > Cellular under your carrier’s section, check whether your provider offers the feature. If it does, call your carrier to see if they can fix the problem.)\n\nSolving the limit warning\n\nYou can try to solve the problem causing the “maximum number of devices” error by changing the state of Wi-Fi Calling. It seems that each device registers with the carrier’s network, and carriers’ systems don’t always update immediately.

Yes, but for Windows Server 2025, not Windows 11.", "fullContent": "IT admins have a new update option rolling out for Windows Server 2025 in July.\n\nMicrosoft is launching a paid subscription for Windows security updates, but the cost will hit those running Windows Server 2025, not Windows 11. Hotpatching for Windows Server 2025 has been free while in preview, but when the option leaves preview in July, it will cost $1.50 per CPU core per month.\n\nI suspect many who manage servers already know about the change coming in July and whether it will affect their organization. The problem is that this story made the rounds because some outlets used — dare I say — clickbait headlines that suggested PC owners may have to pay for Windows 11 security updates starting this summer.\n\nBut if you're an admin who manages servers and is curious about the change, I'll cover that as well.\n\nWhat is hotpatching a server?\n\nWindows Server 2025 Hotpatching: Quick Introduction - YouTube Watch On\n\nHotpatching is a way to update a server without having to reboot after installation. This is important because it minimizes the time servers are unprotected.\n\nIt's common for a fix to be delayed while a server waits to be rebooted. During that time between installation and the reboot, known as the \"window of vulnerability,\" the server is left vulnerable even though a fix is available.\n\nHotpatching in Windows Server 2025 will reduce the number of times you need to restart servers to around four times per year. That leaves some windows of vulnerability, but far fewer than if you had to restart a server each month.\n\nTo use hotpatching in multicloud or on-premises environments, you need to use Azure Arc. With Azure Arc, you can manage an environment by projecting non-Azure or on-premises resources into Azure Resource Manager.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

The upcoming July launch is for Windows Server 2025, which allows Microsoft to offer hotpatching for non-Azure servers that are connected with Azure Arc.\n\nMicrosoft's announcement post about hotpatching for Windows Server 2025 outlines how to enable it and links to several guides.\n\nIn what appears to be an effort to generate clicks, some outlets have covered the Windows Server 2025 subscription requirement while omitting key details from headlines. I've seen several social media posts and articles that only mention \"Windows\" when discussing the upcoming $1.50 per CPU core per month fee.\n\nSince Windows 10 support ends in October, there will be some people who will pay for continued support. But that's entirely separate from the server news.\n\nWindows 11 security updates are not going to cost money come July 1, 2025 or at any point this year. They'll continue to roll out as usual.\n\nWhile personal computing is unaffected by this news, there's some justified pushback against pricing for hotpatching Windows Server 2025. The fact that the subscription charges per CPU core means costs could add up quickly."}

I’d wanted a ride-on lawnmower for years, ever since my brothers and I found and restored-to-life a John Deere we found in the garage of a rental house in rural France. (The elderly neighbour, after observing from behind her lace curtains, came over to our yard once we got it running, after days or weeks of tinkering, to accuse us of wasting gas joyriding it around the driveway.) So, when one turned up at the local Canadian second hand store for $50, I bought it, along with a big bottle of slimy green goo to put into the flat tires to make them leak more slowly. Once I got it running, I spray-painted orange highlights that were widely regarded as an aesthetic disaster, and rode it gleefully around the field.\n\nNot only were the blades not in use: they didn’t even work. Mathilde would not approve.\n\nThis machine had two speeds, labelled with a tortoise icon, and a hare icon. There may have been gradations between them, but what I liked to do was to putz along contemplatively in a cloud of fumes on tortoise mode, and then — with a dramatic flourish, as if I was a race car driver coming out of a brakestand — slam the lever full-ahead.\n\nFor a moment, nothing would happen. Then the engine would seem to lose power — anticlimax — before coughing and spluttering at the new fuel/air mixture, roaring to life at a new pitch, and accelerating with sufficient vigour to throw me back in my seat with a pleasant whiplash-like effect, and render bumps and potholes thrilling, fenceposts perilous, hearing useless, and grin enormous.\n\nToday I am in tortoise mode.\n\nI am writing this in a notebook, with a fountain pen that clogs and must be shaken, while drinking tea and listening to Mozart. Each word arrives slowly, between moments staring out the window at the fir tree blowing in the wind, trying to find the right way to put it.\n\nThe words do not pour out of me: they are wrung out one by one. When I surface, I can feel my face scrunched into a 5th-grader’s look of tongue-out concentration.\n\nThis might seem like a waste of effort. Why deliberately slow down the process?\n\n(See this footnote for an 800-word analogy about brewing tea →: )\n\nStudents learn better when they take notes by hand, because they have to summarize to keep up. When I write longhand, I have to mull over what I’m trying to say, and distil it into as few pen strokes as possible, rather than putting it down the way it first comes to mind.\n\nFor the past three days I’ve been attempting to get into Hare mode. It’s just not working. Modes have momentum, and inertia. And there’s a whiff of the old bootstrap paradox. Hare mode is both caused by, and causes, its correlates: early mornings, sleep deprivation, talking loud and fast, socializing, high-energy music, drinking too much coffee.\n\nMy physiotherapist told me to lean forward when I run, so that I am continuously falling and catching myself.\n\nThis is what Hare mode feels like.\n\nHare mode is like a noisy bar. Tortoise mode is a library. Both have their function; and what one encourages is impossible at the other.\n\nSwitching modes is a bit like throwing the throttle lever forward on my ride-on mower. One applies gas and air to the engine, and waits.\n\nRight now, I’m somewhere between the “total loss of power” and “engine coughing and spluttering” phases. Any minute, I expect to be thrown back in my seat.\n\nIt might seem that Hare mode, as the higher-energy state, would be harder to transition to. But— it isn’t?\n\nThis essay is the result of a deliberate and effortful transition to Tortoise mode.\n\nMy last essay went somewhat viral and my server went down from the traffic. Our email list, built over a decade of blogging, doubled in a month. At the same time, I landed a big contract, got complimentary emails from people with their own Wikipedia articles, broke my long distance running record, and had music industry showcases and consultations. In my own small way, I felt like a big shot.\n\nIt had gotten to the point where I was glued to my stats — are people talking about me on the internet?! No? Well, what about now? — and sharing my successes with a frequency that was getting braggy.\n\nI would wake up in the night and refresh Grafana to make sure my site wasn’t down, and that the CPU wasn’t throttled, or system load increasing suspiciously (there seemed to be a memory leak somewhere, and like the consummate professional that I am, I would just reboot the server when it started acting up, because that was more reliable than trying to do surgery while it was under load).\n\nIt was Sunday morning. I used to take an offline day once a week. Somehow, the habit had slipped.\n\nI felt like spending another day in front of my huge monitor being awesome.\n\nBut I’d noticed success begat a manic energy that could easily become addictive and self-perpetuating. Unchecked, it was a feedback loop: the flywheel of activity would beget more success, and more activity, and more stress.\n\nIt had been fun, and fulfilling. I sat down to reply to emails, and after an hour, discovered that I had lost ground. I used exclamation marks, and it felt sincere. I learned a lot.\n\nBut did I want to live like that? No. I know people who live like that, and the trade-offs don’t seem worth it.\n\nSo I forced myself to take a break. I scaled down the server so it would stop charging me overage, and shut down my computer.\n\nMy “success”, such as it was, was not the result of gawking at Grafana dashboards, rapid-fire emailing, and tailing server logs.\n\nNo. That essay was born of tedium, contemplation, and long discussions of dishwasher pump repair held beside a crackling wood fire in a house with no indoor toilet.\n\nThe previous essay that made the HackerNews frontpage was written, meditatively, in a tiny rain-soaked pocket notebook, over the course of multiple muddy meandering bike rides through the city.\n\nMy first three works of fiction to be published in magazines were written (1) in a notebook at a coffeeshop open mic, and then in the same notebook with my feet on my desk, or (2, 3) on a donated 75-year-old typewriter, while sitting cross-legged on a rock outside my tent.\n\nIt’s not that I didn’t write on my computer; I often did. It just wasn’t as good.\n\nI don’t know if the process qualifies as “slow productivity”, but it’s definitely slow.\n\nI think of this oscillation between living in the slow lane and the fast lane as akin to running a wood stove without burning down the house.\n\nIf you run an old woodstove wide-open for too long, you’re liable to burn up the firebrick inside, and quite possibly set the wood panelling smoking.\n\nBut if you keep a woodstove damped down all the time, soot builds up in the chimney, and eventually you get a chimney fire.\n\nA feature of my childhood was occasionally getting the stove good and roaring, till the cook surface began to glow, to blow the soot out. (Before my time, the soot in the chimney had caught fire once or twice; this was a tradition born of experience.)\n\nIt seems there is a parallel between woodstoves and human beings.\n\nSo far, I’ve mostly been talking about tortoise mode, as if it was the good mode that we need more of. But it takes both modes to live life well. I don’t think the parable of the tortoise and the hare is the whole truth. We’re not the tortoise or the hare: we are the tortoise and the hare. The question is which champion to bring out for which race.\n\nThe problem with tortoise mode is that it is very slow and resource-intensive. It’s hard to live exclusively in tortoise mode and feel fulfilled and effective.\n\nSo let’s talk about Hare mode. What is it, and what is it good for?\n\nIf tortoise mode is steering, hare mode is throttle. If tortoise mode is being, hare mode is doing. Hare mode executes the tortoise mode vision.\n\nTortoise mode isn’t great for getting anything non-contemplative done. For every monk who meditates and teaches at a retreat centre, there are usually multiple administrators scurrying around, taking care of the arrangements. Neither role would exist without the other.\n\nOnce again, I have made hare mode seem less cool. But I think the mode I’m in colours my outlook. And this is tortoise mode talking, sunlight streaming in, Bach on the stereo, wool sweater, weak Heicha sipped from thrift store bone china.\n\nAsk the guy in the too-tight tee about Hare mode , and the answer, if you can hear it over the opening riff of Kansas’ Carry on Wayward Son, will be quite different.\n\nSince I’m not that guy, and indeed, scarcely know him, let’s talk about the failure modes of hare mode. (The failure modes of tortoise are boring: sluggishness, hibernation, getting behind, reacting so slowly that it’s no longer relevant.)\n\nI live beside an old seaside highway. At night, at around 2AM, when there’s no traffic and the bars empty out, this scenic old 2-lane highway transmogrifies into an illicit racetrack. The Mustangs come out to play, and Pontiac Firebirds with V8 engines herniated through the hood deposit rubber on the pavement and smoke in the air.\n\nFor some reason, my town suffers from an infestation of Ford GT Mustangs. It’s as if there were a stud farm breeding the things. My hypothesis is that there are a lot of well-off people with poor taste, and the Mustang is the cheapest expensive car on the market. The noise per dollar of the machine is the best bargain this side of jackhammers and dynamite.\n\nWhen you hear the muscle cars tearing down the strip in the middle of the night, and listen to the Doppler effect of each roaring engine and set of tuned pipes — or, as the case may be, deliberately untuned pipes — one imagines they must be going fast enough to mow down the row of small poplars and take out a whole city block if they lost control. It seems a miracle we don’t find wreckage on Sunday morning.\n\nThe other day I was coming home from town on my bicycle, and heard the throaty, many-cylindered roar of a Mustang approaching from ahead. I pulled farther from the road, comforted that there was a sturdy stoplight post between me and the oncoming beast, and peered around the corner ahead, expecting it to shoot into view being driven at reckless speed, possibly on fire with James Bond clinging to the trunk and a squad of police cars in pursuit. The noise of the oncoming car kept getting louder, but it never came into view. Then suddenly I spotted it. It was right in front of me, in the congestion at the stop light, hardly moving at all.\n\nThe moral of the story: the loudest car isn’t necessarily the fastest. Sometimes the bark is worse than the bite.\n\nI think there’s a parallel among intellectuals. The best thinkers often seem to be the Toyota Corolla style; the Lamborghini-brains never seem to really get anywhere; they are too busy being impressed by all the noise they are making.\n\nI don’t mean to knock Mustangs, or sports car people. The film Ford v Ferrari (2019) gave me a sense of how car racing could be an almost transcendent art. And I met a kind museum curator and palæontologist whose son built out a custom 1980 Firebird for him when he was very ill, as a get-well wish, and who admitted to smoking the pavement on my very street during an unauthorized, unorganized race. The person in the driver’s seat of a classic jerk-mobile might be anything but. They might be a softspoken cancer survivor, cradled in a ~300hp love letter, finding joy on borrowed time.\n\nContext also matters. A GT40 could smoke a Ferrari on the track. But in bad traffic, I could probably beat a Mustang into town on my 50-year-old Peugeot road bike.\n\nHare mode is about getting from A to B without farting around or wasting time. It isn’t about the route taken, or the equipment used. Spoilers are optional.\n\nSometimes, even with Hare mode — especially with Hare mode — going smart is more important than going fast. Look for paper walls and chalk on the floor . Embrace that hacker mindset and find function from form. Use the pedestrian-controlled crosswalks.\n\nNature figured this out billions of years ago. Each season, microscopic or macroscopic, creates the conditions for the next. So it is with life at all scales. Why would I be the exception?\n\nI feel a mischievous hankering to hop on my bicycle and go race some Mustangs."}

It’s Google’s response to services like Anthropic, which “answer” queries using AI, which slurps up and regurgitates answers that others have already provided.\n\nGoogle first began revamping its search algorithm in 2023, when it started aggregating AI-powered summaries of say, the best laptops. AI has been used elsewhere by Google services like Chrome to sum up web pages, as well. (The Department of Justice is attempting to break up Google, including spin off its Chrome browser, as punishment for forming what it calls an illegal monopoly.) Now, AI Mode is another attempt by Google to step in and interject its own results when users begin searching for a query.\n\nOn a desktop PC, AI Mode places the source of Google’s answer to the right, in several visual links. But the information that the user is searching for is culled into the left-hand column. While occasionally a site may be called out as a source for information, any links to the source of the content are left as tiny, monochrome “chainlinks” at the end of the individual summaries.\n\nAt least for now, AI Mode doesn’t provide a list of blue links or any sign of a traditional search page — it’s whatever Google itself has curated, and nothing more.\n\nFoundry\n\nThe “clock” icon to the left reveals queries you’ve made before, so Google will understand your preference for a given topic.\n\nUnfortunately, Google doesn’t really draw a visual distinction between a site that has spent hours testing products, and those which, well, haven’t. You either have to simply trust Google’s expertise, or visually hunt and track the link icon — which is now about the size of the “X” buttons to close an annoying popup. Google obviously believes that you simply won’t bother, which itself is probably just another depressing sign of the times."}

Both the color and monochrome version of the Boox Mira Pro include warm and cold lighting options to suit your own preferences.\n\nThe tradeoff is that an e-ink monitor is the anti-gaming display; e-ink is designed for a low refresh rate.

Boox, however, says that this is possible, and that the display includes four dedicated refresh modes, including one designed for watching videos.\n\nLike the Boox Mira Pro, the color version ships with a ton of ports: HDMI, miniHDMI, USB-C, DisplayPort, even a VESA interface.\n\nI have no idea what it would be like to work with an e-ink display for your PC.

It’s a technique that uses a sort of “oven” to attach components to multiple points at once, and it’s much faster than doing individual solder points either by hand or with robotics. In addition to eliminating mistakes and returns, it speeds things up—apparently by 15 percent for the Pi.

Google’s John Mueller recently said that EEAT is not something that you can add to a site and most of what was discussed on the show lines up perfectly with that reality.\n\nThe podcast, hosted by Olesia Korobka and Anton Shulke, featured Amanda Walls (LinkedIn profile), founder of Cedarwood Digital in Manchester, UK.\n\nAristotle And SEO\n\nAmanda introduced the concept of applying Aristotle’s principles of ethos, pathos, and logos to SEO strategy. These principles are three ways to persuade site visitors and potential customers:\n\nCredibility (ethos) Emotional appeal (pathos) Logical reasoning (logos), which is used to convince an audience.\n\nAmanda explains these concepts in more depth but those three principles form the basis for her approach to creating the circumstances that lead to positive external signals that can be correlated to concepts like expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.\n\nWhy It Matters for SEO\n\nAmanda says that SEO is ultimately about driving leads and conversions, not just rankings and I agree with that 100%. The history of SEO is littered with gurus crowing about all the traffic they gained for clients but they never talk about the part that really matters which is sales and leads.\n\nLink building historically falls into that trap where both the client and the link builder focus on how many links are acquired each month and look to traffic as evidence of success. But really, as Amanda points out, everything that a good SEO does should be focused on increasing sales. Nothing else matters.\n\nAmanda explained:\n\n“SEO is more than just rankings, it’s about conversion. It’s about business return. It’s about getting that success, those leads, those sales that we need… Bringing people to a website ….means nothing if they don’t convert. …we don’t just want to bring people to the website, we want them to engage and love your brand and have a really, really good reason to go through and fulfill the conversion journey.”\n\nReputation Management\n\nAmanda recommends focusing on managing the business’s reputation, such as in reviews, interviews, and what’s written online about the brand.\n\nShe cites the following statistics:\n\n87% of consumers will back out of a purchase decision if they read something negative about the brand.\n\n81% of consumers do extensive research before a purchase, as much as 79 days.\n\nAmanda prescribes findability, credibility, and persuasion as the ingredients for successful search optimization:\n\n“We’re working on SEO to help people find us, and then most importantly, we are convincing them or we’re persuading them to actually go and purchase our product…”\n\nMonitor Off-Site Signals\n\nAmanda recommends regularly researching your brand to uncover potential issues, to monitor the online user sentiment, and to assess media coverage because poor off-site sentiment can remove users out of the conversion funnel.\n\nManage On-Site Signals\n\nAmanda also recommends using the About Us page for sharing relatable stories that users can generate actual positive feelings for the brand, using the phrase emotional appeal to describe the experience users should get from an About Us page. She says that this can be as simple as telling potential customers about the business.\n\nUser-Generated Content And Authenticity\n\nMany of the fastest growing business on the Internet cultivate high quality user generated content. Encouraging customers to post reviews and images helps to build confidence in products.\n\nAmanda explains:\n\n“And then also from a pathos perspective, you know, really getting that kind of user generated content, getting people to connect… because fundamentally humans, they buy from humans and the more human and the more emotional that we can be in our sales process, the more likely that we are to get that buy-in and that connection that we need to actually get across to our audience.”\n\nPitching To Journalists\n\nThis last part, pitching story ideas to journalists, is something that link building companies consistently get wrong. I know because I get approached by them all the time and they consistently have the wrong approach, which is focusing too much on links and not enough on understanding my audience.\n\nI specialized in link building back in the early days of SEO (early 2000s). I was even the moderator of the link building forum at WebmasterWorld. Although I don’t do link building anymore, I have a vast, vast amount of experience persuading publishers to give my clients a link.\n\nMy opinion is that PR to journalists should be approached strictly for brand exposure. Don’t make links the goal.\n\nFocus instead on building positive stories with journalists and let them write those articles with or without adding a link, let them decide. What will happen is that the consumers will go out and type your business’s name into Google and that’s a strong, strong signal. I prefer thousands of consumers typing my website’s name on Google over a handful of links, every time, all day long.\n\nI strongly agree with what Amanda says about understanding a journalist’s audience:\n\n“92% of journalists say that understanding their audience is crucial for them to consider a story pitch.”\n\nUnderstanding the audience is super important. I’ll go even deeper and recommend understanding what motivates the audience. Focus on the reasons why a journalist’s readers will click an article title that’s displayed on Google News. Once you understand that part, I can practically guarantee that PR outreach approval rates will skyrocket.\n\nTakeaway\n\nThe SEO Charity podcast episode featuring Amanda Walls introduces a novel way to build signals associated with Google’s EEAT (expertise, experience, authoritativeness, trustworthiness) by focusing on credibility, emotion, and logic in content strategy. Walls emphasizes using Aristotle’s persuasive principles to influence reputation, brand perception, and conversion, encouraging SEO strategies focused on meaningful business outcomes like leads and sales, with better search visibility that supports those ends.\n\nWatch the SEO Charity episode on EEAT:\n\nReimagining E-E-A-T with Amanda Walls\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Ollyy"}

But even smaller companies are jumping into the OLED gaming monitor market because it’s so hot right now! Combine an in-demand segment with a budget brand and you get a solid deal—like this 27-inch OLED gaming monitor for $479.99.\n\nThe AOC Agon Pro AG276QZD2 is a pretty typical gaming monitor with what I’m assuming is the same 1440p 240Hz panel we’ve seen on a lot of other 27-inch offerings. But that doesn’t make it any less worthy. At that speed and with a 0.03-millisecond response time plus compatibility with Nvidia G-Sync, it’s a great choice if you play fast-paced multiplayer games. And of course the perfect blacks and vivid colors of OLED will make single-player games sparkle, too. It has VESA mount compatibility, so you could use some of the money you save for a monitor arm.\n\nThis monitor includes two HDMI and two DisplayPort, um, ports, but its other connections are limited to two USB-A ports and a headphone jack. At this price, you can’t really complain about limited options—anything else on the market will run you a couple hundred bucks more.\n\nAmazon is listing this as a “limited-time deal,” presumably as part of its Gaming Week sale. That being said, I wouldn’t count on a super-low-priced OLED like this staying in stock for too long. If it’s not to your liking, then check out PCWorld’s picks for the best gaming monitors.\n\nSnag this 27-inch 1440p OLED gaming monitor for under $500"}

(I sat in on a pentesting session during the RSAC’s cybersecurity conference this week, and I don’t envy them their jobs.) But not all of it is—especially when it comes to big wins for us everyday users.\n\nSo, see this?\n\nThis account type is a security problem. PCWorld\n\nThat is what David Weston, CVP of Enterprise and OS Security at Microsoft, says is the biggest security threat to your PC.\n\nThe reason: Admin permissions are a major opportunity for hackers. Think of it like your house—once someone’s inside, they can go into any part of it and mess around. In particular, if you use an Administrator account daily, then remote access to your PC is possible—and those two things combined can enable real damage. Hackers can not only slip into your PC, but they can also spy on you, add software to your system, run malicious code, change software settings, and more.\n\nThe solution: In your Windows settings (“Accounts”), create a separate local Administrator account with a strong, unique password. Whenever you need higher-level permissions, you’ll be prompted for your admin account’s password. (You won’t need to log out of your normal account, so it’s pretty seamless.)\n\nNext, downgrade your existing account to a Standard user. It’s a quick change and easy to do.\n\nCreate additional users on this screen. Once done, you must elevate the account’s permissions from Standard User to Administrator. PCWorld\n\nYou can reference our past guide on how to create the new Administrator account and downgrade your existing account to a standard user for step-by-step instructions. While it refers to Windows 10, I’ve verified the instructions apply to Windows 11, too.\n\nOnce you complete these tasks, you’re good to go. For something so big, the fix is pretty small."}

Lenovo showed off the newest members of the L-series and P-series laptops to the video team, and they were eager to get their hands on those iconic TrackPoint nubbins, whose death has been greatly exaggerated. You can come along in the latest PCWorld video on YouTube.\n\nThe first entry is the new ThinkPad L13, one of the cheapest ThinkPads available, which now comes in both a standard clamshell and 2-in-1 (AKA Yoga) form factor. New for this fifth generation is the Communications Bar, a little extended lip on the top of the lid that houses the camera and other sensors, as well as functioning as a handy grip for opening the laptop. The 13-inch, 16:10 screen is, naturally, touch-sensitive on the 2-in-1 model.\n\nThis design has a refreshed keyboard (with the correct Ctrl and Fn button locations), double USB-C (Thunderbolt 4) and USB-A ports, and a full-sized HDMI. Based on the Core Ultra Arrow Lake platform, you can get a maximum of 32GB of soldered RAM, but the 42mm SSD is user-accessible and swappable along with other parts like the battery. Hooray for repair and upgrade options.\n\nThe slightly more premium P series is represented by the 14-inch ThinkPad P14s, now in its sixth generation. This one comes with AMD Strix Point or Intel Arrow Lake-H processor options and an upgraded OLED panel, even on a non-touch display. A little extra room in the chassis means a collapsible Ethernet port on top of the other ports available on the L13. We don’t know the specific prices or release dates on these new laptops, but they should be out sometime later this year.\n\nFor more hands-on looks at the latest laptops, be sure to subscribe to PCWorld on YouTube, and check out our weekly podcast The Full Nerd."}

Last week, the company published a new blog post (spotted by Windows Central) that shamelessly promotes its new Copilot+ PCs as the way forward for users still on older Windows 10 PCs that aren’t eligible for the Windows 11 upgrade.\n\nAmong other things, Microsoft is trying to entice you with brand-new AI features such as Recall, which takes periodic screenshots of your screen, analyzes it using AI, then indexes it so you can search through all your past PC activity at a later time. Another big benefit touted in the blog post is that Copilot+ PCs are purported to be up to five times faster than a five-year-old Windows device, with enhanced security features on top.\n\nYet, while Copilot+ PCs are certainly novel and do offer plenty of benefits in the battery life and performance departments, they’re still in need of some serious improvements. And features like Recall remain controversial for their privacy and security concerns, so much so that we don’t entirely trust it—Recall is too risky and you should turn it off.\n\nMicrosoft is officially ending support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. After that, the operating system will no longer receive any new security updates, which means it will become increasingly unsafe to use as it grows more vulnerable to malware and hackers.\n\nWhat can you do if you’re still on Windows 10? One option is to upgrade to Windows 11 for free if your PC meets the requirements. If it doesn’t, Microsoft simply won’t let you upgrade (and wants you to buy a Copilot+ PC in its place). Your other options include paying to extend Windows 10 support, switching to Linux, or staying on Windows 10 post-support and dealing with all the risks. Learn more about that in our article on how to keep your Windows 10 PC going after end-of-support."}

I did so because the letter represents an authoritarian threat to science, and I knew it wasn’t an isolated, bizarre incident. It is a warning sign, another move in a broader campaign to exert control over research, medicine and media.\n\nThe letter asserts that “publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.” It was written by recently appointed acting U.S. attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr., who gives no examples that might demonstrate partisanship; nor does he cite any laws or legal principles to indicate a matter that should concern the U.S. government. Instead, without justification or jurisdiction over a private medical journal based in Illinois, he simply invokes his federal office to demand that CHEST explain if it accepts “competing viewpoints,” and how it is now developing “new norms” to adjust its editorial methods in view of its alleged—by Martin—biases.\n\nSince I publicly shared this, at least four additional journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, have confirmed receipt of similar letters, according to MedPage Today, STAT, the New York Times and Science. Aside from Eric Rubin at the NEJM, none of the targeted editors have been willing to go on record, fearing retribution from the Trump administration. It’s likely that letters were sent to many more journals; CHEST’s was simply the first to leak.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nWhy CHEST? It’s a specialty outlet—not even among the top 50 medical journals. Is this a keyword-driven campaign like those we’ve seen at the CDC and NIH? Under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., terms like “diversity,” “minority” and “equity” have been systematically flagged. This has led to elimination of federal positions and programs, cancellation of research grants, and scrubbing of government websites and statistics—all related to these words.\n\nA search of CHEST’s archive for “transgender,” for example, returns 33 hits—articles acknowledging the clinical implications of caring for trans patients (e.g., ventilator settings may need to be adjusted). Add in other Trump-targeted terms like race, disparity, female and disability, and we can see the outlines of a new DOJ-led front in the administration’s campaign to target minorities for denial of care, legalized discrimination and bureaucratic erasure.\n\nKennedy has also previously objected to medical journals not publishing studies that support his debunked and baseless theories, such as false claims that vaccines cause autism, declaring a plan to “create our own journals” to publish such studies. Last year, while running his own presidential campaign, he stated he would take legal action against editors in response: “I’m going to litigate against you under the racketeering laws, under the general tort laws. I’m going to find a way to sue you unless you come up with a plan right now to show how you’re going to start publishing real science.” Kennedy is not a scientist and has no training in medicine. He has not volunteered to submit his claims to the types of critical, anonymized expert reviews that are designed to support scientific rigor at scientific journals.\n\nKennedy frequently makes evidence-free claims on podcasts and television shows and now in government press conferences, regardless of the consequences. However, peer-reviewed journals like CHEST require extensive scrutiny as part of their evaluation process. Outside scientists examine submitted studies for biases, errors and unsupported claims or conclusions, and authors are required to include statements about conflicts of interest—including reasons for even just the appearance of bias in the eyes of others—and to disclose their funding sources. This is routine procedure at journals, about which Martin’s letter indicates he knows strikingly little.\n\nWe don’t know Martin’s, Kennedy’s or Trump’s specific motivations in sending a letter to CHEST, but it is clear that Martin’s threat to journals is not a one-off stunt. Like Trump’s actions that cut off or threaten federal research funding at Columbia, Harvard and other universities, it appears to be part of a calculated strategy to identify, isolate and intimidate researchers who, and institutions that, acknowledge realities like inequality, social differences and structural violence.\n\nAmerican health institutions have long been entangled with state violence: forced sterilizations of Black and Indigenous women, repression of civil rights protesters, collaboration with anti-immigrant policing, the push to categorize queer people as pathological and dangerous and denial of reproductive and gender-affirming care.\n\nThese alliances are enabled by a professional culture that rewards compliance and punishes dissent. In that respect, the Trump administration’s mounting ideological control over medicine represents not a historical rupture but rather a continuation of sordid legacies.\n\nTo understand what is now transpiring, it is important to note that Martin has never before been a prosecutor. He has no experience in criminal litigation, appointed to his post to serve political ends. Since taking office, he has hired Michael Caputo—Trump’s disgraced first-term COVID spokesman who then infamously accused government scientists of “sedition”—as an adviser at the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The message is clear: this is not about law enforcement. It is about using state power to intimidate scientists and suppress dissent.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, if journal editors refuse to speak out and organize to defend academic freedom, they will not only ultimately fail to protect themselves and their journals. They will also sacrifice targeted communities.\n\nWhen confronted by government intimidation driven by personal ideological agendas instead of the public good, silence is complicity—not neutrality. We must refuse to compromise when the Trump administration comes first for stigmatized and vulnerable groups—such as trans individuals, disabled people, or immigrants they label as “criminals”—as a means of normalizing state violence and expanding its unconstitutional reach.\n\nThis is not the time to issue hollow statements condemning the supposed “politicization of science”—a line that conflates partisan interests with what should be bipartisan political principles upon which rigorous scientific practice, ethical clinical care and genuine public health depend. Science is always already political, and we must organize politically to defend it against authoritarian threats. That requires calling out the Trump administration’s intimidation campaign for what it is: a McCarthyite attempt to purge science of inconvenient truths and ethical foundations.\n\nThe production of knowledge, the allocation of care, and the very questions we ask and answer, are all shaped by systems of power. When medical professionals pretend otherwise, we create a vacuum. And that vacuum is quickly filled by the loudest ideologues and most craven opportunists.\n\nTo fight back, we need coordinated action and solidarity with those most targeted. And we need to stop pretending that defending science means staying above politics. Provoked by the revelation of Martin’s letter, the Lancet—a world-leading, London-based medical journal—has taken on this public responsibility and done what its American counterparts have so far declined to do: published a clear and forceful editorial stance condemning the Trump administration’s assault on science, medicine, and public health and calling for Kennedy’s resignation. Other journal editors and health leaders should now join in taking such principled political stands. To do so, they must give up on the naive fantasy that, if they just keep their heads low enough, they can avoid becoming targets and simply wait out the Trump administration as it destroys essential scientific infrastructure.\n\nMartin’s letter is a declaration that scientific inquiry is no longer safe unless it aligns with state ideology. If we let that stand, we don’t just lose our journals. We lose the right to ask questions that matter—and the ability to care for those most in need.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."}

The company appears to be limiting shipping to US residents to avoid tariffs.\n\nAmericans trying to buy from 8BitDo’s online store are being hit by warnings that some products simply aren’t available to ship. Polygon reports that a warning message on some products explicitly stated that shipments couldn’t be made from its warehouse in China to US residents, and only products available in US warehouses are currently shipping. But as I try to replicate the same message today, it merely says “This product is not available for delivery to your location” for one of the keyboards. 8BitDo may have softened the warning text.\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be any specific pattern to which products are available to Americans and which aren’t. The only way to figure out what’s actually available is to go through the checkout process and enter a US-based address. If you’re looking for something specific and it’s not available from 8BitDo, you might try Amazon or Best Buy in hopes that they have domestic stock. It’s not an especially elegant solution… but then again, Americans are experiencing unprecedented issues.\n\nWe’ve seen many, many companies that rely on Chinese imports and manufacturing—from smaller players like 8BitDo to notable mid-sized companies like Razer and Corsair, all the way up to giants like Acer—raise their prices or simply stop offering products in the wake of the Trump administration’s punishing tariffs and taxes. While the tariff rate on most imported products is at “just” 10 percent for a limited time, China-based imports get slapped with a 145 percent tax, more than doubling their cost, or higher in some cases based on their raw material contents.\n\nFor an exhaustive breakdown on how the trade war is affecting the computer and electronics industry, you can check out PCWorld’s own report from PC insiders or this three-hour documentary from Gamers Nexus. Host Steve Burke joined PCWorld’s The Full Nerd podcast earlier this week to chat about it."}

Too bad. Game prices have been creeping up from major publishers for the last few years, with plenty of gamers spotting a recent jump in Nintendo’s first-party prices. Microsoft’s Xbox brand is following suit, and it’s not even waiting for a new console launch to do it.\n\nAs of today, US prices of every current Xbox game console have shot up. IGN reports that the base model Xbox Series S with 512GB of storage is now $380 (up from $300), and the Series X gets a $100 bump across the board, with the top-end 2TB model going from $600 to $730. Some Xbox controllers—still the de facto standard for PC gaming—are bumping up by $10, while the much-loved Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 jumps by $10 to $20 based on what extras you get with them.\n\nAccording to the announcement page on Microsoft’s Xbox support site, “some of our new, first-party games will launch at $79.99 beginning this holiday season.” It doesn’t make a distinction between console and PC titles, which typically launch at the same time. While Microsoft didn’t explicitly spell out the Trump’s administration’s unprecedented taxes on imports from China as a reason for the hardware price increases, the fact that headset pricing increases apply only to the US and Canada would seem to point the finger at tariffs.\n\nThe aggressive price increases might seem insane considering how far Microsoft has fallen behind Nintendo and Sony in the home console space, but Microsoft is arguably in an advantageous position when it comes to rising prices for hardware and software.\n\nMicrosoft has spent years hyping up its games-as-a-service Xbox Game Pass subscription and streaming, and pushing hard on a campaign that says the screens you already own are an Xbox with no console purchase required. And that’s saying nothing of Microsoft spending a hundred billion or two on first-party publishers, like Activision-Blizzard and Minecraft maker Mojang. Microsoft has also been spreading its major published games onto the PlayStation and Switch.\n\nGame Pass, if not Xbox itself, is emerging as a more affordable option for those who want to play new games without sinking hundreds or thousands into new consoles or gaming PCs. Price increases won’t exactly help Game Pass, but it might make it look more appealing in context. But that won’t make it any easier to pony up $200 for an Xbox Elite controller, especially since more affordable options are disappearing."}

If you want HD resolution and a DVR, you’ll need to step up to the Classic tier at $7.99 per month or the Premium tier at $9.99 per month.\n\nThe differences between Classic and Premium subscriptions are that you can stream to two devices simultaneously and you’ll get three months of DVR storage with Classic, while the Premium tier gives you nine months of DVR and the ability to stream to four devices at the same time.\n\n“Frndly TV’s impressive growth and expertise in direct-to-consumer subscription services make it a compelling addition to Roku,” said Roku CEO and founder Anthony Wood in a press release. “This acquisition supports our focus on growing platform revenue and Roku-billed subscriptions, with a live content offering our users love at an industry-leading price point.”\n\nThis news story is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best live TV streaming services.\n\nRoku is paying $185 million for Frndly TV, with $75 million held back and tied to the service “meeting performance goals and milestones over the next two years.” Frndly TV CEO and co-founder Andy Karofsky and the rest of the Frndly TV team are expected to stay on after the deal closes.\n\nRoku says Frndly TV will continue to be available on the web and on streaming platforms other than Roku’s own, including Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Google TV, Apple TV, on Samsung and Vizio smart TVs, and on mobile Android and iOS devices.\n\nIn other Roku news, the company released its first-quarter 2025 earnings report today, reporting a 16-percent year-over-year increase in net revenue, but forecasting second-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates."}

Consider celebrating by reading about the origins of May Day and how workers before us fought and died for the 8-hour work week that we, the workers of today, now enjoy.\n\nIf you've been on Mastodon for long enough it's likely you've heard the phrase “you are the algorithm” in reference to the fact that Mastodon by default doesn't provide algorithmic curation of your timeline. Instead, Mastodon implements a simple linear timeline and users are expected to \"boost\" posts so they reach a wider audience, specifically their own followers. I'll be calling Mastodon's approach \"boost curation\" in this post.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm a fan of understandable systems and a critic of algorithmic curation. I do wonder if Mastodon's allergy to algorithm curation does not play well for folks who have different expectations of social media, such as wanting more \"town-square\" moments [1] where a substantial number of users are talking about one or two topics that interest them all at once.\n\nHere are some other downsides of boost curation compared to algorithmic curation:\n\nBoosts are only applied during your waking hours, meaning your followers in different timezones than you don't ever \"benefit\" from your curation.\n\nBoosts immediately put content to the top of feeds, meaning whatever you see during a given interaction with Mastodon is likely to be one or two people boosting tons of posts in succession rather than a blend of boosted posts and new posts from your followers.\n\nBoosts can mean that a post is seen more than once by a single person over the course of a day. This phenomenon might exacerbate the feeling of there being less content on Mastodon compared to other social media platforms.\n\nOnce a post is no longer being boosted it almost immediately craters because everyone's feeds move on to new content. With algorithmic curation this post would have chances for \"second-winds\" by being offered to readers outside the linear timeline.\n\nSo what can be done about the above issues while maintaining a linear algorithm-less timeline?\n\nBreaking assumptions for smarter boosts§\n\nMany other networked systems have methods for clients to \"collaborate\" and achieve a goal that helps users without actually needing to know intimate details about other implementations (which is impossible in a diverse ecosystem of clients) or to share additional information between clients. An example that comes to mind here is the different TCP congestion control algorithms which collaborate to maximize bandwidth without needing to directly share information.\n\nWhat if selecting \"boost\" in a Mastodon client didn't mean the post was reposted immediately to your followers, only that the post would be reposted eventually at the clients' discretion? To keep control in the users' hands, clients could offer an override to repost immediately, like a double-tap?\n\nWith this assumption broken, the client is now allowed to be \"smart\" by choosing the timing when the boost is applied to a post. The following simple logic could be implemented:\n\nIf the post was created recently, wait for a bit to see if the post garners any other boosts. This is done because the post is likely already at the \"top\" of relevant feeds.\n\nIf the post hadn't been boosted recently and the client hadn't boosted another post recently: boost the post. By only boosting one post at a time the client isn't clogging everyone's feeds with only boosts from a single account.\n\nIf not, delay for some amount of time and reevaluate.\n\nThe above basic routine could be refined mostly by how the \"delay\" is calculated. The delay could be a simple whole number or more complicated, like taking into account information about your followers or recent posts on the same topic. To avoid thundering herds between like-minded clients this delay could be treated almost like a \"retry\" where a random jitter is applied.\n\nAre there any Mastodon clients that already implement something similar to this that I'm not aware of? What pitfalls or other choices could a client make to make this behavior better? Send me your thoughts on this topic or Mastodon in general."}

Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., for example, has filed seven articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nAsked at the press conference about whether or not he supports that, Jeffries ducked the question and said he hadn’t spoken to Thanedar about it.\n\n“You’ll have to talk to Shri about his perspective as to what he believes to be the right thing to do at this moment. And until I have a conversation with Shri, there’s really nothing further for me to add,” Jeffries said.\n\nBut Thanedar is not the only Democrat in the House pushing for impeachment. On Thursday, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas—who was escorted out of Trump’s latest joint address to Congress in February after causing a scene—endorsed Thanedar’s articles of impeachment and previewed his own articles on the House floor.\n\n.@RepJeffries won’t tell me whether or not he’ll put his foot down on impeachment talk from @RepAlGreen and @ShriThanedar\n\n\n\nThis was the second time he was asked about impeachment (this time about Green, not Thanedar) and he gives an almost identical answer.@DailySignal pic.twitter.com/ytFznsC9u7 — George Caldwell (@GCaldwell_news) May 1, 2025\n\nAsked by The Daily Signal ahead of Green’s speech whether he plans eventually to put his foot down and make a statement on the impeachment efforts, Jeffries’ answer was almost identical to his first response, refusing to entertain the question.\n\n“I spoke yesterday for about 25 minutes to the country about my vision for the future, a blueprint for a better America, and encapsulated what I believe has occurred for America over the first 100 days [of Trump’s second term]. I was also on the steps of the Capitol for 12-and-a-half hours continuously talking to the American people … about what we believe to be important in the United States of America,” he said, adding:\n\nSo, there’s a lot of footage out there of our views on what is occurring in America and all of that information actually really does speak for itself, ‘cause it’s how we feel.\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. Pete Aguilar of California has publicly opposed impeachment articles on the grounds of the overwhelming likelihood of them failing, but Jeffries has not given a definitive answer on the matter."}

Rating: About this rating False\n\nIn April 2025, widely viewed videos claimed White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt successfully sued television talk show \"The View\" for $800 million. Variations of the claim spread on Facebook and YouTube. The videos showed images and clips of Leavitt and the hosts of \"The View\" along with a voiceover detailing what allegedly occurred.\n\nAn April 1, 2025, video from Agenda Insight had more than 166,000 views and claimed: \"The View BEGS Karoline Leavitt To STOP Her $800 MILLION Lawsuit.\"\n\nOn April 19, 2025, a different video from MagnetTV GENIUS DATA — with more than 278,000 views, as of this writing — claimed Leavitt had won the lawsuit: \"Karoline Leavitt FINALLY WINS $800M Law Suit Against 'The View'.\"\n\nHowever, both videos are fictional accounts. They originate from YouTube channels known for posting fictional stories. One of the videos has a disclaimer at the bottom of its caption. As such, we rate this claim as false.\n\nThe MagnetTV GENIUS DATA video caption stated:\n\n⚠️DISCLAIMER:\n\nOur videos are for informational and entertainment purposes only and do not claim absolute truth. All opinions expressed are those of the creators and do not necessarily reflect the views of any individuals, organizations, or media outlets mentioned. Viewer discretion is advised as the content is meant to foster open discussion, and does not endorse or promote violence.\n\nThe Agenda Insight YouTube account also shared multiple versions of the same story, including podcast host Joe Rogan's \"reaction\" to Leavitt's lawsuit. The videos do not show Leavitt, Rogan, or any of \"The View\" hosts discussing the so-called lawsuit. Instead, they take real clips out of context and edit them together with a voiceover, to suggest that these individuals are talking about a lawsuit.\n\nA simple Google search showed us there is no evidence of a lawsuit. Were this the case, it would have been widely covered by news organizations.\n\nOn April 21, 2025, fact-checking organization LeadStories also debunked a claim from one of the same YouTube channels, MagnetTV GENIUS DATA, that Whoopi Goldberg, one of the hosts of \"The View\" fled the country on account of Leavitt's lawsuit.\n\nThese videos follow a pattern carried out by YouTube channels, such as Elite Stories, that concoct elaborate fictional tales about public figures, often depicting them in a heroic or inspiring light.\n\nLeavitt and \"The View\" hosts have criticized each other in the past. In a December 2024 interview on Fox News, Leavitt said it was \"ironic\" that Goldberg, Joy Behar and other hosts spent their time calling Republicans \"conspiracy theorists\" while being \"wrong about everything they have said\" over several years.\n\nIn January 2025, Behar said on \"The View\" that Leavitt probably got her job as press secretary because Trump found her to be \"a 10\" (rating her attractiveness). In that same conversation, Goldberg criticized Leavitt for saying there would be no \"wokeness\" in the Trump administration. Goldberg said, \"Without that wokeness, you might not have that job. Because women were not invited to that table. Women were not invited to many tables in this nation.\"\n\nSnopes has debunked similar YouTube videos with fake stories about prominent individuals like tech billionaire Elon Musk and Attorney General Pam Bondi, as well as clips that used AI technology for audio or visuals. We have published a series of articles to help people identify that type of media."}

If they’re easy to remember, they’re the simplest to guess. If they’re difficult to crack, they’re the hardest to recall. Even if you use the strongest passwords possible, they’re ineffective if they become known.\n\nWhich is why I’ve stopped using them as often for account signon. But I haven’t weakened my online security by doing so. In fact, I’ve improved it—and sped up my login times, too.\n\nHow? I set up passkeys for my accounts. It takes just a few minutes, doesn’t cost anything, and can be done using your smartphone or PC. Using them is equally painless. When logging in, you choose the passkey option, then approve the login request with your thumbprint, face scan, or PIN. It’s fast.\n\nThis authentication method is secure, too. A passkey improves on several password weaknesses:\n\nThey can’t be guessed. Passkeys use an encryption method that uses two different kinds of keys as part of the verification process. The website gets the public key, while your smartphone, PC, security hardware key, or compatible password manager keeps and protects the private key. A private key can’t be determined from a public key, so a website hack won’t compromise your corresponding passkey.\n\nPasskeys use an encryption method that uses two different kinds of keys as part of the verification process. The website gets the public key, while your smartphone, PC, security hardware key, or compatible password manager keeps and protects the private key. A private key can’t be determined from a public key, so a website hack won’t compromise your corresponding passkey. Copies shouldn’t work. Passkeys are specific to the smartphone, PC, or security hardware key that created them. If a copy of the private key is somehow stolen from your device, it won’t register as valid. This is true for password managers that support passkeys, too—so long as they’re configured to verify that a passkey was used from the password manager’s platform.\n\nPasskeys are specific to the smartphone, PC, or security hardware key that created them. If a copy of the private key is somehow stolen from your device, it won’t register as valid. This is true for password managers that support passkeys, too—so long as they’re configured to verify that a passkey was used from the password manager’s platform. Phony sites can’t use them. Passkeys are tied to not just to the device that generated them, but the specific website they were created for, too. A spoofed site won’t pass the verification check. So even as phishing sites and scams get more sophisticated, you’ll be better protected against them.\n\nThe best part is the ever-widening support for passkeys. It’s not just the big names like Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. I’ve started spotting them elsewhere, like on Target.com and other shopping sites—even WhatsApp. Even sites with passkeys continue to expand their reach. In honor of World Password Day 2024, Google broadened its passkey program to include its Advanced Protection Program participants.\n\nIf you still like passwords, you don’t have to drop them entirely. Sites generally let you have multiple sign in methods. Just follow our tips for how quickly to shore up your online security—especially the part about adding two-factor authentication to your accounts. If you have a password + 2FA active, that combo can serve a backup method of login if you ever lose the device or security key with your passkeys.\n\n(That’s the only real drawback of using passkeys exclusively—you need to have multiple devices with them, in case one becomes lost, stolen, or unusable.)\n\nThe less online security interests you, the quicker you should make the move to passkeys. Most people treat passwords like the nuisance they are, reusing them or creating weak ones as often as possible. Bitwarden’s latest survey proves this point, with over 30 percent of U.S.-based respondents reusing passwords across 11 to 20+ (!) sites or apps. Yikes.\n\nWith passkeys, there’s nothing to remember. No software to manage. And again—they’re free."}

But that’s no fun. What you really need is a simple, visual way to pick a player from Roku’s lineup of a half-dozen streaming boxes and sticks (including one box that doubles as a soundbar).\n\nThat’s where my Roku decision flow chart comes in. This replaces one I made a few years ago, before Roku revamped its offerings with a couple of new cheap streaming sticks.\n\nThe flowchart (click to enlarge)\n\nJared Newman / Foundry\n\nRoku’s device lineup is more streamlined than it used to be. It no longer includes the Express or Express+, which were less portable than Roku’s streaming sticks, and all of its streaming remotes now include TV power, volume, and voice controls. (Thank goodness.)\n\nThe result is a lineup that generally provides more features with each step up the model list:\n\nThe biggest wrinkle in all of this is that you can get most of the Roku Ultra’s features by purchasing a Voice Remote Pro to use with any other Roku player. You won’t get USB media playback or Bluetooth audio, and you’ll need to use Roku’s mobile app to find the remote, but your experience will otherwise be pretty similar.\n\nBeware of old Roku players\n\nOne other caveat as you consult the flowchart: Online marketplaces such as Amazon and Walmart continue to sell discontinued Roku players, some of which have the same names as the latest models.\n\nLooking on Amazon, for instance, I see an old Roku Streaming Stick+ from 2017 (not to be confused with the new Roku Streaming Stick Plus); plus, a bunch of Roku Premiere models from 2018. These aren’t any cheaper than the latest offerings, and they’re no cheaper despite being worse in every way. Check the actual model numbers instead of just the names to make sure you’re getting the right device.\n\nOther options\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other streaming devices to consider that don’t come from Roku. Walmart’s Onn Google TV 4K Pro, for instance, costs the same $50 as a Roku Streaming Stick 4K but has better performance and a more feature-rich remote. The Apple TV 4K is pricier than any Roku player at $129, but it’s much faster and has fewer annoying home-screen ads (especially if you follow my setup instructions).\n\nBut if you’re already familiar with how Roku works and aren’t looking to change operating systems, picking the right one can be tricky. Hopefully the flowchart will make things easier.\n\nSign up for Jared’s Cord Cutter weekly newsletter to get more streaming advice every Friday"}

Over 90% of them sucked", "fullContent": "Statistically speaking, your passwords probably suck. At least, that’s the implication made by one cybersecurity research team, which analyzed over 19 billion leaked passwords and found only six percent were unique.\n\nCybernews combed through publicly available data from 200 breaches and leaks that have happened since April 2024, looking for trends and commonalities between the revealed passwords. Just over a billion were strong enough to resist dictionary attacks. The vast remainder were weak.\n\n(To put numbers on that: Almost 18,000,000,000 passwords were no good.)\n\nSo, who are the worst offenders? A few perennial members in the hall of password shame: password, admin, 123456. Cybernews says password and admin each were found 53 million times in the set, while 123456 clocked in at 338 million. Additionally, over 727 million passwords contain the sequence 1234, or almost four percent of their data set.\n\nAs for trends within the weak passwords, Cybernews found these to be common themes:\n\nNames of people (#2 most common, with eight percent chance of use in one of the passwords)\n\nWords with positive meanings\n\nPop culture references\n\nCurse words\n\nCountries\n\nCities\n\nU.S. states\n\nFood\n\nPopular brands\n\nNature\n\nAnimals\n\nSeasons\n\nMonths\n\nTop words from these topics include:\n\nlove (87 million)\n\nsun (34 million)\n\njoy (6.9 million)\n\nmario (9.6 million)\n\nthor (6.2 million)\n\nbatman (3.9 million))\n\nfuck (16 million)\n\nshit (6.5 million)\n\nbitch (3.2 million)\n\nrome (13 million)\n\nlion (9.8 million)\n\nsummer (3.8 million)\n\nmonday (0.8 million)\n\nmay (28 million)\n\napril (5.2 million)\n\ntea (36 million)\n\napple (10.7 million)\n\ngoogle (25.9 million)\n\nfacebook (18.7 million)\n\nkia (12.7 million)\n\nboss (10 million)\n\nhunter (6.6 million)\n\nsoccer (4 million)\n\nfootball (3.4 million)\n\ncarolina (1.9 million)\n\ndakota (1.2 million)\n\ntexas (1.1 million)\n\ngod (24 million)\n\nhell (20 million)\n\nIf you’re wondering what makes for a weak password, the answer is pretty simple. It’s anything easily guessed—by either humans or computers. And these days, password-cracking software has been fed dictionaries and info on widespread habits (like replacing letters with numbers or punctuation), making those apps much more efficient at their task.\n\nTwo examples of very weak passwords. Shutterstock\n\nAmong the set of unique passwords, a few commonalities emerged, too. For length, the most popular was eight to 10 characters, with 11 characters trailing in a close 4th place. Currently, eight characters is the usual required minimum. At least 12 characters is considered the baseline for better security.\n\nBesides password length, composition also made many of these unique passwords vulnerable to cracking. Almost one-third of these unique passwords (27 percent) used only lowercase letters and numbers. Another 20 percent combined mixed-case letters and digits but lacked special characters.\n\nThese formats, while better than lowercase letters alone, can still be brute-force attacked by a computer—where it keeps trying different combinations of characters to guess your password. When your password is shorter and has less variety in character types, the easier it’ll fall to this kind of cracking method.\n\nSo what’s the takeaway from these findings? Well, first and foremost, passkeys look even better against this backdrop. This newer alternate method of logging in requires no memorization, is resistant to cracking and also phishing, and requires no typing or copy/paste. If you haven’t begun using passkeys, you should. They’re a huge upgrade over passwords.\n\nCan’t use passkeys? Then you should do these four things:\n\n1. Avoid easily recognized words and phrases in your passwords.\n\n2. Use unique passwords at least 12 characters long with upper + lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Ideally, the longer the better, since computing hardware continues to get faster. The chart below gives an example of how fast AI could crack passwords in 2023—which was already two years ago.\n\nThis chart shows how the mix of numbers, letters, and symbols affects cracking time. Home Security Heroes\n\n3. Use a password manager. It’s unrealistic to memorize dozens, if not hundreds, of passwords. A password manager takes that work off your plate, and then you can make your logins much more complicated (aka stronger). The bank says you can use up to 50 characters for your password. Sure, why not?\n\n4. Enable software-based two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever you can. Ideally, use a separate app like Bitwarden Authenticator or Google Authenticator to generate your one-time codes. Text-message-based 2FA is also an option, but it isn’t as secure. If you use it, set up a PIN on your cell phone account for number porting, and secure the account with a strong password and 2FA to lessen the risk of account takeovers and SIM jacking attacks.\n\nBetter password security sounds like a drag, but it doesn’t have to be. Start with your most important accounts first, then work your way outward. Eventually, your days of “password123456” will be far behind you."}

Enter the prompt.\n\nShell the primary and foreign keys are not shown in the tables and they are mandatory\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThe generated diagram looks as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe response did improve:\n\nThe primary and foreign keys are added now. Only the foreign keys are mandatory, not the primary keys. The primary keys should have been marked as mandatory too.\n\nPrompt\n\nLet's try to fix the relations. Enter the prompt.\n\nShell Not all relations are drawn and the cardinality seems to be the other way around.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThe generated diagram looks as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dis not make any significant difference.\n\nPrompt\n\nLet's try to be more specific. Enter the prompt.\n\nShell The relations between owners and pets, and between owners and types are missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThe generated diagram looks as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe missing relations are added, but still in the wrong direction and with a slightly different syntax than in the Information Engineering Diagrams.\n\nPrompt\n\nWhich result can we achieve when using an online LLM like Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet?\n\nOpen a new chat window and enter the prompt.\n\nShell create a plantuml file from this code using Information Engineering Diagrams\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThe generated diagram looks as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis seems to be a better result, only the Information Engineering Diagrams notation is not used.\n\nPrompt\n\nIt seems that Claude 3.5 Sonnet does not know about the Information Engineering Diagram syntax. Let's give some additional instructions in the prompt.\n\nShell the IE notation is not used. The IE notation is as follows: This extension adds: Additional relations for the Information Engineering notation; An entity alias that maps to the class diagram class; An additional visibility modifier * to identify mandatory attributes. Otherwise, the syntax for drawing diagrams is the same as for class diagrams. All other features of class diagrams are also supported. Example: === @startuml ' hide the spot ' hide circle ' avoid problems with angled crows feet skinparam linetype ortho entity \"User\" as e01 { *user_id : number <<generated>> -- *name : text description : text } entity \"Card\" as e02 { *card_id : number <<generated>> sync_enabled: boolean version: number last_sync_version: number -- *user_id : number <<FK>> other_details : text } entity \"CardHistory\" as e05 { *card_history_id : number <<generated>> version : number -- *card_id : number <<FK>> other_details : text } entity \"CardsAccounts\" as e04 { *id : number <<generated>> -- card_id : number <<FK>> account_id : number <<FK>> other_details : text } entity \"Account\" as e03 { *account_id : number <<generated>> -- user_id : number <<FK>> other_details : text } entity \"Stream\" as e06 { *id : number <<generated>> version: number searchingText: string -- owner_id : number <<FK>> follower_id : number <<FK>> card_id: number <<FK>> other_details : text } e01 }|..|| e02 e01 }|..|| e03 e02 }|..|| e05 e02 }|..|| e04 e03 }|..|| e04 e02 }|..|| e06 e03 }|..|| e06 @enduml ===\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThe generated diagram looks as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe diagram is quite okay:\n\nThe hide circle should be commented out to make it more IE syntax; The relations are not correct; The instructions are followed, but even for Claude 3.5 Sonnet the relations are too complex to draw.\n\nEnd Conclusion\n\nBoth offline and online LLMs are able to generate the tables correctly. Both have problems with the relations.\n\nSome techniques for improving the response are used:\n\nPoint out the errors in the response to the LLM.\n\nUse examples.\n\nUse a different model.\n\nTry to give clearer instructions.\n\nTask: Generate PlantUML Class Diagram\n\nThe goal is to see whether AI can be helpful in generating a PlantUML Class diagram. Maybe this is easier to do for an LLM.\n\nThe Refactor code package will be used for drawing the diagram.\n\nPrompt\n\nAdd the source directory to the Prompt Context. Enter the prompt.\n\nShell Generate a plantuml class diagram for this code\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThe generated diagram looks as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe response is quite good, but also some issues exist:\n\nThe relations for the Refactor class are incomplete. Classes RefactorMessage , SingleDataDto , MultiDataDto , etc. are also used.\n\nclass are incomplete. Classes , , , etc. are also used. The double relations between BaseMessage and LocationMessage , MultiDataMessage , SingleDataMessage are not correct. This should be a single relation.\n\nand , , are not correct. This should be a single relation. Methods and class variables are correct.\n\nThe visibility of methods in class Refactor is not correct. Only the main method has public visibility and the others should be private.\n\nis not correct. Only the method has public visibility and the others should be private. DataType is an enum and should have been marked as an enum.\n\nPrompt\n\nThese issues seem to be quite similar as for the task to generate a PlantUML from SQL.\n\nWe know from Part 1 of this blog that AI coding assistants are good at reviewing code. So let's see whether the issues can be found.\n\nEnter the prompt.\n\nShell Review the plant uml and give suggestions in order to improve it. It should ressemble the provided code.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThe suggested improved version looks as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome general suggestions are given. However, the only difference with the previous version, is that the relationship between RefactorMessage and DataRepository , MessageService has a label \" uses .\"\n\nTo conclude, the classes are generated correctly besides the visibility. This saves you a lot of time already. The relations, visibility, etc. needs to be added or corrected after reviewing the PlantUML.\n\nTask: Generate OpenAPI Specification\n\nThe goal is to see whether AI can be helpful in generating an OpenAPI Specification.\n\nPrompt\n\nEnter the prompt.\n\nShell Generate an OpenAPI specification version 3.1.1. The spec should contain CRUD methods for customers. The customers have a first name and a last name. Use the Zalando restful api guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThis is quite amazing. With only very limited information, a valid OpenAPI specification is created and this really makes sense.\n\nThe list of customers should have the ID's included in the response, but this is something you can easily add yourself.\n\nTask: Generate Feature\n\nThe goal is to see whether AI can be helpful in generating a new feature.\n\nThe Spring PetClinic will be used to add a new feature. The starting point is this branch. In the Spring PetClinic, you can search for owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can search for all owners, which shows a paginated list of owners. But, you can also search for a single owner, which shows the details of that owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you would like to have similar functionality for finding pets.\n\nWith the GPU-setup, it was not possible to add the entire source directory to the prompt due to the hardware limit. Instead, this task is executed by means of Anthropic using model Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\nPrompt\n\nAdd the entire project to the Prompt Context and enter the prompt.\n\nShell create a search pet functionality, similar as searching for owners, generate the code for it\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThe suggested changes seem to be okay. They are applied in this branch.\n\nAfter applying these changes, you also need to format the files, otherwise the Spring PetClinic cannot be built.\n\nShell $ mvn spring-javaformat:apply\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when you run the application and click the \"Find Pets\" menu item, an exception occurs.\n\nPrompt\n\nCopy the exception and enter the prompt.\n\nShell the following error occurs: ``` 2025-02-01T11:31:46.013+01:00 ERROR 29216 --- [nio-8080-exec-3] org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine : [THYMELEAF][http-nio-8080-exec-3] Exception processing template \"pets/petsList\": Exception evaluating SpringEL expression: \"pet.owner.id\" (template: \"pets/petsList\" - line 22, col 10) org.thymeleaf.exceptions.TemplateProcessingException: Exception evaluating SpringEL expression: \"pet.owner.id\" (template: \"pets/petsList\" - line 22, col 10) ```\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nWhen you apply the suggested fixes and run the application, again an exception occurs.\n\nPrompt\n\nCopy the exception and enter the prompt.\n\nShell the following error occurs ``` Caused by: org.hibernate.query.sqm.UnknownPathException: Could not resolve attribute 'owner' of 'org.springframework.samples.petclinic.owner.Pet' [SELECT DISTINCT pet FROM Pet pet LEFT JOIN FETCH pet.owner WHERE LOWER(pet.name) LIKE LOWER(CONCAT('%', :name, '%'))] at org.hibernate.query.hql.internal.StandardHqlTranslator.translate(StandardHqlTranslator.java:88) ~[hibernate-core-6.6.2.Final.jar:6.6.2.Final] at org.hibernate.query.internal.QueryInterpretationCacheStandardImpl.createHqlInterpretation(QueryInterpretationCacheStandardImpl.java:145) ~[hibernate-core-6.6.2.Final.jar:6.6.2.Final] at org.hibernate.query.internal.QueryInterpretationCacheStandardImpl.resolveHqlInterpretation(QueryInterpretationCacheStandardImpl.java:132) ~[hibernate-core-6.6.2.Final.jar:6.6.2.Final] at org.hibernate.query.spi.QueryEngine.interpretHql(QueryEngine.java:54) ~[hibernate-core-6.6.2.Final.jar:6.6.2.Final] at org.hibernate.internal.AbstractSharedSessionContract.interpretHql(AbstractSharedSessionContract.java:831) ~[hibernate-core-6.6.2.Final.jar:6.6.2.Final] at org.hibernate.internal.AbstractSharedSessionContract.createQuery(AbstractSharedSessionContract.java:877) ~[hibernate-core-6.6.2.Final.jar:6.6.2.Final] ... 57 common frames omitted ```\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThe suggested changes seem to be okay. These are applied in this branch.\n\nThis time, the functionality is working as expected.\n\nA new menu item is added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find all pets, which results in a paginated list of pets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find a single pet, which returns the item in the list because there is no pet detail page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\n\nAre we able to create a new feature using AI? Well, yes, it was successful in the end, after a few iterations.\n\nWe did hit the limit of a local LLM and the hardware.\n\nTask: Generate Test Data\n\nThe goal is to see whether AI can be helpful in generating test data.\n\nThe final solution branch of the Spring PetClinic generating a feature is used.\n\nThe setup using PostgreSQL is needed. Some actions need to be taken for this.\n\nRun the PostgreSQL database. Start the following command from within the root of the repository.\n\nShell docker compose up -d\n\nCopy the contents of src/main/resources/application-postgres.properties and replace the following line in src/main/resources/application.properties :\n\nProperties files database=h2\n\nRun the Spring PetClinic.\n\nShell $ mvn spring-boot:run\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt\n\nAdd file postgres-schema.sql to the Prompt Context and enter the prompt.\n\nShell Generate test data which can be inserted by means of SQL commands in a postgres database\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nUsing a visual check, this seems to be okay. But, as they say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let's use the data.\n\nShut down the Spring PetClinic and PostgreSQL container ( docker compose down ).\n\n). Copy the suggested test data in file src/main/resources/db/postgres/data.sql\n\nStart the PostgreSQL container and Spring Boot application.\n\nThe test data is correct and complete.\n\nPrompt\n\nLet's see whether we can make the test data more specific and add some more criteria.\n\nStart a new chat window and add the file again to the Prompt Context. Enter the prompt.\n\nShell Generate test data which can be inserted by means of SQL commands in a postgres database. I want at least 5 vets, 30 owners, 10 different types of pets. Each owner must have at least one pet, some owners have more than one pet.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThis is a mediocre response and incomplete.\n\nFive vets are added.\n\nNine different types of pets are added instead of 10.\n\nOne owner is added with one pet.\n\nA second owner is added with two pets.\n\nThe pet names are not very creative (Pet1, Pet2, Pet3). Same applies to the owners.\n\nAfter this, some tests were performed using a higher temperature, but the SQL statements were not correct anymore and the data was incomplete.\n\nPrompt\n\nLet's try to split it up into smaller tasks.\n\nFirst, let's create the vets. Start a new chat window and add the file to the Prompt Context. Enter the prompt.\n\nShell Generate test data which can be inserted by means of SQL commands in a postgres database. I want at least 5 vets, exactly three specialties and every vet must have at least one specialty\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThe vets, specialties and vet specialties are created as asked. This is good.\n\nPrompt\n\nLet's create the type of pets.\n\nStart a new chat window and add the file to the Prompt Context. Enter the prompt.\n\nShell Generate test data which can be inserted by means of SQL commands in a postgres database. I want 10 different types of pets. Nothing else needs to be generated.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThis response was remarkably faster than the previous one. Ten pet types are provided.\n\nPrompt\n\nLet's create 30 owners.\n\nStart a new chat window and add the file to the Prompt Context. Enter the prompt.\n\nShell Generate test data which can be inserted by means of SQL commands in a postgres database. I want 30 owners. Nothing else needs to be generated.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nA total of 29 owners are provided, one is missing, but the data seems to be okay.\n\nPrompt\n\nLet's create at least one pet for each owner.\n\nAll data is gathered in file large-data-without-pets.sql.\n\nStart a new chat window and add the schema file and the SQL file from above to the Prompt Context. Enter the prompt.\n\nShell Generate test data which can be inserted by means of SQL commands in a postgres database. The data in large-data-without-pets.sql is already available. Generate for each owner at least one pet. Nothing else needs to be generated.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nFifty pets are created. However, owner IDs higher than 29 are used, even up to and including 50. When you omit these, or assign them to existing owners, the data is usable.\n\nFile large-data-with-pets.sql contains a fixed version where pets are assigned to existing owners.\n\nPrompt\n\nThe only thing we are missing are some visits.\n\nStart a new chat window and add the schema file and the sql file from above to the Prompt Context. Enter the prompt.\n\nShell Generate test data which can be inserted by means of SQL commands in a postgres database. The data in large-data-with-pets.sql is already available. Generate 20 visits. Nothing else needs to be generated.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nThe response can be viewed here.\n\nResponse Analysis\n\nThe LLM created 20 visits for the first 20 pets. It is not very creative because it just took the first 20 pets, but it did what was asked.\n\nThe data is gathered in file large-data-with-visits.sql. Copy and paste it in the data.sql file of the Spring PetClinic. Start the database container and the Spring PetClinic application. All data is available for use.\n\nGenerating test data with an LLM can save you a lot of time. Depending on the capabilities of your LLM, it is wise to split it into smaller tasks for better results.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the examples used in this blog, the following conclusions can be drawn:"}

As he begins his New York state retrial for a series of rape and sexual assault charges over a period of years, that consensus has broken.\n\nTo see just how wide of a cultural swing we’re in the midst of, observe the questions right-wing commentator Candace Owens and manosphere hero Joe Rogan — notable “just asking questions” provocateurs — have begun asking on Weinstein’s behalf.\n\n“After looking over this case, I’ve concluded that Harvey Weinstein was wrongfully convicted and basically just hung on the Me Too thing,” Owens said on a podcast on Sunday. Owens is in the midst of promoting “Harvey Speaks,” a series of jailhouse interviews with Weinstein which she promises will exonerate him.\n\n“I can’t believe I’m on Harvey Weinstein’s side,” Joe Rogan said on his podcast in March. “I thought he was guilty of, like, heinous crimes and then you listen, and you’re like, ‘Wait, what? What is going on?’” Rogan says Owens’s series convinced him to change his mind on Weinstein.\n\nThis high-profile support for Weinstein is part of a larger anti-Me Too, anti-feminist backlash that took off in earnest in 2023, arguably beginning with the Amber Heard-Johnny Depp domestic violence trial. The days in which America was transfixed by accusation after accusation of sexual violence committed by famous men are long over. Gone is the era in which it seemed possible that America was going to truly hold sexual predators accountable, regardless of their fame and power. In this moment, America is more often transfixed by the idea that those famous men aren’t so bad after all — that maybe the women who accused them are simply lying.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nFor Owens and Rogan to embrace even Harvey Weinstein signals a true sea change in the place the Me Too movement holds in American culture, and with it, a change in how we understand sexual violence. In the first days after Weinstein was accused, around 2017 and 2018, he was treated as a sort of boogeyman, a man whose crimes were so many and so monstrous that all the other sexual crimes coming to light around the same time paled in comparison.\n\nNow, Weinstein himself is apparently no Weinstein.\n\n“He’s no Weinstein,” commenters said of all the other accused men in those months: Louis C.K., Al Franken, Garrison Keillor. Over the next few years, as Weinstein faced jail time and the other men by and large did not, Weinstein became, as the feminist commenter Jessica Valenti wrote in 2022, a point of comparison next to which everyone else seemed not particularly bad. “Weinstein went to jail,” Valenti wrote, “so that when a woman complains about Louis CK winning a Grammy, men can scoff at her greedy overreach.”\n\nNow, Weinstein himself is apparently no Weinstein.\n\nWeinstein is currently facing retrial in New York because his 2020 guilty verdict was thrown out on a procedural issue. He is still serving out a 16-year sentence he received after a 2022 guilty verdict in Los Angeles, but a not guilty verdict in the New York retrial would mean he would not have to serve any time on top of that LA sentence. As he waits for the current trial to make its way through the courts, he appears optimistic about Owens’s efforts on his behalf. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” he told the New York Post. “The woman is going to be a superstar, and I have been around stars.”\n\nOne of the greatest successes of the Me Too movement at the height of its influence was not necessarily the criminal prosecution of accused sexual abusers, but its powerful challenge of myths around sexual abuse that had been pervasive for decades. To see Owens’s millions of podcast subscribers and social media followers respond by and large favorably to these familiar flimsy defenses shows just how much we seem to have regressed.\n\nOne of the greatest successes of the Me Too movement was not necessarily the criminal prosecution of accused sexual abusers, but its powerful challenge of myths around sexual abuse.\n\nFirst, Owens incorrectly asserts that of the more than 80 women who accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, only three ended up bringing charges against him. This, she says, proves that the rest of Weinstein’s accusers were liars, and that the evidence against him is thin. In fact, three women brought charges against Weinstein in New York and five more in Los Angeles. By most standards, being legally charged with sexual assault against eight different women would be considered a lot, although in Weinstein’s case, it does work out to around 10 percent of his public accusers.\n\nSexual assault is notoriously difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the standard of defense in a criminal court. Many of the women who accused Weinstein publicly did so years or even decades after the fact, a common phenomenon among survivors of sexual assault, both because of the shame associated with the attack and the difficulty of securing a conviction. In some cases, the legal statute of limitations had closed by the time these survivors finally went public.\n\nThe standard of evidence in a criminal court is high for good reason: if you’re going to take someone’s freedom away from them, you should be absolutely certain that they committed a crime. The eight cases brought against Weinstein represent the eight cases that law enforcement was confident they could prove to that standard.\n\nThe fact that the other 72 or so accusations against Weinstein never resulted in criminal charges doesn’t mean that they’re all false. It doesn’t mean that they’re all true, either. It means they don’t meet the high standards of a courtroom, and that’s it.\n\nOwens’s second major argument is that Weinstein’s accusers continued to spend time with him and, in some cases, send him flirtatious messages after they say he attacked them. She contends that they were acting as “sugar babies,” engaging in a quid pro quo relationship with Weinstein in which they traded sexual favors for his professional support.\n\nIt is true that many of the women who have accused Weinstein of sexual assault continued to maintain friendly relationships after their attacks. This, too, is extremely common among victims of sexual violence, the vast majority of whom know their attackers well. In the case of Weinstein and his accusers, Weinstein held significant professional power over his alleged victims — and his reputation as a vindictive actor left little doubt that he would not hesitate to use it. He torpedoed the careers of women who rejected his advances. That includes Mira Sorvino, who said she was forced to stop acting in major studio films after she turned him down (director Peter Jackson confirmed he decided not to hire her after Weinstein advised him against it).\n\nWe also know that Weinstein’s machinations didn’t stop with professional retaliation. As publication approached for the two bombshell news articles breaking the story of Weinstein’s decades-long pattern of sexual assault, Weinstein hired private security agencies, including former Mossad spies, to collect compromising information on the women who were preparing to accuse them.\n\nNone of the information or context I am laying out here is new. All of these revelations were discussed in the press in great detail in the weeks and months after the Weinstein story first broke in October 2017, and then repeated again over the course of his 2020 New York trial and his 2022 Los Angeles trial.\n\nWhen Owens performs her “just asking questions” routine about Weinstein, she is not asking new questions.\n\nThat was one of the few benefits of using Harvey Weinstein as a symbol of the worst kind of monster a sexual predator could possibly be. It was reductive and a little sensationalist, but at the very least, the public’s fascination with Weinstein meant a chance to talk through a few all-too pervasive rape myths. It meant a chance to explain why so many women hesitate to come forward and tell their stories, why so many women maintain relationships with their attackers, and why it’s so hard to get a conviction on a rape case. For a time, it looked as though if the Me Too movement had accomplished anything outside of a few high-profile arrests, it was at least that it educated the public."}

These 9 free apps make it feel like Windows 10 again", "fullContent": "Just a few months before the end of free support, Windows 10 is still the most widely used operating system version from Microsoft: Almost half of all Windows PCs are still running it.\n\nWhile you can count businesses among the crowd that might be loathe to change, the fact is that many consumers are just very satisfied with Windows 10 and they aren’t in any hurry to adopt a new way of doing things with Windows 11. There is still no “killer application” that would make the case for switching from Windows 10 to 11.\n\nOn the contrary, Microsoft recently cancelled one of the most important new feature of Windows 11, namely support for Android apps on PCs.\n\nStill, once Windows 10 hits end of service, it will become increasingly risky for users to stick with the OS, beloved as it might be.\n\nFurther reading: Windows 10 will hit end of life in 2025. Here’s what to expect\n\nThe good news is that there are myriad ways to mimic the Windows 10 experience on Windows 11. Here are 9 free apps that prove that point.\n\nWindows 11 Pro\n\nTry out Windows 11\n\nYou can only really judge what Windows 11 has in store for you and how you will cope with it once you have it and use it. If you are currently still working with Windows 10 and your computer fulfils the system requirements for Windows 11, you can simply switch to the new version via the Windows update.\n\nMicrosoft will even create a temporary backup copy that you can use to return to your Windows 10 with all settings, data, and programs for 10 days. After these one and a half weeks, the “Windows.old” backup folder on the system partition is automatically deleted.\n\nHowever, experience shows that the “Revert” function does not always work reliably. To try out Windows 11 without any worries, we recommend backing up the entire system partition.\n\nWindows 11 like Windows 10\n\nIn practice, however, the main thing is to adapt the existing system with Windows 11 to the familiar Windows 10 in terms of operation, functions, and appearance.\n\nIn addition to the “Windows 10 style”, the Start11 software provides other ready-made profiles that make your own system look like an earlier version of Windows. Foundry\n\nStart11 customizes your system to the style of either Windows 7 or 10 with just a few mouse clicks. This applies in particular to the classic Start menu and the functions of the earlier versions, which Microsoft has now cancelled.\n\nAfter installation, select the style option for Windows 7 or 10 in the program, then click on “Start icon” in the section bar on the left and switch off the central positioning in the taskbar.\n\nThen search the internet for the desktop background of the previous system in the native resolution of your monitor using the keyword “Windows 10 wallpaper,” save the image file to your hard drive, and insert it as the background. This is done quickly, and Start11 also offers many other settings to customize your PC.\n\nStartallback is free and also easy to use; here you can choose between three styles for Windows 7, 10, and 11. Regardless of this decision, the layout of the taskbar and Windows Explorer can be defined and many other things can be changed.\n\nAnother free tool for customizing is Open Shell Menu. The Explorer Patcher, which you can access via “Properties (Explorer Patcher)” in the Start menu, is also useful.\n\nExplorer Patcher customizes Windows Explorer, the taskbar, and more in a variety of ways.

According to an insightful report by Lewis Steele of The Daily Mail, the Reds are prioritising two key areas: striker and left-back.\n\nThis isn’t just idle speculation. “Liverpool want a striker – that is 100 per cent certain,” Steele writes. The club have struggled to find consistent goal-scoring form this season, and all signs suggest that this is the summer where that issue will be aggressively addressed.\n\nNeed for a Ruthless No. 9\n\nDarwin Nunez’s future at Anfield looks increasingly uncertain after what has been described as “three up and down seasons.” Despite flashes of promise, his inconsistency in front of goal has left many frustrated. Diogo Jota, though a quality finisher when fit, has battled persistent injuries. And while Luis Diaz has stepped in as a false nine at times, his natural home remains on the wing.\n\nAs Steele rightly notes, “It is obvious why they want one – Darwin Nunez has not been good enough, Diogo Jota has struggled for form and fitness, while Luis Diaz is better as a left winger despite his best efforts as a No 9.”\n\nIn that context, Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike has emerged as “one to watch.” Though there are no guarantees yet, Liverpool’s scouting department appears to be tracking the French striker with serious interest. Steele adds that while names like Victor Osimhen have been floated, “I have not heard anything on that one yet,” suggesting the club may opt for a more cost-effective or versatile option.\n\nLeft-Back for the Future\n\nAndy Robertson remains a trusted servant of the club, but at 31 years old and with his contract due to expire next year, Liverpool are sensibly planning for succession.\n\n“Milos Kerkez could be joining this summer as Liverpool’s new left back,” Steele reports, referencing the Hungary international who has impressed at Bournemouth. The Reds’ interest in Kerkez was “first trailed… way back in November” by Mail Sport, and their pursuit continues.\n\nAjax’s Jorrel Hato has also been discussed, although Steele notes that “talk about him has cooled somewhat recently.” Virgil van Dijk, however, is reported to be “a big fan,” so it’s possible that discussions may be revived later in the window.\n\nDependence on Player Exits\n\nWhile the intent to strengthen is clear, Liverpool’s level of activity will hinge on outgoings. “A lot is dependent on who leaves,” Steele says, highlighting the club’s need to “balance the books.” This suggests that we may see a domino effect — where departures could free up funds for deeper reinforcements, including a central defender, midfielder or wide attacker.\n\nIt’s a smart approach, one that reflects the club’s more measured financial strategy under new leadership.\n\nSlot’s Philosophy Demands Evolution\n\nArne Slot has spoken openly about Liverpool’s need to start dominating games more comprehensively. According to the report, “the manager has discussed many times how Liverpool have not blown teams away – a lot of the wins have been by narrow scorelines – and often compared this to Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City who… used to win by bigger margins.”\n\nIt’s a subtle yet powerful insight. Liverpool under Klopp were known for intensity and comebacks; Slot appears to favour control and authority from start to finish — which explains the need for more cutting edge in the final third and dependable defenders to underpin transitions.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs Liverpool fans, this update feels like the beginning of an exciting new chapter. Arne Slot is clearly not here to coast on Klopp’s legacy — he’s already pushing to evolve the team and correct longstanding issues. We’ve all felt that sense of “what if” this past season — what if we had a proper No. 9? What if we weren’t relying on an ageing fullback to bomb up and down the pitch every week?\n\nSeeing Hugo Ekitike linked brings back that thrill of unearthing raw, dynamic talent. He’s got pace, power and that swagger you want in a young striker — and if Slot can mould him, we could have a serious weapon on our hands. Milos Kerkez is another clever shout. Young, energetic, Premier League-tested — it’s the kind of signing that doesn’t break the bank but raises the ceiling.\n\nThis isn’t just about patching holes. It’s about setting up the next five years. And if we get the striker and left-back sorted early, we might finally see Liverpool dominating games in the Slot era, not just edging them.\n\nSummer can’t come soon enough.\n\nYNWA."}

Shri Thanedar (D-MI) over his “idiotic” bid to impeach President Donald Trump, calling it nothing more than a “despicable” attempt to play to the “far-left radical crowd.”\n\nThanedar introduced seven articles of impeachment against Trump on Monday, accusing the president of “sweeping abuse of power” and “acts of tyranny” that threaten the rule of law. But support among Democrats has been minimal. Though Trump was twice impeached while in office, he was acquitted both times by the Senate, where Republican backing shielded him.\n\nResponding to Thanedar’s new effort at a rally Tuesday, Trump dismissed it with mockery: “Today they did it again. Some guy I’ve never heard of…is he a congressman? He says, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to start the impeachment of Donald Trump.’ What the hell did I do? Here we go again.”\n\nThe line was repeated during a Piers Morgan Uncensored clash on Wednesday night as Piers Morgan platformed Thanedar to allow him to make his case, only for his co-panelist Lake and MAGA podcaster Tim Pool to push back.\n\nAfter Pool ripped the Democrat for introducing the impeachment bill to raise his political profile, Morgan asked Thanedar: “Alright, Congressman, you’re just doing this because you’re a narcissist, basically?”\n\nThe Democrat pointed to Trump’s low 100-day approval ratings in polls released last week as a sign of “buyer’s remorse” among his voters before Lake began her takedown.\n\nIn a barrage, Lake accused the congressman of trying to win the “good graces” of the “AOC crowd” and said the impeachment move proved Democrats “don’t know what to do”:\n\nFirst of all, where did this guy come from? With all due respect, this is an idiotic thing to do. And it’s proving that the Democrat Party has no play. They don’t know what to do right now because Trump is winning on everything. He’s strategizing how to fix the economy that Joe Biden drove not only into a ditch, but off a cliff. And this is why the American people were suffering. And it sounds to me like this is a political move to try to put [Thanedar] in good graces with the AOC crowd and the very, very far left radical crowd ahead of another election. This is ridiculous. The American people were sick of the previous attempts of impeaching President Trump before. They don’t wanna see this again. And I’m embarrassed for this gentleman. I’m embarrassed for that congressman that he’s doing that, that he has fallen to that level to try and impeach President Trump. In his first 100 days as he tries to save us from the serious missteps of Joe Biden and that administration that almost broke the backs of every American in this country. What about the fentanyl that’s no longer pouring across the border? What about lives that are saved there? What about a president who’s trying to end a war that’s killing thousands, tens of thousands of people and costing all kinds of our treasure over in Ukraine? What about that? No, he’s trying to concentrate on something to make people all of a sudden know who he is so that he can raise money and run for reelection. I find it despicable. I really do.\n\nSomewhat stunned, the Democratic congressman argued that Trump had failed on the economy, offended allies through trade policies, and been unable to deliver on his promise to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. Specifically, he pointed to his own state of Michigan and argued that Trump’s policies were “hurting” the auto industry.\n\n“Is this a congressman out of Michigan? Is that what I’m hearing?” Lake followed.\n\n“Yes,” Morgan responded.\n\n“And you’re not for President Trump? You’re for the tariffs that are going to single-handedly save the American auto industry?” she jabbed. “Good luck. Good luck getting re-elected.”\n\n“Look, our car prices are going to go up, domestic cars are going to be more expensive, foreign cars are gonna be more expensive. People won’t be able to afford to buy a car,” Thanedar offered in return.\n\nWatch above via YouTube."}

Liverpool’s Striker Plans Assessed on Daily Red Podcast", "fullContent": "Liverpool’s Striker Search: Why Gyökeres Leads the Pack\n\nIn the latest Daily Red Podcast, Dave Hendrick gave listeners a clear and passionate rundown on Liverpool’s potential striker moves this summer. With the Reds crowned Premier League champions, all attention now turns to how Arne Slot can elevate his squad. One area of focus? The attack. Hendrick left no doubt: “This is not the end of something, this is the beginning of something really special under this manager.”\n\nGyökeres Doing It at Every Level\n\nThe standout name in Hendrick’s discussion was Viktor Gyökeres, the Sporting CP forward enjoying a sensational run in Portugal. Hendrick was unequivocal in his praise: “This guy is absolutely outrageous. You do not do what he’s doing without being a special footballer.”\n\nGyökeres has netted 38 league goals, a figure that dwarfs rivals: “Pavlidis has 18 league goals this season, Samu has 16… Gyökeres has 38. You can add together any two players in the league and he’s scored at least four more than them.”\n\nThe former Coventry man has proven his worth in both the Championship and Liga Portugal. Hendrick highlighted his consistency and versatility: “He’s done it in English football in a tough league. He’s gone to Portugal and it’s not just that he’s shone — he looks so far and above everyone else in that league, it’s like he’s playing a different sport.”\n\nValue Over Hype\n\nCritically, Hendrick pushed back against lazy comparisons: “It needs to stop with the Darwin comparisons because Darwin never did this. His season last year was significantly better than the Darwin season that we bought Darwin off the back of.”\n\nWhile some fans may question Gyökeres’ age — he turns 27 this summer — Hendrick dismissed that concern: “If you want a win-now move, a ready-made goal scorer, he is right there… I think he’s 20 goals a season in the Premier League for four, five, six years.”\n\nStriker Targets: Osimhen, Alvarez, Samu, Pavlidis\n\nHendrick mentioned other elite targets: Victor Osimhen, Julian Alvarez, and Alexander Isak. But price tags and availability make them unlikely: “Newcastle have no real intention of selling Isak… If they’re in the Champions League and he’s got three years left on his deal, why would they sell?”\n\nAlvarez, though ideal stylistically, is also seen as unrealistic. Hendrick noted: *“He would be incredible… but he’s not gettable.” That’s why Gyökeres makes the most sense — productive, available and proven: “Sporting are open to selling for below his release clause according to all reporting.”\n\nAs for others like Samu and Pavlidis, Hendrick was respectful but firm in his rankings: “People have talked about Samu, and I think he’s a really big prospect… Pavlidis at Benfica has been mentioned… but Gyokeres has 38 goals.”\n\nReady for the Next Evolution\n\nLiverpool’s next chapter under Arne Slot could be defined by how smartly they move in the striker market. Hendrick closed the striker talk by saying: “If we can’t get Isak or Alvarez, Amoura and Gyökeres are right there. Both of them are gettable… Gyökeres could do similar for us as Ruud van Nistelrooy did for United.”\n\nThat’s high praise, and a bold prediction. But Hendrick’s case is clear: if Liverpool want immediate output, European experience and physical presence, Gyökeres might just be the answer."}

The 20-year-old centre back has quietly emerged as one of the Premier League’s most promising talents after his move from Juventus, and according to Lewis Steele of the Daily Mail, Liverpool are “definitely one of the clubs keen on signing him this summer.”\n\nThe Reds are far from alone in their pursuit. Steele reports that Chelsea, Arsenal, and Newcastle are also circling, creating a four-horse race for Huijsen’s signature. With a reported £50 million release clause, the Dutch-born defender won’t come cheap, but his ceiling appears well worth the investment.\n\nSteele adds that “super agent Ali Barat will play a role in that move after brokering Huijsen’s switch from Juventus to Bournemouth last summer,” alongside Huijsen’s father Don, who is also acting as a representative for his son.\n\nEuropean Ambitions Delay Talks – For Now\n\nDespite Liverpool’s interest, formal negotiations are reportedly on pause. Bournemouth remain firmly in the mix for European qualification, and out of respect for their ambitions, Liverpool “will certainly not be advancing any deals with Bournemouth – Huijsen, Kerkez or Antoine Semenyo – while the Cherries are still in the mix,” according to the article.\n\nThis is a tactical move from the Reds, reflective of the respectful but highly strategic nature of the club’s operations. However, Liverpool know time is not on their side. Chelsea, who are set to participate in the FIFA Club World Cup, are expected to act early in the market – a factor that could force Liverpool’s hand immediately after the season ends.\n\nWhy Huijsen Fits the New Liverpool Model\n\nThere is a growing sense that younger, technically proficient players will be at the heart of the Arne Slot’s squad rebuild. Huijsen fits that profile perfectly.\n\nOnly 20 years old, he already carries a blend of European pedigree and Premier League experience. His composure in possession, aerial presence, and eye for reading the game make him a standout candidate for Liverpool’s high-intensity system. In a post-Virgil van Dijk world, Huijsen could be moulded into a long-term anchor in the backline.\n\nThe atmosphere at Anfield is also being viewed as a decisive factor. As Steele eloquently notes: “those scenes at Anfield on Sunday will certainly play a role in transfer targets’ minds this summer – they must have watched on and think they want to join the fun at Liverpool.”\n\nCompetition Will Be Fierce – But So Will Liverpool’s Resolve\n\nThough the competition is intense, Liverpool’s recruitment structure has long been adept at securing its primary targets. From Mohamed Salah to Luis Díaz, and most recently Dominik Szoboszlai, Liverpool have a track record of identifying top talent and acting decisively – often ahead of wealthier clubs.\n\nThere’s also a tactical draw to consider. Under Slot, defenders who are comfortable with the ball and able to initiate attacks will be prized – and Huijsen is exactly that. While Chelsea and Arsenal might boast bigger budgets, Liverpool can offer something harder to define: a project that blends history, opportunity, and momentum.\n\n“Huijsen is one of the most interesting defenders in the Premier League right now,” a source close to the situation reportedly told the Mail. “There’s no doubt several clubs are watching.”\n\nAs things stand, Liverpool fans may need to be patient until Bournemouth’s season concludes, but the signs suggest a flurry of activity could follow. With Ali Barat in the background and multiple Premier League clubs in the hunt, the coming weeks could be pivotal.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool fans, this latest link to Dean Huijsen is both thrilling and timely. With Ibou Konate still yet to sign a new contract, the need for reinforcements at centre-back is obvious. What makes Huijsen so intriguing is not just his technical ability but his maturity – he plays like someone five years older.\n\nUnder Arne Slot, a progressive style of play will likely place more emphasis on building from the back, with defenders expected to step into midfield or start transitions. Huijsen ticks every box. At £50 million, he’s not cheap, but he might just be the type of investment Liverpool need to compete long-term with the likes of City and Arsenal.\n\nWhile Chelsea can offer more money and Arsenal boast Champions League football, Liverpool offer something unique: a world-class development environment, passionate fans, and the opportunity to be central to a new era.\n\nThere’s also a sense that the player would suit Liverpool’s culture – hard-working, intelligent, and quietly ambitious. If Huijsen is as smart as he looks on the pitch, he may just choose the red side of Merseyside. This one could be the signing that defines Slot’s first summer."}

Here's the full history", "fullContent": "The history of organized labor is long and brutal. The history of May Day, the holiday honoring the organized labor movement (it's also called International Workers' Day), was likewise born out of blood.\n\nOlder generations might connect May Day with the Soviet Union, with military parades and with communism, while younger generations may have not heard of the holiday at all. But, May Day was not created by the Soviet Union, for the Soviet Union or in the Soviet Union. May 1, International Workers' Day, was made in America.\n\nThe American labor movement in 2025 is a shadow of what it once was. It's certainly still capable of powerful things — take the 2023 Screen Actors Guild strike that shut down much of Hollywood for about six months.\n\nBut it pales in comparison to the heydays of the movement, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when workers across the United States frequently used massive strikes to bargain with their employers for better pay, safer workplaces and other unfair labor practices.\n\nEstablishing a 10-hour workday\n\nOne such movement throughout the time period was the fight for an eight-hour workday. According to the Economic History Association, many American workers labored for \"seventy hours or more per week,\" from \"first light to dark\" during the 1700s and early 1800s. Assuming one day off, that's more than 11 hours each day.\n\nAcross the 1800s, however, employees began to organize and fight to reduce the working hours. According to a 1932 pamphlet published by the communist Alexander Trachtenberg, some of the earliest trade unions, formed in the 1820s and 1830s, went on strike specifically to demand a 10-hour workday. Following the economic downturn in the Panic of 1837, U.S. President Martin Van Buren signed an executive order establishing a 10-hour workday for federal workers.\n\nThe next goal was making that 10-hour day universal, which was accomplished bit by bit in the years leading up to the Civil War. The workers pushed on. \"No sooner had this demand been secured in a number of industries than the workers began to raise the slogan for an 8-hour day,\" Trachtenberg wrote. He noted a case in Australia where workers successfully demanded \"eight hours work, eight hours recreation and eight hours rest\" in 1856.\n\nWhile the Civil War temporarily slowed organized labor, the movement gained momentum in the following years. In 1866, a group of union leaders founded the National Labor Union in Baltimore, with an explicit goal of establishing an eight-hour workday. While the organization folded less than a decade later, its campaign lived on.\n\nBy the 1880s, conflicts between striking workers and the government had intensified. For instance, the federal government and state governments sent militias and the National Guard to break up a massive strike of railroad workers in 1877. At least 100 workers died in the violence, according to Britannica.\n\nGeneral strike on May 1, 1866\n\nIn 1884, a group of labor unions created a collective organization that would eventually evolve to become the American Federation of Labor (the AFL in today's AFL-CIO). At its fourth meeting, according to Trachtenberg, the group passed a resolution declaring \"that eight hours shall constitute legal day's labor from May First, 1886.\" While the group did not declare how it intended to establish the eight-hour day, the subtext was obvious.\n\nOn May 1, 1886, tens of thousands of workers across the country walked off their jobs sites in a large general strike. The New York Times reported demonstrations in St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston and elsewhere.\n\nChicago, in particular, was a hotbed of labor organizing, and the city was on edge. On May 3, in an effort to protect strikebreakers and intimidate striking workers, police shot and killed a striker at the McCormick Reaper Works.\n\nA group of anarchists announced a demonstration in Haymarket Square, located around Des Plaines and Randolph Street, the following day. The mayor of Chicago, Carter Harrison, said he would attend.\n\nOn May 4, 1886, toward the end of the rally, as the crowd was beginning to disperse, an unidentified person threw a stick of dynamite into the police ranks, killing seven. The police opened fire on the crowd in response. Four attendees died, and several more were wounded in the aftermath.\n\nEight prominent anarchists were arrested and put on trial for murder. Despite evidence showing that some of the men arrested were not even present, all eight were convicted and sentenced to death. Four were hanged and a fifth died of suicide.\n\nThe events at Haymarket Square provided the push for an eight-hour workday with international attention. In the coming years, the American Federation of Labor continued to advocate for the practice in the United States, and chose to continue striking on May 1. The Second International, a gathering of labor organizers and socialist parties across the world, chose May 1 as a strike day out of solidarity with the Americans.\n\nLabor Day made a national holiday\n\nToday, however, America celebrates Labor Day instead of May Day. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the two holidays had similar intentions — a holiday for workers. However, one was accompanied by direct action and associated with dynamite being thrown at a crowd. The other was associated with street parades and festivals. In 1894 (in the wake of another strike that President Grover Cleveland broke using the Army), Congress passed a bill establishing Labor Day, not May Day, as a national holiday. Cleveland signed the bill.\n\nIt took a while for workers to finally win out. The eight-hour workday was effectively made law by the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandated a 40-hour work week with overtime pay, still the standard in the U.S. to this day.\n\nExcept for possibly the cobblestones of the nearby alley, Haymarket Square no longer truly exists — it's now a parking lot and modern-looking private residences. The city of Chicago erected a memorial on the site in 2004."}

Thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI), this vision is becoming a reality. In 2025 and beyond, AI is reshaping education, making learning more personal, flexible, and effective than ever before.\n\nStudents today expect personalization in all aspects of life, from movie recommendations to online shopping, and education is no exception. AI offers a way to meet these expectations, helping learners stay engaged, motivated, and confident in their abilities. As we continue to embrace technology in classrooms and corporate training programs, understanding how AI supports personalized learning is crucial for shaping the future of education. This article explores how AI is transforming personalized learning, the technologies driving it, the benefits and challenges involved, and what the future might hold.\n\nWhat Is Personalized Learning?\n\nPersonalized learning means tailoring education to meet each student's unique needs, strengths, and interests. Instead of offering the same lessons to every learner, educators now aim to adjust teaching methods, pacing, and content to fit individual students. With technology evolving so quickly, students today expect education to feel just as customized as their favorite apps or streaming services.\n\nHow AI Supports Personalized Learning\n\nAdaptive Learning Systems\n\nAI-powered adaptive systems adjust lessons based on how students perform. If a learner struggles with a topic, the system provides additional support or practice. Platforms like Duolingo and Coursera already use adaptive learning to help students stay motivated and succeed.\n\nIntelligent Tutoring Systems\n\nAI tutoring systems act like virtual personal tutors. They observe how students work, offer hints, correct mistakes, and recommend new tasks—all in real time. These tools create a dynamic environment where support is always available, helping learners build confidence and skills independently.\n\nPredictive Learning Paths\n\nBy analyzing a student's past activities, AI can predict where they might face challenges. It can recommend personalized next steps, helping students move forward efficiently without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nAI-Powered Mind Mapping Tools\n\nMind mapping is a visual technique that helps organize and connect ideas. Today, AI-powered mind mapping tools take learning a step further by automatically converting content from textbooks, articles, notes, or even full PDFs into clear mind maps. These tools help learners see the big picture, spot gaps in knowledge, and create customized study plans. Visual learning like this supports better memory, deeper understanding, and a more engaging learning experience.\n\nKey AI Technologies Behind Personalized Learning\n\nMachine Learning\n\nMachine Learning allows AI systems to \"learn\" from student data and improve recommendations over time. The more students interact, the more accurate and helpful the AI becomes.\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nNLP enables AI to understand human language, powering chatbots, writing assistants, and virtual tutors. This technology makes it easier for students to ask questions, receive feedback, and practice communication skills instantly.\n\nRecommender Systems\n\nSimilar to Netflix suggesting shows, AI in education suggests courses, activities, or materials based on a student's interests, behavior, and needs. This keeps learning relevant and exciting.\n\nBenefits Of AI-Powered Personalized Learning\n\nGreater engagement\n\nLessons adapt to student interests, boosting motivation and focus. Improved retention\n\nPersonalized paths and visual tools like mind maps make it easier to understand and remember concepts. Time efficiency\n\nTeachers save time on routine tasks, and students learn more efficiently. Support for diverse learning styles\n\nWhether visual, auditory, or hands-on learners, AI can cater to many learning preferences.\n\nChallenges To Consider\n\nData Privacy And Security\n\nPersonalized learning relies heavily on data. Schools and developers must prioritize keeping students' personal information safe and secure.\n\nBias In AI Systems\n\nAI can sometimes reinforce existing biases if it learns from biased data. Ongoing evaluation is necessary to ensure that recommendations are fair and inclusive.\n\nMaintaining The Human Connection\n\nWhile AI offers many advantages, it cannot replace the emotional support, creativity, and mentorship provided by human teachers. Striking the right balance between technology and human interaction remains crucial.\n\nLooking Ahead: The Future Of Personalized Learning\n\nThe future of AI in education looks promising.

That compared to a net loss of 19 cents in the year-ago period. Consensus estimates ranged from breakeven to a 10-cent loss for the recent period.\n\nGains on the sale of rolling stock were a 2-cent tailwind (at a normalized tax rate) compared to last year.\n\nRevenue fell 19% year over year to $219 million. (Heartland does not provide operating metrics for utilization and pricing.)\n\n“Our consolidated operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2025, reflect a combination of adverse weather experienced in January and February, tariff uncertainties amongst our customers in March, along with prolonged industry-wide challenges where operating cost inflation continued to outpace customer freight demand and freight rate improvements,” CEO Mike Gerdin stated in a Wednesday news release.\n\nTable: Heartland’s key performance indicators\n\nHeartland (NASDAQ: HTLD) reported a 107.1% adjusted operating ratio, which was 150 bps worse y/y. It said its legacy Heartland Express fleet was profitable in the quarter and “continued to operate in line with the best full truckload carriers in our industry.”\n\nHowever, its other three brands – Millis Transfer, Smith Transport and Contract Freighters Inc. – lost money in the period.

Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nTired of dipping test strips into your pool water or dribbling chemicals into beakers to figure out if you have a pH problem? Good news: You’ve got plenty of options when it comes to automating the pool chemistry monitoring process.\n\nNew to the mix is the Crystal Smart Water Monitor, from a company called General Galactic Systems, whose CEO previously founded another smart pool monitor product called pHin.\n\nThe Crystal Smart Water Monitor takes readings every 10 minutes, 144 times a day, so you are always getting a close-to-real-time look at your pool conditions.\n\nSpecifications\n\nCrystal uses both a similar sensor technology and features a similar subscription-based business model as pHin, but its overall design and approach to testing is quite different. Functionally, it combines the near-real-time results and self-contained operation of the previously reviewed ioPool with the deck-based mounting of the Water Guru Sense, which we’ve also reviewed. I’ve been testing it for more than a month as swim season creeps up on us to see how it compares to the competition (we’ve also previously reviewed the Sutro).\n\nThe Crystal Water Monitor wouldn’t be so visually intrusive if the probe that goes into the pool was the same color as the body. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nThe Crystal Smart Water Monitor hardware is unique in that the brains of the operation—a disc-like device powered by three AA batteries—sits on your pool deck, or somewhere thereabouts. While the WaterGuru Sense hardware also needs to stay dry and is mounted in the lid of your pool skimmer, Crystal leaves it up to you to find a convenient place to locate the device. It can be strapped to a handrail or mounted to the deck itself with either screws or tape; either way the primary drawback of the Crystal quickly becomes apparent: It’s not easy to find a place to put the device where it’s both secure and out of the way.\n\nThis is especially problematic if, like me, your pool has no handrails above the waterline. Once the hub is placed, a probe attached to a lengthy black cord dangles from the hub and into the pool.\n\nPerformance\n\nI initially had the hub attached to the deck, but this never felt overly secure to me, and I was constantly worrying the tape would come loose and it would get kicked into the water. The company later suggested a better idea, which it said other customers have used: Place the hub on top of the skimmer, and run the probe wire through one of the access holes in the lid, out the skimmer entrance, and then into the pool.\n\nThis arrangement avoids taking chemical measurements from the water in the skimmer, which the company says might not be representative of the pool at large. You can see how this installation looks in the photo below.\n\nOne location the manufacturer suggests installing the Crystal Water Monitor hub is on top of a skimmer lid, with the device’s probe snaking through the lid and then out the skimmer entrance into the pool. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nThe Crystal Smart Water Monitor takes readings every 10 minutes, 144 times a day, so you are always getting a close-to-real-time look at your pool conditions. Measurements include temperature, pH, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), which is the same “total disinfection power” measurement that ioPool uses in lieu of measuring free chlorine. Measurements of cyanuric acid and water hardness are also stored in the app, but these are drawn from test strips that you are prompted to periodically dip into the pool and use for calibration. Ten strips are included in the box.\n\nThe Crystal mobile app sets up easily and—mercifully—does not require a separate bridge plugged into a nearby outdoor outlet to connect to your 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network. The app is a bit odd in that a primary screen indicates only the water temperature and a color-coded indication of overall conditions. Blue is good, orange or red mean at least one reading is off. From there you can drill down to see chemical conditions, but by default pH and ORP are reported only in a graphical history chart that you’ll need to scroll down to see.\n\nThe Crystal Water Monitor app offers suggestions for placing the monitor along with readings from the device itself, including pH level, oxidation-reduction potential, water temperature, and more. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nThe top of the page instead shows information from your test strip-driven water report, and it doesn’t change unless you dip a new one. The “…” menu to the side of this water report section takes you to yet another page where pH, ORP, and water temperature are outlined in finer detail.\n\nThe bottom line is that all the information about your pool is there, but the app doesn’t really prioritize what most pool owners will want to see first. Eventually I found a buried menu item that at least lets you add pH and ORP to the top of the second page, but I still wasn’t in love with the layout. If numbers are off, the system allows you to set what brand of chemicals you use so you can get a personalized recommendation about how much of any given product you should use to correct a problematic condition.\n\nOne issue I encountered is that Crystal consistently reports rather high pH numbers for my pool in comparison to test strips of various manufacture. Shortly after original calibration, in fact, a test strip read a pH of 7.2 but the app suggested a sky-high pH of 8.6. That reading has come down over time, but Crystal’s readings are still steadily coming in at 0.4 above what test strips suggest.\n\nMeasurements of cyanuric acid and water hardness are also stored in the app, but these are drawn from test strips that you are prompted to periodically dip into the pool. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nThat said, I have no way of knowing exactly which of these is correct. ORP is harder to judge since test strips only measure free chlorine, but here Crystal’s numbers seem a bit overly optimistic about conditions. I’ve come to expect a limit to the accuracy of sensors like these, but my hope had been that repeated calibration with test strips would bring things a little closer into alignment. Still, as a broad look at pool conditions, things are at least close enough to be useful.\n\nOne thing I didn’t love was that the Crystal app encouraged me to shock the pool every week, which is something I’ve never done and something no pool maintenance pro I spoke to said they’d ever done either, citing it as overkill that would leave the pool with too many chemicals in it on a regular basis.\n\nThe Crystal Water Monitor’s sensor probe inside the pool. Christopher Null/Foundry\n\nA Crystal rep admitted that there were two schools of thought on this front—shock weekly, or only shock when conditions are getting particularly dire—but noted that many best practices still recommend a weekly shock. (My research indicates that is indeed the case.) There’s no way to tell Crystal what your preference is, but the weekly suggestion to shock is at least easy to snooze or dismiss entirely.\n\nUp-front and ongoing costs\n\nThe Crystal Smart Water Monitor is sold on a subscription basis. $449 gets you the hardware and your first year of support. If you have a saltwater pool, the upfront price is $479. Both cost an additional $99 per year after the first year. That fee includes replacement probes when needed (every couple of years), support, and any other hardware replacements you might need, which is pretty much anything apart from fresh AA batteries for the hub. Those should last about a year. Crystal techies can even look up your pool condition history if you need advice on how to solve a particular chemical problem.\n\nThe calculus on whether this is cheaper than ioPool (roughly $329 every other year), WaterGuru ($300, plus about $25 per month), or Sutro ($499, plus $29 per month) quickly gets complex. But even though its up-front cost is high, Crystal does arguably have the cheapest option on the market—depending on how long your ioPool lasts. (Mine died after two years.)\n\nSadly, Crystal also has the least attractive monitoring solution on the market, and it’s not even close. The hub isn’t bad, but the black probe snaking into the pool is a real eyesore that is impossible to hide against a white pool wall. Crystal could have gone a long way toward fixing this by making the probe and connecting wire white instead of black; but for now, no color options are offered.\n\nDon’t miss TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best robotic pool cleaners.\n\nShould you buy a Crystal Water Monitor?\n\nThe look of the Crystal Water Monitor alone is enough to make me question how long I’ll keep it in the pool. That said, I’ll likely keep it installed through the summer to monitor how it fares over the long term as the weather gets (very) hot.\n\nThose with dark surfaces in their pools might find this product less visually intrusive."}

They’re reusing them, relying on easily cracked ones, or are unaware of current recommended guidelines. Their reasons for not using a password manager are usually understandable, too. But they’re still wrong.\n\nPasswords are similar to the locks on the front door of a house. And when you live in a city (the internet is definitely that crowded), everyone throws on at least one lock. But choose the doorknob’s lock, and it takes but a minute for an experienced burglar to get past it. You want a deadbolt at a minimum, and in higher traffic or rougher neighborhoods, you might have a thicker door (or even an iron gate before your door), sturdier hinges, and longer screws for your deadbolt strike plate.\n\nAnd yet, you don’t have to rely solely on keys to deal with your door locks. These days you can tailor your safety setup to make life easier and still more secure—e.g., using PIN pads, Bluetooth readers, and other methods to gain entry.\n\nPassword managers are the same. You can choose one that works for you, whatever your needs or concerns—you don’t need to rearrange your life for it. Don’t believe me? Watch as I dismantle the top six reasons people don’t use a password manager lickety-split.\n\nAlready using a password manager? Here are 10 ways to make the most of it.\n\nReason 1: I have my own system and it works fine\n\nYour passwords are hopefully not this weak, but a homebrew system still can’t beat out a password manager. Shutterstock\n\nA lot of folks still believe using numbers and symbols in place of letters or riffing off of a base password is sufficient protection. The sad news is that those strategies aren’t strong enough anymore and haven’t been for a while. My colleague Mark Hachman explains how easy it can be to crack a password—and extrapolate patterns and habits to make cracking future passwords even easier. In other words, it’s becoming easier and easier to pick the lock on a digital door.\n\nYou can gamble on never getting hit with an account takeover attempt, but you’re going to lose that bet sooner rather than later. Data breaches are only increasing in frequency (and scope), with potential fallout also increasing as vital services move further online. And even if you are generating your own long passphrases or even randomized passwords, keeping track of them will either be less protected than in a password manager (a spreadsheet with an innocuous name isn’t secure, alas) or slip your memory at some point.\n\nReason 2: It takes too much time\n\nYou can set up a password manager to automatically fill in your login info, as well as generate and save passwords. It’s much faster than manual input. (Shown here: iCloud Keychain on an iPhone.) PCWorld\n\nNot true! Typing out your login info takes longer than having your password manager pop up and autofill the credentials for you. So while it may seem like it’s slowing down your process to use one, it’s not.\n\nAs for setting up the password manager—some require no work to make them part of your routine. The ones built into Google, Apple, and Microsoft’s ecosystems (heck, even into browsers like Firefox) tie in with your existing account and offer automated password management across devices.\n\nEven third-party password managers are pretty seamless if you can spare a few minutes to sign up and then install a browser extension and mobile app. You might have to also tweak a system setting or two to ensure full integration into your flow, but it’s fast if you do. Once that’s complete, the experience is nearly as effortless as with first-party password managers—and you get more robust features.\n\nOh, and entering all your passwords into the manager doesn’t have to happen all at once, either. It’s ideal, but if you take care of the sensitive accounts (and upgrade the quality of your passwords for them too!), you can then gradually add more credentials as you log into those accounts.\n\nReason 3: It costs too much\n\nBitwarden, our top pick for free password managers, offers a ton of features. You don’t have to spend any money in order to have good security. PCWorld\n\nYou don’t have to spend a single cent for a good password manager.\n\nOUr favorite paid password manager Dashlane Read our review Best Prices Today:\n\nYes, paid password managers do often get recommended, but that’s because of their extra useful features—not their level of protection. A paid service will offer a wider range of two-factor authentication options (like hardware authentication keys or the ability in the password manager to generate software-based tokens), easier password sharing, family plans with group access to passwords, special travel-oriented features, and more. For not much cash, you get a tangible quality of life improvement.\n\nBut a good free password manager will store all of your login info securely and also easily generate long, random passwords for every website and app. And just like paid password managers, it will also recognize sites you visit and offer to automatically fill in your credentials, as well as support basic two-factor authentication.\n\nThe better free services also provide a way to share passwords securely, set an emergency access for trusted contacts, and can generate unique user names (not just passwords), email masks, and more.\n\nReason 4: Having all my passwords in one place is dangerous\n\nYou can use an app like Authy or Aegis to generate two-factor authentication tokens. PCWorld\n\nI hear you on this one. The idea that you would put all of your passwords in one place can seem like a direct contradiction with security. If someone breaks in, you could be in for a world of pain.\n\nBut you can mitigate this concern with little difficulty. Your first line of defense: Choose a good master password and enable two-factor authentication. This is arguably the most important thing you can do to safeguard yourself. You can (and should) also protect your accounts by requiring a PIN, biometric authentication, or your master password for all installed browser extensions and apps.\n\nHow you choose to store your passwords can minimize or eliminate this issue, too. For example, you can lean on KeePass as your manager, which gives you complete control over the file holding all your login info. Save it on a trusted PC or external drive (don’t forget to back it up!) and access to your passwords will remain limited.\n\nKeePass might not look like much, but it gets the job done while giving you complete control over your password database. You can also opt for one of its forks, like KeePassXC, for a more modern interface. PCWorld\n\nOr you can spread your passwords between different services and apps. Maybe you sign up for both Dashlane and Bitwarden, storing a mix of accounts in each. Alternatively, you could put your info for less valuable accounts in a cloud-based manager, while your high-value account info stays locked up tight in a KeePass file. Another riff on this idea: Split passwords themselves into different fragments and store them across different accounts. For all of these scenarios, you can have both browser extensions or apps installed on your devices for simultaneous use.\n\nThese options are a little more complicated, but you’ll still be remembering no more than a couple of mega-strong passwords. And you’ll have a faster and stronger system than typing out passwords kept in your brain.\n\nReason 5: Storing my passwords in the cloud seems risky\n\nYou can approximate a DIY cloud-based password system if you choose KeePass and store its database with a cloud provider you trust. Or just keep the file offline for complete control—the choice is yours. Microsoft\n\nThis is a fair concern. Even the most diligent company could have a vulnerability in their system. Bugs are an unfortunate but regular part of software development.\n\nBut you still have options. As mentioned earlier, KeePass saves passwords to a local file, which lets you keep that data out of cloud-based storage. Or you can DIY your own cloud solution by uploading a KeePass vault file to a cloud storage provider you trust (one that has enough engineers to properly ward off hackers and have proper safeguards against rogue employees)—e.g., Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud Drive, or Google Drive.\n\nYou can go with a hybrid system instead as well. Use an online password manager for medium- and lower-value accounts (places that have your address and billing info, but not more), while financial and other highly personal accounts are stored in a more tightly controlled environment. If you’ve been OK with using Ilovetarget.com as your password for shopping online at Target, this solution surely can’t be that objectionable.\n\nReason 6: I’ll get stuck with a password manager I hate\n\nNope, you can move at will. A standard practice for all reputable password managers is the ability to export your passwords. The better services allow you to export as an encrypted file, which minimizes the risk of sensitive data falling into the wrong hands. By the way, always choose the encrypted option, because a plain-text file of all your passwords is no bueno.\n\n(This one’s easy to lay to rest!)\n\nGood password managers will let you export your passwords in an encrypted format for easy and safe transfers. (Shown here: Bitwarden’s browser extension.) PCWorld\n\nAny (reputable) password manager is better than none\n\nThis won’t be the last time I write about password managers, much less try to convince people to use them.\n\nBut let me say, whenever you hear different arguments from tech journalists (even right here among the PCWorld staff!) about why paid password managers are better, or that browser-based password managers should be passed over—don’t let that confuse you. Or turn that into a reason to write off online security as too complicated.\n\nThe reputable password manager that you use is the best one. Simple as that. I just want you all to be safe. Having to frantically recover an account or deal with identity theft is no one’s idea of a good time."}

We’re all for ditching weak passwords — especially when strengthening your security takes only a little effort.\n\nFollow these four easy suggestions and you’ll thank yourself for years to come. Not only will data breaches and hackers stop being immediate threats, but you won’t have to scramble to remember a collection of user name and passwords. That’s especially true if you opt for a newer form of account protection that’s simpler to use than passwords.\n\nTrust us, you want to safeguard yourself. Data breaches are common these days, and as Bitwarden’s 2024 survey results indicate, a concerning number of people still reuse passwords (31 percent in the U.S. do so for 11 to 20+ sites!). A lot of people also use very weak PIN codes, too. With so many data leaks, hackers can more easily figure out bad passwords and the personal info you might use in a password — another common bad habit (42 percent in the U.S.). Yikes.\n\nGet a password manager\n\nThe best password manager Dashlane Read our review Best Prices Today:\n\nPassword managers make better account security so easy. You only have to memorize one strong password to safeguard nearly all your other login info. (Here’s how to come up with a good master password.)\n\nYou shouldn’t have an issue finding a password manager that suits you, either — it’s perfectly normal to have reservations about them, but there are so many options out there. Want something that integrates seamlessly with your phone or browser? Google, Apple, and Firefox’s password managers are basic but solid. Hate the idea of all your passwords sitting in the cloud? Try KeePass or one of its variants. Need support for advanced two-factor authentication methods, like a YubiKey? Many paid services include it. Password managers now also generally support passkeys, a simpler yet more secure method of account protection.\n\nPaying for a good solution isn’t always necessary either, as you’ll see when going over our lists of the best paid password managers and the best free password managers. The kinds of features that unlock when paying for services are helpful indeed, especially if you’re using multiple devices or want to secure passwords for multiple people, but they’re not absolutely vital otherwise. That said, our go-to solution — Dashlane — makes managing passwords dead simple and only costs $33 per year, or $2.75 per month. It’s money well spent for the added security (and the extra polish).\n\nAnd don’t worry if you try one service and don’t like it. Exporting and importing password databases is simple.\n\nUse strong, unique passwords for everything\n\nCompanies like Terahash can combine several hundred GPUs to crack short passwords instantly. This chart shows how longer passwords can make the process impossibly long, even with such computing power on hand. Terahash / Twitter\n\nEven websites that barely register in your memory deserve a strong, unique password. If you’ve left behind traces of personal information — or financial information, like stored credit card info — unauthorized access to your account could lead to future headaches.\n\nNormally, remembering a strong, random, and unique password for every place you visit on the internet would be a pain in the rear. Everything requires a login these days. But with a password manager (which of course you’ve just set up!), you no longer have that responsibility. So long as you have the browser extension (or app installed on your phone), you can let it choose a password for you. Just tell it how many characters in length and what mix of them. (Security experts currently recommend 24 characters in length, randomly generated with numbers, letters, and special characters; you can also opt for a similarly long passphrase for things you need to manually type.) The fun part is that because you don’t have to memorize each password yourself, long and complex strings aren’t a hassle.\n\nIf you want to really level up your login security, you can also use strong, unique user names, too. With a password manager tracking everything, being randominternetuser13960 on one site, ithurtstomove4582 on another, and pizzacoma2259 on a third is a cinch. Have to use an email address for your login? Gmail and some other email providers let you create aliases by adding a plus sign (+) and phrase after your account name. So for example, you could use emailaddress+likesbooks@gmail.com to distinguish that particular site. Or better yet, you can wholesale upgrade to email masks for true anonymity.\n\nEnable two-factor authentication, too\n\nTwo-factor authentication adds a second layer of security while logging in. Apple\n\nWe hate to say it, but these days, strong passwords alone aren’t enough to ward off threats. Data breaches happen, and so do moments of being caught off-guard by phishing attempts.\n\nTwo-factor authentication adds another layer to your login process. Instead of having immediate access to your account upon entering your user name and password, you’ll have to pass another security check before access is granted. (You can read more about how 2FA works in our explainer, which also gives more details on the common forms available.)\n\nLike using a password manager, two-factor authentication doesn’t have to be a cumbersome addition to your login process. Apps like Authy, Aegis, and Ravio make accessing your 2FA codes on multiple devices simple, and support easy security measures like biometric authentication to protect those codes from prying eyes.\n\nWe of course recommend enabling two-factor authentication on as many accounts as possible, but at minimum, do it for major accounts like email and financial services — places with info that could wreak havoc on your life if someone else got unauthorized access. Also consider protecting your Amazon, social media, Steam, and work accounts (and their info ripe for use in social engineering) in this way, too.\n\nFor sites that don’t have two-factor authentication — which sadly includes a large number of e-commerce sites — you can help limit damage from unauthorized account access by not leaving your credit card information and address on file.\n\nUse a passkey\n\nMost people will probably use a phone for their passkey storage, but they work with Windows PCs, Apple hardware, and security keys, too. Google\n\nThis newer form of account authentication has been spreading steadily since last year, and just in time, too. Passkeys cut out a lot of the hassle of using passwords while also providing strong security out the gate — a quality of life upgrade sorely needed as online security gets more complex.\n\nYou just need a device like a phone, tablet, or even your PC to serve as an authenticator. It’ll be registered to your account when you generate the passkey. Afterward, you’ll get prompts on the device to authorize logins, which you’ll approve using face identification, a fingerprint, or a PIN. It’s incredibly simple, and more importantly, passkeys are more resistant to the current effects of data breaches. Because they are an asymmetrical form of encryption, a hacker can’t guess at your passkey based on the compromised website’s encrypted login data. Only you have the other part of the puzzle, and it’s a different kind of piece than the part saved to your website account.\n\nYou can also use a password manager to store passkeys, though they’re currently a bit less secure than using a physical device.\n\nYou can read more about passkeys in our coverage of Google’s launch of passkey support for its accounts (as well as in Google’s own excellent overview of the topic), but basically, this is the cutting-edge of online security.

With Trent Alexander-Arnold ‘still expected’ to join Real Madrid this summer, what comes next?\n\nBradley’s Potential and Limitations\n\nConor Bradley has impressed since emerging into the Liverpool first-team picture, but there are understandable concerns over whether the young Northern Irishman can shoulder the full burden of the right-back role, should Trent depart. As Lewis Steele of The Daily Mail noted, “Conor Bradley is a fabulous footballer but he cannot play every week.” This isn’t a critique of Bradley’s quality, but rather a recognition of his injury record and ongoing development.\n\nSince being promoted last season, Bradley has dealt with “a few niggly injuries,” and as physically demanding as the right-back position is within Liverpool’s high-intensity system, depth is essential. Arne Slot will want to ensure that a balance is struck between promoting youth and maintaining consistency.\n\nFrimpong an Option, But Not a Priority\n\nBayer Leverkusen’s Jeremie Frimpong is one of the most exciting wing-backs in Europe and has been linked repeatedly with a move to Anfield. Steele reports that “Confidential understands the Bayer Leverkusen wing back will be on the move” and adds that “he has signed a mega-money boot deal ahead of a big transfer.” Despite this, Steele is also clear that “Liverpool are not in active discussions to sign him at this stage.”\n\nThat phrasing matters. While Frimpong may be on the market, Liverpool appear to be prioritising other areas, particularly left-back. This will undoubtedly raise eyebrows among fans, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding Alexander-Arnold and the physical question marks hanging over Bradley.\n\nOla Aina: A Smart Short-Term Fix?\n\nOne intriguing possibility comes in the form of Nottingham Forest’s Ola Aina. Set to become a free agent this summer, the Nigerian international could provide an experienced, athletic option without breaking the bank. “If he was available on a free transfer then, after the season he has had, big clubs should definitely be keeping tabs,” Steele writes—and it’s hard to disagree.\n\nAina has enjoyed a quietly consistent campaign in a struggling Forest side, and his tactical versatility would appeal to a manager like Arne Slot, who values adaptable players in transitional phases.\n\nStrategic Priorities and Squad Depth\n\nIt’s notable that despite all the speculation around Frimpong and others, “the noises are that the left back position is seen as a bigger priority.” This suggests Liverpool’s internal assessment has highlighted issues on the opposite flank—potentially linked to Andy Robertson’s long-term fitness or the limitations of Kostas Tsimikas.\n\nStill, ignoring the right-back spot would be a gamble. Alexander-Arnold’s departure would leave a creative vacuum and a structural hole that Bradley, no matter how talented, may not yet be ready to fill alone.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a Liverpool fan’s perspective, this report feels both clarifying and frustrating. The idea that the club is not currently pursuing Frimpong—a top-tier attacking right-back—while Trent’s future remains unresolved, will concern many. Jeremie Frimpong is not just a replacement; he’s a statement. If he’s available, and Liverpool aren’t at least in talks, then one must ask: is the club underestimating the potential gap Trent would leave?\n\nConor Bradley deserves every bit of praise, and he has shown tremendous promise. But fans also remember how quickly early fitness concerns can become long-term worries. Relying on him as the sole option without a solid Plan B feels risky, especially with a new manager bedding in.\n\nThe idea of Ola Aina on a free is an intriguing one—smart, low-risk business. But can he deliver consistently at a Champions League-challenging level? That’s the question supporters will ask. It feels like a short-term fix for what could be a long-term void.\n\nUltimately, if Liverpool are willing to cash in on one of their most unique talents in Alexander-Arnold, then they must replace him with someone equally capable of impacting games—not just plugging holes."}

According to Lewis Steele of the Daily Mail, the 20-year-old Spaniard is now getting “rave reviews in Spain from people who watch him every week for Las Palmas.”\n\nThat shift in fortunes has not gone unnoticed. Local journalist Manuel Garcia shared glowing praise last month: “He reminds me of Sergio Busquets, because of how he drives the ball and how he moves around the field.” For any young midfielder, such comparisons are significant. For Liverpool fans, they could prove mouth-watering.\n\nArne Slot’s Long-Term Thinking\n\nFollowing Jurgen Klopp’s departure, new manager Arne Slot has brought renewed energy and a tactical evolution that’s already borne fruit — with a sensational Premier League title secured in his first season. As part of his long-term squad planning, Slot had a clear vision for Bajcetic: loan him out, get him consistent game time, and assess his readiness for first-team involvement.\n\nSteele reports: “Arne Slot was keen for him to get this year of experience under his belt and did plan for him to be part of the squad in the future if the season out on loan was a success.” While the season has been something of a mixed bag, the final stretch in Spain could tilt the balance in the youngster’s favour.\n\nPre-Season Pivotal to Bajcetic’s Liverpool Future\n\nWhile it’s premature to declare the loan a triumph or failure, Bajcetic’s recent performances have likely bought him a chance to stake his claim in pre-season. Slot’s interest remains intact, and “as far as I am aware Bajcetic will be given a chance to prove himself on the pre-season tour,” according to the Mail’s piece.\n\nThat tour is expected to be a high-stakes proving ground and it’s a huge opportunity for the youngster. Liverpool’s midfield has evolved under Slot with greater technical fluidity and pressing coordination. Bajcetic, once considered a key future figure under Klopp, now has the task of convincing a new regime of his value. Steele rightly notes: “He is definitely not earmarked for a sale yet.”\n\nNot Just Potential – Real Progress\n\nWhile fans might focus on standout youth academy graduates like Conor Bradley and Jarell Quansah, Bajcetic’s technical ceiling remains high. He has shown elite composure in tight spaces, positional discipline, and a mature sense of timing in his passing — all traits that bode well for a squad challenging on multiple fronts next season.\n\nSlot’s midfield options are already well-stacked, but with European ambitions and domestic silverware on the agenda, a player like Bajcetic could be vital in maintaining squad depth without sacrificing quality.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nStefan Bajcetic could be one of the most exciting reintegrations into the Liverpool squad this summer. It’s no surprise that Las Palmas fans and Spanish pundits are drawing comparisons to Busquets — you can see it in the way he reads the game and dictates tempo. That’s not something you teach; it’s instinctive, and Bajcetic has it in spades.\n\nWith Arne Slot already delivering the title in his debut campaign, the atmosphere around the club is electric. Fans are dreaming again, and rightly so. Bringing Bajcetic back into the fold could feel like a new signing. He’s still only 20, and yet has tasted football in Austria and Spain — those experiences, while not always smooth, will have hardened him mentally.\n\nLet’s not forget how good he looked when he broke through under Klopp before injuries hampered his progress. If he can stay fit and Slot gives him a platform, this could be a breakout year for him. And with a more possession-heavy system now in place, there’s arguably no better time for a Busquets-style midfielder to thrive.\n\nImagine a midfield trio of Bajcetic, Mac Allister and Szoboszlai rotating fluidly, with Bajcetic anchoring play. That’s not just depth — it’s a frighteningly intelligent midfield core.\n\nThe fans will back him. And if his recent form is anything to go by, the coaches will too. This pre-season might just be the beginning of something special for a young man who looks born to wear the Liverpool shirt."}

Meanwhile, widespread optimism in the broader tech sector, highlighted by strong earnings from major tech giants like Microsoft and Meta, certainly supported the surge in Oracle's share price.

This development aligns with Oracle's wider strategy of expanding its cloud power capacity and multi-cloud partnerships with giants like AWS, Google, and Azure. Such initiatives are anticipated to accelerate future revenue growth, especially in AI training and database migration, thus boosting Oracle's earnings forecasts. Analysts predict substantial growth in Oracle's revenue and earnings due to these efforts, with strong performance obligations reflected in a US$130 billion increase.\n\nOver the past five years, Oracle's total shareholder return, including share price gains and dividends, was 192.19%.

Despite the substantial return, the recent price surge has yet to align fully with the consensus price target of US$178.12.

Shri Thanedar to his face Wednesday on British journalist Piers Morgan’s show over his push to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nThanedar, elected to Congress in 2023, introduced articles of impeachment Monday against Trump, accusing the president of abusing executive and trade powers and defying Congress by allegedly removing its power of the purse. While debating his stance on “Piers Morgan Uncensored,” Lake called out the Democrat representative, saying his party’s fixation on Trump proves they have “no play.”\n\n“First of all, where did this guy come from? With all due respect, this is an idiotic thing to do. It’s proving that the Democrat Party has no play. They don’t know what to do right now because Trump is winning on everything,” Lake said. “He’s strategizing how to fix the economy that Joe Biden drove not only into a ditch but off a cliff. This is why the American people were suffering.”\n\n“It sounds to me like this is a political move to try to put him in good graces with the AOC crowd and the very, very far left radical crowd ahead of another election,” Lake added. “This is ridiculous. The American people were sick of the previous attempts of impeaching President Trump before. They don’t want to see this again.”\n\nDemocrats have ramped up their pushback of Trump since March, focusing on the administration’s efforts to shut down the southern border and conduct mass deportations of illegal migrants. Thanedar, in his impeachment push, cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s April 10 ruling, which ordered the administration to aid in facilitating the return of illegal migrant Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia from El Salvador’s mega-prison after his March deportation. (RELATED: ABC News’ Terry Moran Challenges Trump To ‘Pick’ Up Phone And Order Alleged Gangbanger Returned)\n\nWATCH:\n\n\n\nLake went on to say she felt embarrassed for Thanedar.\n\n“I’m embarrassed for this gentleman. I’m embarrassed for that congressman that he’s doing that, that he’s fallen to that level to try to impeach President Trump in his first 100 days as he tries to save us from the serious missteps of Joe Biden and that administration that almost broke the backs of every American in this country,” Lake said.\n\n“What about the fentanyl that’s no longer pouring across the border? What about the lives that are saved there? What about a president who’s trying to end a war that’s killing thousands, tens of thousands of people and costing all kinds of our treasure over in Ukraine? What about that?” Lake asked. “No. He’s trying to concentrate on something to make people all of a sudden know who he is so that he can raise money and run for reelection. I find it despicable.”\n\nDuring the four-year Biden-Harris administration, an estimated 11 million border encounters took place, with daily averages peaking at 15,000. Officials like former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre attempted to blame congressional Republicans. Voters quickly made the crisis a top concern heading into November.\n\nAccording to a White House 100-day fact sheet shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation, Trump’s second administration has seen daily border encounters drop by 93% and migrant crossings fall by 99.99%.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The challenge of creating cohesive visuals across multiple scenes has long been a stumbling block for artists and creators using AI tools. From fluctuating facial features to mismatched environments, maintaining continuity often feels like an uphill battle. But now, with the introduction of Runway Gen-4 References, the game is changing. This innovative AI video generation tool doesn’t just generate visuals—it enables creators to produce seamlessly consistent characters and environments, all while offering unprecedented creative control. Whether you’re crafting a short film or designing a vibrant digital world, this technology promises to transform how we approach AI-driven storytelling.\n\nAt the heart of Gen-4 References lies its ability to integrate reference images into the creative process, allowing you to guide the AI with precision and clarity. Imagine uploading a portrait to ensure your protagonist’s expressions, clothing, and even lighting remain consistent across every scene.

This feature doesn’t just streamline workflows—it opens up new realms of possibility for filmmakers, designers, and content creators alike. As we explore the capabilities of this new tool, you’ll discover how it’s redefining the boundaries of AI-generated visuals and why it’s poised to become an essential resource for modern creators.\n\nRunway Gen-4 References Overview\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Gen-4 References integrates reference images to enhance the quality and accuracy of AI-generated visuals, allowing creators to guide the AI with up to three images for precise character, environment, and detail replication.\n\nThe tool ensures consistency across multiple outputs, preserving key visual elements like character traits and environments, making it ideal for storytelling and complex projects.\n\nCustomizable prompts enable creators to explore diverse creative directions, specifying details such as poses, lighting, and emotional tones for tailored outputs.\n\nIt supports refining and combining visual elements, allowing iterative improvements and the merging of multiple references to create cohesive and intricate compositions.\n\nFuture updates aim to expand capabilities to include objects, styles, and other elements, while fostering a supportive community and offering resources to maximize creative potential.\n\nIncorporating Reference Images for Enhanced Creativity\n\nThe core strength of Gen-4 References lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate reference images into the creative workflow. You can upload up to three reference images to guide the AI in generating characters, environments, or other visual elements. These references can include specific details such as lighting, color palettes, poses, or compositions. For instance, if you are designing a character, you can use a portrait to ensure the AI replicates distinct facial features, expressions, or even clothing styles. This feature offers you greater control over the output, allowing you to translate your creative vision into reality with precision and ease. By using this functionality, you can achieve a level of detail and accuracy that enhances the overall quality of your projects.\n\nMaintaining Consistency Across Visual Outputs\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in AI-generated visuals is making sure consistency across multiple outputs, especially when working on complex projects. Gen-4 References addresses this issue by allowing you to preserve key details such as character traits, hairstyles, clothing, and architectural or environmental elements. By tagging or naming your references, you can easily reuse them in future projects, making sure continuity and coherence. For example, if you are creating a video series featuring the same protagonist, the tool ensures that the character remains visually consistent across different scenes. This capability is particularly valuable for storytelling, as it enhances the viewer’s experience by maintaining a seamless visual narrative.\n\nRunway Gen-4 References AI Video Demo\n\nExpanding Creative Possibilities with Customizable Prompts\n\nGen-4 References supports detailed and conversational prompts, giving you the ability to explore a wide range of creative directions. You can instruct the AI to generate specific poses, lighting conditions, or even the emotional tone of a scene. This level of customization allows you to experiment with various styles and scenarios while maintaining control over the final output. For example, you might ask the AI to create a character in a dynamic action pose or generate a tranquil, sunset-lit landscape. The tool’s ability to adapt to your instructions ensures that the final visuals align perfectly with your creative vision, offering both flexibility and precision.\n\nRefining and Combining Visual Elements\n\nAnother standout feature of Gen-4 References is its capability to refine and combine images. You can reuse generated visuals as references, allowing iterative improvements and adjustments to achieve the desired outcome. Additionally, the tool allows you to merge multiple reference images to create cohesive and complex compositions. This is particularly useful for projects that require blending elements from different sources. For instance, you can combine a character reference with a specific background to craft a unified scene where all elements align seamlessly. This functionality not only enhances creative possibilities but also simplifies the process of creating intricate visuals.\n\nStay informed about the latest in AI video generator by exploring our other resources and articles.\n\nFuture Enhancements and Expanded Capabilities\n\nWhile Gen-4 References currently focuses on characters and locations, future updates aim to broaden its scope to include objects, styles, and other visual elements.

Rating: About this rating Mixture What's True Although the original image held by Trump in the photo was genuine, it had been edited to insert the text \"MS-13\" above the symbols tattooed on Abrego Garcia's hand. What's False There is no clear evidence proving a link between Abrego Garcia's hand tattoos and MS-13.\n\nDuring an April 29, 2025, interview with ABC News, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly referenced a rumor that Kilmar Abrego Garcia — a Maryland man who immigrated to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador in 2012 and was deported in March 2025 — had the gang name \"MS-13\" tattooed on his knuckles, even after journalist Terry Moran told him those letters had been edited onto a photograph of Abrego Garcia's left hand (at timestamp 22:00 in the video below).\n\nTrump first shared the supposed proof of Abrego Garcia's gang membership in a photo posted on X and Truth Social on April 18, 2025. In the photo, Trump is holding a piece of paper featuring a separate picture purportedly showing the tattoos across Abrego Garcia's hand.\n\n(X user @realDonaldTrump)\n\nOther users shared a cropped version of the photograph showing a close-up of the tattoos:\n\n(X user @WesternDecline_)\n\nSnopes readers searched the site and wrote to us asking whether the photograph was real and if it proved Abrego Garcia was affiliated with MS-13. While publicly available evidence confirmed the image shared by Trump was authentic in origin, it also confirmed the image had been altered to insert the text \"MS-13\" above the actual tattoos — in effect annotating them. There was no clear evidence the symbols on Abrego Garcia's fingers proved an affiliation with MS-13.\n\nAbrego Garcia was mistakenly detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on March 12, 2025. According to CASA, an immigration advocacy organization involved in Abrego Garcia's legal defense, he had no criminal convictions in either the U.S. or El Salvador. In 2019, a judge ordered that he not be returned to El Salvador on the grounds that he would face persecution. Three days after his detainment in 2025, however, the government sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center prison, or CECOT, without a hearing, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe Trump administration itself called his detention and removal an \"administrative error.\"\n\nEven after acknowledging it had made a mistake, however, the administration repeatedly claimed that it ordered Abrego Garcia be sent to the Salvadoran megaprison because he was a member of MS-13. (Snopes previously investigated the little evidence the administration has used to justify Abrego Garcia's gang affiliation and concluded there was not sufficient evidence to prove he was in the gang.) Trump shared the photograph as supposed proof of such a connection, and the post's caption claimed Abrego Garcia had \"MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles.\"\n\nOther photos of Abrego Garcia provided confirmation that he has four knuckle tattoos, as shown in the picture held by Trump. Trump's picture had been edited to add the text \"MS-13\" above the tattoos, but there was no actual evidence demonstrating a link between the tattoos and the El Salvadoran gang.\n\nTrump's photo of the tattoos was edited, likely in an attempt to add context\n\nThe photo held by Trump shows four knuckle tattoos — a marijuana leaf, a smiley face with X's for eyes, a crucifix and a skull. We confirmed the existence of these tattoos on Abrego Garcia's hand by cross-checking with other images of him. Two separate photos in USA Today stories (one came from El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele's social media and the other was credited to CASA) featured the knuckle tattoos, although only the skull and cross were visible in one of them.\n\nHowever, Trump's \"proof\" also contained \"MS-13\" spelled across the knuckles and a description of the four tattoos underneath — \"marijuana, smile, cross, skull.\" When Moran pushed back against Trump in the April 29 ABC News interview (at timestamp 22:00), Trump made it clear he believed the text \"MS-13\" present above the symbols was real, not annotated with editing software.\n\n\"It says M-S-one-three,\" he told Moran.\n\nThose elements were not present in the other photos in the USA Today articles, indicating they were added to Trump's photo after the fact. Moran tried to move on by saying the tattoos could be \"interpreted\" as connecting Abrego Garcia to MS-13 (this is not really true, as we'll see in the next section), but Trump did not budge.\n\n\"He had MS as clear as you can be. Not 'interpreted,'\" Trump said.\n\nMoran pointed out that other photos of Abrego Garcia clearly showed he did not literally have the gang's name tattooed on his knuckles. Trump still refused to acknowledge he was wrong.\n\n\"He's got MS-13 on his knuckles,\" he said.\n\nDespite what the president claimed, Abrego Garcia did not have the gang's name literally \"tattooed onto his knuckles.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia's tattoos did not match known MS-13 tattoos\n\nSnopes reached out to several experts in gang tattoos to learn more about the symbolism in MS-13 tattoos and whether Abrego Garcia's tattoos matched those symbols. We also reached out to ICE for comment. We had not heard back from any of them at the time of publishing.\n\nLooking at other photos of MS-13 gang tattoos, however, revealed that members of the gang have its name literally tattooed on their bodies in some form, generally an \"MS,\" a \"13\" or both. A source from ICE reportedly told the New York Post that if Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13, getting such a tattoo would have been a requirement. However, Snopes was unable to independently verify this claim.\n\nIf MS-13 members are required to have a rather blatant \"MS\" or \"13\" tattoo and if Abrego Garcia was actually involved with the gang, the Trump administration would presumably be able to share a photo of such a tattoo. The fact that the four knuckle tattoos, none of which were \"MS13,\" were the supposed proof undermined the administration's claim of his affiliation with the gang.\n\nThe ICE source who reportedly spoke to the New York Post also said he had \"never heard of those resemblances being made\" when asked if Abrego Garcia's knuckle tattoos signified membership in MS-13.\n\nRegardless of whether Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13 or not, the U.S. Constitution grants him the right to due process and the Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration on April 10 to \"facilitate\" his return. As of this writing, the administration had not complied with the ruling."}

Apple laws… [+4793 chars]", "title": "The hammer falls on Apple’s malicious-compliance scheme", "fullContent": "By Jason Snell\n\nThe hammer falls on Apple’s malicious-compliance scheme\n\nTim Cook specifically approved enhanced “scare screen” language, according to the court ruling.\n\nU.S. District Court judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled largely in Apple’s favor in the Epic v. Apple lawsuit back in 2021, but she did find that Apple’s requirement that apps only use Apple’s payment methods and not link to external methods was fundamentally anticompetitive. So she ordered Apple to change its behavior. After two failed appeals, Apple was forced to follow her orders.\n\nIn a judgment handed out on Wednesday, Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple acted in contempt by failing to follow her orders and scheming to find ways to avoid them, that at least one executive lied under oath, and concluded that Apple has so brazenly botched the aftermath of her order that several of its longstanding App Store policies are now entirely void.\n\nIt was a bad day in court for Apple. And a self-inflicted one. As Gonzalez Rogers writes in her finding:\n\nApple’s response to the Injunction strains credulity. After two sets of evidentiary hearings, the truth emerged. Apple, despite knowing its obligations thereunder, thwarted the Injunction’s goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream. Remarkably, Apple believed that this Court would not see through its obvious cover-up.\n\nWhat the judge found back in 2021 was that Apple’s 30 percent cut of App Store in-app purchases was fundamentally uncompetitive, as was Apple’s rule that prevented app developers from pointing users to external purchase options on the web. She ordered that Apple change its behavior, but instead Apple did pretty much what we all imagined they had done: cook up a scheme that seemed to follow the order but made the result so unpalatable that developers would opt for the status quo instead.\n\nThanks to the power of the subpoena, Gonzalez Rogers has brought receipts. There’s a large document trail indicating that Apple reverse engineered a 27% commission for external transactions (including a lengthy post-referral royalty period) in order to make them no better than just using Apple’s own internal payment system. When a major app developer pointed out that the overhead of external payment systems was more than the commonly-cited 3% (meaning that the entire thing would be a net money loser), Apple celebrated the good news.\n\nApple also attempted to engineer the directive to allow external links in apps by creating new barriers and requirements that would similarly defang those orders. It created full-page “scare screens” (I referred to them as “This App May Kill You” screens), demanded that all links be to static URLs (neutering their utility), and kept editing the warning labels to dissuade users as much as possible from ever agreeing to follow the link. (Cook is specifically credited with amping up the language in the warning screens.)\n\nThe company’s internal struggle is fascinating to read about. While Apple Fellow and longtime App Store overseer Phil Schiller doesn’t come across entirely smelling like a rose, he does end up looking far better than literally any other Apple employee in the ruling. Schiller “advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction”—imagine that!—while Tim Cook, CFO Luca Maestri, and the company’s finance team instead decided to concoct a strategy of malicious compliance that led to the poison pill of the 27% commission.\n\n“Cook chose poorly,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote.\n\nNot only did Apple attempt to find ways to circumvent the injunction, but it fatally hid their discussions from the judge. While Schiller gets credit from Gonzalez Rogers for sitting through the trial and reading the final decision, the judge suggests that his colleagues at Apple did not. Most troubling is the behavior of Apple’s Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, who the judge says “outright lied under oath” multiple times. She referred her ruling to the U.S. Attorney’s office in San Francisco for possible criminal prosecution of Apple generally and Roman specifically.\n\n“At every step Apple considered whether its actions would comply, and at every step Apple chose to maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream over compliance,” she wrote.\n\nBecause Apple has proven itself untrustworthy, the judge has decided that the time for talk is over. “This is an injunction, not a negotiation,” she wrote Wednesday. “There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order.” As a result, she has now enjoined Apple entirely from impeding the ability of developers to communicate with users or charging a commission for external transactions. In other words, Apple had its chance to comply, but since it refused to do so reasonably, it’s going to get hammered.\n\nIn the least surprising response possible, Apple says it will appeal. Maybe this time it’ll take things a bit more seriously.\n\nIf you appreciate articles like this one, support us by becoming a Six Colors subscriber.

Take, for example, this fascinating nugget:\n\nInternally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly.\n\nCook choosing poorly isn’t just that he opted to side with Maestri rather than Schiller, it’s that he chose to make a risky bet. He rolled the dice on trying to hold on to as much App Store revenue as he possibly could, in the hopes that Apple would simply…get away with it. That may have worked for a while, but the bill has come due, and the end result is likely to be a significant blow to Apple’s entire App Store model.\n\nOn a surface level, Cook’s bet would appear to be purely about the money, because isn’t it always? (CFO Luca Maestri being on the side of charging the commission certainly supports that idea.) But at the same time, it’s hard to imagine that flouting compliance like this was worth the few…billion, perhaps?…dollars that Apple has made via this mechanism over the last few years.\n\nWhich is why I think that more than purely being a matter of bottom line, it was about exerting control. Unfortunately, the end result probably means Apple will lose even more control than it will revenue.\n\nCompetition is good for the soul\n\nUltimately, though, I think this decision could be good for Apple—and especially good for its customers. Because getting rid of these long-time ridiculous measures forces Apple to compete—which, lest we forget, was the entire point of this court case in the first place.\n\nYes, some developers may continue to use Apple’s purchases system because it’s easy and integrated, but a good many of them will probably look at that 15-30 percent commission and think maybe it’s better to put in a little extra work to go outside the store.\n\nIn that case, what’s Apple going to do? It would be bad business for the company to just keep its terms the way they are, holding onto its “my way or the highway” philosophy. I have to assume that—at the very least—it will lower the commission. Because getting 5 or 10 percent is unarguably better than zero percent.\n\nApple could, of course, have done this long, long ago and frankly should have even before this case started. The closest they ever got was the Apple Small Business Program, which launched in 2020. While the program cut the commission for those making under the $1 million threshold, its structure always felt more beneficial to Apple. One could argue that disincentivized developers to try and make their apps popular and to generate revenue, lest they accidentally cross that threshold.\n\nThe same is true in the European Union, where Apple’s attempt at recouping its investments via structures like the Core Technology Fee make it unattractive to switch away from Apple’s existing terms and thus actually have a depressive effect on developers taking chances.\n\nGood riddance, goodwill\n\nAll of this amounts to Apple squandering the goodwill that its products have long engendered. As longtime journalist and developer Christina Warren noted on Mastodon:\n\nYou want to know why visionOS has no devs/apps? A big reason that I’ve long argued is that Apple abused the goodwill it had with its developer community over capricious IAP/linking strategies. Apple assumed devs needed Apple more than Apple needed devs. And for the iPhone, maybe that’s true. But for new platforms, it isn’t. When you actively kick someone every time they come to hang out, don’t be surprised when they don’t come to your house anymore.\n\nYeah. Apps and developers enrich Apple’s ecosystem. They help enhance the platforms and devices, turning them into things that people want to use. But the company’s overriding behavior over the last fifteen years has been to try and squeeze those developers for everything they’re worth, using its platform control as a cudgel instead of treating them as partners.\n\nAdapt or die, the old saying goes. And though Apple might not be in danger of dying if it doesn’t make these changes—as I just wrote the chances of them ever really dying are slim—it’s still not without damage. To paraphrase the immortal words of one of our greatest heroines, the more Apple tightens its grip, the more revenue will slip through its fingers.\n\nThe thing that Apple used to be so good at understanding is that the bottom line isn’t just about how the numbers add up. Apple has long been a company that prides itself on its image and its brand, and marring that, whether it be via contentious relationships with developers or seemingly bending over backwards for authoritarians, does have an effect in the long term.\n\n[Dan Moren is the East Coast Bureau Chief of Six Colors.

This cheeky feline adds charm and humour to the storyline, and now he’s bringing that same sense of whimsy to a new “Kiki’s Delivery Service Watercolour Flower” collection.\n\nThere are five products to collect in the range, and each one features a design that looks like it’s been finished in pastel watercolours, perhaps by painter Ursula, who also appears in the film.\n\nThe series begins with the Square Pouch (2,860 yen [US$20.11]), which is the perfect size for carrying makeup and accessories.\n\nThe soft color scheme on the outside of the pouch contrasts with the inner fabric, which uses a Kiki’s Delivery Service-inspired bordeaux hue to create a sophisticated, adult aesthetic.\n\n▼ Inner pockets help to keep things neat…\n\n▼…and it zips up securely with Kiki on the zipper pull.\n\n▼ Next up, we have the Tissue Pouch (2,420 yen).\n\nWith a convenient front opening, this is a handy way to keep your tissues clean and easily accessible.\n\nIn addition to holding small tissue packs, the pouch has a zip section for carrying small essentials like medicine and lip balm.\n\n▼ Now we move on to the Slim Pouch (2,420 yen).\n\nThe length of this product gives it extra versatility, so you can use it to store pens, brushes, combs, and long cosmetics items like mascara.\n\n▼ Next, we have the Mirror (2,860 yen).\n\nThe convenient folded design makes this mirror convenient to store and carry, so you can use it at home or on the go.\n\n▼ Finally, we have the Pass Case (3,080 yen).\n\nDesigned to hold travel cards and passes, this case comes with five pockets in total so you can store a lot within its slim shape.\n\nPerhaps the sweetest element of the design is the gorgeous reel that attaches to the case, allowing you to keep it secure and easy to use when rushing to board public transport.\n\nThe collection is a beautiful homage to Kiki’s Delivery Service and the sweet black cat who’s so beloved by fans, and it can be purchased at Donguri Kyowakoku stores and online (links below) while stocks last.\n\nSource: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\nTop image: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\nInsert images: Donguri Kyowakoku (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

While this update does not introduce a large number of new features, it prioritizes enhancing the user experience and addressing existing issues. Positioned as a bridge between iOS 18.4 and the anticipated iOS 19, iOS 18.5 plays a critical role in Apple’s ongoing software development strategy. The video below from iReviews gives us more details on what to expect from the iOS 18.5 update.\n\nPerformance Enhancements\n\niOS 18.5 brings noticeable improvements in system performance, making sure a smoother and faster experience for users. Benchmarks, including Geekbench scores, reveal gains in both single-core and multi-core performance. These enhancements result in faster app launches, smoother multitasking, and reduced lag during resource-intensive tasks. Apple has also optimized system efficiency, allowing demanding apps to run more consistently without slowdowns. These refinements make everyday interactions with your device feel more seamless and responsive.\n\nBattery Life Optimization\n\nBattery efficiency is a standout focus in iOS 18.5. Apple has implemented advanced power management techniques to extend battery life, even during periods of heavy usage. Whether your device is brand new or has experienced some battery degradation, you are likely to notice longer usage times between charges. Additionally, background processes have been fine-tuned to minimize unnecessary power consumption. These adjustments ensure your device remains efficient throughout the day, reducing the need for frequent recharging and enhancing overall usability.\n\nEnhanced Stability and Reliability\n\nStability remains a cornerstone of iOS 18.5, with Apple addressing numerous bugs and glitches reported in previous versions.

System-wide stability enhancements ensure a more dependable experience, whether you are browsing the web, managing emails, or using other essential features. This focus on reliability makes iOS 18.5 a robust update for users seeking a smoother and more consistent operating system.\n\nSubtle User Interface Refinements\n\nWhile iOS 18.5 does not introduce a major redesign, it includes several subtle updates to the user interface that enhance usability. Two new wallpapers have been added, offering fresh customization options for personalizing your device. The Photos app has been updated to remove the “Recover All” and “Delete All” buttons, simplifying photo management and reducing the risk of accidental deletions. Additionally, the Mail app now features updated splash screens, giving it a more modern and polished appearance. These small but meaningful changes contribute to a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.\n\nImproved Search Functionality in Settings\n\nNavigating the increasingly complex Settings app is now more efficient, thanks to refinements in the search functionality. Whether you are adjusting privacy settings, configuring notifications, or managing accessibility options, the improved search tool helps you locate specific settings quickly and effortlessly. This enhancement is particularly beneficial for users who may not be familiar with the layout of the Settings menu, saving time and reducing frustration.\n\nConnectivity Enhancements for CarPlay\n\nFor users who rely on CarPlay, iOS 18.5 delivers significant connectivity improvements. Persistent issues that caused disconnections and lag during use have been resolved, making sure a smoother and more reliable experience when integrating your iPhone with your vehicle’s infotainment system. These fixes enhance both convenience and safety, making CarPlay a more dependable tool for navigation, communication, and entertainment while driving.\n\nCustomization Through New Wallpapers\n\nApple continues to prioritize user customization with the addition of new wallpaper options in iOS 18.5. While this update may seem minor, it reflects Apple’s commitment to providing users with tools to personalize their devices. These fresh wallpaper designs allow for greater creativity and individuality, contributing to a more engaging and visually appealing user experience.\n\nIncremental App Updates\n\nSeveral core apps have received incremental updates that enhance their functionality and usability. The Mail app now features updated splash screens, offering a cleaner and more modern look. Meanwhile, the Photos app has been streamlined to improve navigation and simplify photo management. These small adjustments collectively enhance the overall user experience, making everyday tasks more intuitive and efficient.\n\nAnticipating Future Updates\n\nAs iOS 18.5 rolls out, Apple is already preparing for the next iteration, iOS 18.6. This upcoming update is expected to build on the improvements introduced in iOS 18.5, further refining performance and addressing any remaining issues. Looking further ahead, iOS 19 is set to debut on June 9th, promising significant changes and new features that will mark a major milestone in Apple’s software evolution. These future updates highlight Apple’s ongoing commitment to innovation and user satisfaction.\n\nStay informed about the latest in iOS 18.5 performance improvements by exploring our other resources and articles.\n\nSource & Image Credit: iReviews\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

However, Apple develops both “Fall” and “Spring” versions of iOS each year, with our website’s analytics logs indicating that both iOS 19.0 and iOS 19.4 are in active development within the company.\n\nThe start of iOS 19.4 development comes after Apple delayed its personalized Siri features until some point “in the coming year.”\n\nApple first previewed the personalized Siri features during its WWDC 2024 keynote last June. The enhancements were initially expected to launch with iOS 18.4 a month ago, but they are now expected to arrive at some point during the iOS 19 cycle. Many well-connected Apple reporters and observers believe the features will not be available until 2026, so it is quite possible that they will launch as part of iOS 19.4 next year."}
