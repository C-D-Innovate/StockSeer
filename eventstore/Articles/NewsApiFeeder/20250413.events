How do you do that? Well, funny you should ask...\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nAmong the common reasons that people don’t update their software are: an unwillingness to interrupt their work or tasks, a fear of bugs or flaws in the new update and a reluctance to change a familiar interface.\n\nThese are all understandable enough, however when you don’t update your operating system, software or antivirus suite what you’re essentially doing is leaving giant holes open making it particularly easy for hackers to access your system.\n\nMany software updates can be automated or scheduled around a convenient time so it’s best to make sure you don’t avoid updates or leave your machine vulnerable when possible\n\n2. Hanging on to older versions of applications\n\n(Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nEven after you’ve updated a program, don’t forget that some older versions may not automatically update or remove themselves after a new version is installed.\n\nJust like with un-updated software, keeping an old version of a program on your system alongside a new one is essentially a gateway that a hacker can exploit. It’s like a giant hole in a fence that any thief could walk through which basically renders the fence meaningless.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n3. Disabling User Account Control (UAC) features\n\n(Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nThe “User Account Control” feature sends an alert whenever a program tries to make changes to Windows settings and particularly anything that would require Admin privileges.\n\nIf it’s disabled, that means you get absolutely zero warning if a program (either benign or malicious) attempts to make any changes to the Windows operating system. The only benefit is you get slightly fewer pings and alerts, and the downside is… far greater than that, so it's best to leave this one enabled even if it is a little annoying.\n\n4. Clicking on any link, QR code, attachment or file\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nThere is no quicker way to infect your computer with malware than to click on all the things.\n\nIn fact, don't just click on anything you receive via email or in a message is one of the pieces of advice we include in almost every article we write about malware for a reason. You really, really shouldn’t do it.\n\nThat link in an unexpected text message? Don’t click it. A random attachment sent by a stranger in an email? Don’t click it. A download button on a website that just popped up while you were browsing? Yep. You guessed right – don’t click it.\n\nUnless it’s something you were expecting, and you know the sender, do not under any circumstances click that link, extension, file, download, code or attachment.\n\n5. Downloading programs from anywhere\n\n(Image credit: NurPhoto / Getty Images)\n\nOne of the fastest ways to pick up malware, ransomware, infostealers or other malicious software is to put them on your computer yourself via a quick Google search and clicking on the first downloadable result for whatever service or software you’re on the hunt for.\n\nAn easy rule to follow is to make sure you’re always downloading apps and software from an official website or app store. It’s honestly not that much harder to make sure you’re at the correct site or app store to start with, so why risk winding up with a malicious file?\n\n6. Piracy, cracks and keygens\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nThough it may seem easy enough to poke around on the web to find one of the many of dozens of cracked files or keygens for a slightly-less-than-legal copy of Windows or Adobe Photoshop in order to save some cash, it’s certainly going to cost you way, way more.\n\nEspecially when you realize that what you’ve actually downloaded is a malicious file that’s stolen a bunch of your personal data and credit card information.\n\nDownloading pirated software or other content online is the easiest and quickest way to end up with a malware infection. So don't do so yourself and make sure that everyone in your household isn't either.\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nThough not as popular as they once were, shortened URL services like bit.ly and TinyURL were once used much more frequently.\n\nWhile they certainly have plenty of legitimate uses, they’re also perfect for concealing a link’s true destination. Which means if users don’t have any sort of link preview add-on in their browser, these little links can be an ideal vector to get victims to navigate blindly to phishing sites or to downloading malicious files.\n\n8. Using open, unsecured Wi-Fi\n\n(Image credit: Getty)\n\nIt doesn’t really matter if you’re connecting to an open guest account at the local laundromat, or if you’ve just left your own network open to everyone.\n\nEither way, it’s a genuinely bad idea. First, if you’re connecting to random open, unsecured Wi-Fi networks, please just start using cellular data instead. And if you’ve been leaving your own wireless network open and unsecured, now is the time to fix that as well.\n\nUnsecured Wi-Fi routers are an incredibly common way for malware to enter your network, and it’s easy to get started securing your wireless router.\n\nThese days, many of the best Wi-Fi routers and the best mesh Wi-Fi systems ship with security software built-in. However, it's up to you to configure it and keep it updated.\n\n9. Surfing on an administrator enabled account\n\n(Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nSomething that is actually a pretty easy security fix right out of the gate is to make sure you’re using a Standard account and not an Administrator account.\n\nThough it may seem useful to be operating under an Admin account because it offers you more access and control, a lot of different types of malware and exploits actually won’t run if you’re using a Standard account. So, if you need to use your Administrator account, switch over and then switch back because you’re actually protecting your machine by doing so.\n\n(Image credit: ymgerman / Shutterstock)\n\nLook, it’s fine if your car is a classic, your decor is vintage and your music taste isn’t current – but your operating system absolutely should be.\n\nSure, Windows 10 is a perfectly fine OS but it was released in 2015 and that was a decade ago. Think about the amount of things that have changed, technologically, in the past decade.\n\nPatches and updates can only do so much and the reality is that older operating systems, in addition to being rife with potential security vulnerabilities, can also leave you with a machine that has various performance problems or compatibility issues. No one needs their machine to run harder, just so it can have a higher risk of being infected by exploits and security leaks.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if you're still using Windows 10, you have until October 14 of this year to upgrade to Windows 11. After that time, Windows 10 will no longer receive new security updates and patches which puts people still using this version of Windows at serious risk of getting hacked.\n\n11. Using the same password everywhere\n\n(Image credit: anyaberkut via Getty Images)\n\nYou know better. You really do. But every time you need to start an account for a new fitness app you impulsively decided to download, purchase a piece of furniture from a new website, or caved into signing up for a new streaming service you’re going to need to register and create a strong, unique password.\n\nMany of us are guilty of being lazy and reusing passwords, which is just a bad habit that leaves our accounts open to being easily hacked.\n\nIf you don’t have one of the best password managers yet, get one. That way you can go back to being lazy! Or better yet, set up a passkey on your mobile device. But at the very least make your password a phrase instead of any of the easy to guess options like 12345.\n\n12. Not using antivirus software\n\n(Image credit: monticello/Shutterstock)\n\nDo you drive without a seatbelt? Probably not. You also probably have smoke alarms in your house, and lock your front door when you leave. You should also have one of the best antivirus software suites on your computer.\n\nUnless for some reason, you’re intentionally interested in leaving your system available for viruses, there’s no reason not to install any of the many free or paid options out there.\n\nEven the safest, hyper-vigilant online habits can only take you so far and all it takes is a one wrong click on a site that’s been hijacked, or falling for the most convincing phishing link in an email, and you’re toast."}

Damn, damn, damn. Just a few weeks ago, I lost my resolve and finally picked up an OLED gaming monitor—so I missed out on this deal, which would have gotten me a much bigger one at a similar price. If you mosey over to eBay, you can find a massive Samsung ultrawide OLED for $879.99, almost a thousand bucks off its original price.\n\nTo be sure, $880 ain’t chicken feed, especially when you can find 49-inch super-wide screens for about half that if you don’t want an OLED panel. But for an OLED screen that can do 5120×1440 resolution—that’s two 1440p panels in one—and still handle 240Hz of refresh for super-speedy games, it’s a downright deal. Assuming your gaming PC can actually handle pushing nearly 1.8 billion pixels that quickly, of course.\n\nThis gigantic 49-inch display is impressive, but not perfect. It’s designed for desktops, as its USB-C ports are unfortunately incapable of video. And you’re paying for a lot of extras you might not use, like Samsung’s smart TV interface for streaming apps and games over Wi-Fi, and the 5-watt speakers you should ignore. For more details on the ups and downs of this screen, check out the full PCWorld review. Or see our roundup of the best monitors for comparison.\n\nBuyDig is selling this monitor on eBay new—not refurbished!—so you should get the full warranty along with it. The listing shows a price of $1099.99, but you can use coupon code OUTLET20 at checkout to get 20 percent off, bringing the final price down to $879.99.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nLess than 10 percent of all plastic is recycled, a rate that has remained stagnant even as production has exploded.\n\nThe amount of plastic being recycled around the world is stagnant at less than 10% with most new plastic still made from fossil fuels, a new study said Thursday.\n\nResearchers from Tsinghua University in China said the rate of recycling had barely budged even as plastic production had exploded, presenting a \"pressing global environmental challenge.\"\n\nTheir findings, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, come as nations prepare to battle again over a treaty to address plastic pollution after the last round of negotiations failed to broker an agreement.\n\nPlastic has been found in the depths of the remotest oceans and in snow atop the highest mountains, and tiny particles have been detected in blood and breast milk.\n\nYet despite growing international concern, there has been \"a notable lack of comprehensive analysis of plastics along their supply chain,\" wrote Quanyin Tan and colleagues.\n\nTo address this, they drew on national statistics, industry reports, and international databases to create the first detailed global analysis of the plastics sector in 2022 from manufacture to disposal.\n\nThey found that just 9.5% of the 400 million tonnes of new plastic in 2022 was produced from recycled materials.\n\n\"The global recycling rate remained stagnant... reflecting little improvement from previous years,\" wrote the authors.\n\nThe rest was produced from fossil fuels, predominantly oil and gas, demonstrating \"little progress\" in addressing environmental concerns related to plastics production.\n\n\"The high reliance on fossil-fuel feedstocks for plastics production will further compromise the global efforts to mitigate climate change,\" the authors wrote.\n\nRecycling roadblocks\n\nContamination with food and labels made some plastics more difficult to recycle, while the diversity and complexity of additives in materials posed another obstacle.\n\nBut another hindrance is purely economic: it is often cheaper to make new or \"virgin\" plastic than it is to recycle it.\n\n\"This economic barrier discourages investment in recycling infrastructure and technology, perpetuating the cycle of low recycling rates,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThey identified the United States, the largest consumer of plastic per capita, as having one of the lowest recycling rates with just 5% reused.\n\nThey also noted a \"significant shift\" in global waste disposal, with landfill in decline and around one-third of plastic waste being incinerated.\n\nLandfill remained the main destination for most plastic waste, accounting for 40% of the global total.\n\nBut burning was \"emerging as the most practiced method for managing plastic waste\" with the European Union, China and Japan having among the highest incineration rates.\n\nHowever the study did not account for \"the significant role\" of informal waste disposal schemes, which could affect the overall recycling rate, the authors noted.\n\nIn September, a separate study in Nature by researchers from the University of Leeds found that burning plastic in dumps and open fires was as big a problem for the planet as littering.\n\nThat study said burning plastic informally, mostly in poorer countries where no alternatives exist, spread plastic in the environment, worsened air quality, and exposed workers to toxic chemicals.\n\nThe authors of the more recent study said they hoped their research would \"support the treaty negotiations\" for a world-first plastic treaty which resume in August in Geneva after the last round collapsed.\n\n© 2025 AFP"}

Those who were a step ahead might’ve been using Windows 3.1, but even that was a superimposed user interface on top of MS-DOS. Windows was still pretty darn unfamiliar to people back then, so in 1995, Microsoft came up with a more user-friendly interface called Microsoft Bob (codename Utopia).\n\nBob was a complete replacement for Windows 3.1, changing the way users interacted with their PCs. Instead of “windows,” you interfaced with a digital house with all files, folders, and features represented as parts of the house. For example, there was a room for mail and one for the calendar, plus furniture and animated characters (like the dog Rover), all in a welcoming cartoony look. The intent was to lower the usability barriers for PC beginners and make computers easier to navigate.\n\nHowever, user enthusiasm was limited and critical reception was poor. Hardly anyone bought Bob—only about 30,000 copies were sold—and it made high demands on the hardware, requiring 8MB of RAM, which was a lot in 1995. Microsoft discontinued Bob about a year later, around the time Windows 95 came out, but that wasn’t the end for Bob.\n\nMicrosoft Bob makes a comeback… sort of\n\nWith Windows XP’s release in 2001, the failed Microsoft Bob made a curious comeback. When Microsoft put Windows XP on installation CDs, they discovered that there were still 30 MB free on those discs—so Microsoft decided to fill up that space. With what, you ask? With an encrypted form of Bob, of course!\n\nFormer Microsoft employee and Windows developer Raymond Chen explained the reasoning in a 2008 issue of TechNet Magazine:\n\n“The result was a rather feeble attempt to slow down the people who like to make illegal copies of Windows. Somebody decided to fill that extra capacity on the CD with dummy data and to have the Windows Setup program verify that the dummy data was still there. This, the logic went, would force people downloading a copy of the CD image to download an additional thirty or so megabytes of data. Remember, this was back in the day when ‘broadband’ hadn’t yet become a household word and mainstream users were using dial-up connections. Having to transfer an additional thirty megabytes of data over a 56Kb modem was a bit of an obstacle to slow users down—not that it would slow them down much by today’s standards.”\n\nBut why Bob’s code of all things? Chen continues:\n\n“The person who was asked to implement this check needed a source for the dummy data. Now, he could have just called the CryptGenRandom function to generate 30 megabytes of cryptographically random bytes, but where’s the fun in that? Instead, he dug through the archives and found a copy of Microsoft Bob. He took all the floppy disk images and combined them into one big file. The contents of the Microsoft Bob floppy disk images are not particularly random, so he decided to scramble up the data by encrypting it. When it came time to enter the encryption key, he just smashed his hand haphazardly across the keyboard and out came an encrypted copy of Microsoft Bob. That’s what went into the unused space as ballast data on the Windows XP CD.”\n\nAnd so, everyone who bought Windows XP also (unknowingly) received a copy of the totally flopped Microsoft Bob.\n\nIt’s kind of funny in the grand scheme, considering we once named Microsoft Bob as one of the worst tech products of all time. Still, little Easter eggs like this are expected and unavoidable when you have a history as extensively storied as Microsoft does."}

It’s a mosaic of tightly arranged brass rule and spacing material, made by a Finnish typographer Valto Malmiola in 1937. Note, it’s not a single piece of metal, and it’s neither engraved nor etched… it’s thousands of individual metal bits, pieced together by hand, and locked tightly into a frame for printing.\n\nFigure 1. Forme for the Jean Sibelius print at the Media Museum and Archives Merkki.\n\nWhen inked and pressed onto paper, it creates an image of the famous Finnish composer Jean Sibelius.\n\nFigure 2. Portrait of Jean Sibelius, composed entirely of brass rule.\n\nBut, to me at least, the resulting image itself is not what’s interesting here. After all, it’s a fairly conventional portrait of Sibelius. What’s interesting and what makes the whole thing remarkable is how it’s made and how it came to be. It’s essentially a form of proto-ASCII art: intentionally (mis)using techniques and materials originally intended for printing text to create a complex image. What led to its creation? What is it anyway? Where did Malmiola get the idea to use letterpress in such an unconventional way?\n\nThe Use of Rules\n\nMalmiola writes about the inspiration for the picture in the Finnish printing arts periodical Kirjapainotaito:\n\n“When our renowned master composer Jean Sibelius turned 70 in 1935, [...] I was struck with a strange dream of trying to replicate his image using impractical typographic methods. I had previously seen pictures \"set\" with Monotype fonts and decorations in foreign graphic design trade journals, particularly \"The Inland Printer\", so I decided to try, but not with type and ornament, but with rule.\n\nTo give a bit of context, in letterpress printing, rules are strips of metal, often brass or type-cast metal, used for printing lines. They’ve been an integral part of printing since the early 1500’s.\n\nFigure 3. Varying rule styles and thicknesses.\n\nRules are typically used for decoration, as a border around the edges of pages, or for creating simple designs on book covers or brochures. A variety of tones from light grey to solid black can be made by combining rules of different widths. Rules also have a functional use as dividers for adding structure and visual hierarchy in tables, catalogues, and other layouts.\n\nFigure 4. A common use for brass rule. This is very familiar to us even today: think of spreadsheets.\n\nInstead of using brass rules conventionally, Malmiola used them like building blocks. By carefully arranging rules of varying thicknesses in horizontal and vertical lines, he managed to make complex images.\n\nFigure 5a. Closeup of the forme shows the individual elements and their positioning.\n\nFigure 5b. Closeup of the print shows how the picture is formed after printing.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with letterpress techniques, or those who have never attempted to do a complex arrangement, the sheer insanity of Malmiola’s task might not be obvious.\n\nEach element is carefully chosen or cut neatly into precise lengths and arranged in a way that leaves no air-gaps. Even the smallest unfilled space could lead to an unstable structure and make the whole thing unprintable. The level of precision, patience and skill needed to do what Malmiola did should should not be understated. How was it made?\n\nThe Construction of the Print\n\nTo plan the construction, Malmiola experimented with several approaches. He writes that the first attempt was a pitiful failure. The second attempt fared better. He came up with a “coding” system to classify different types of lines and spaces according to tonal values, by measuring the lights and shadows of the reference image, and marked each line with the resulting string of code. But he found the process too laborious and abandoned the idea. He also experimented with a “square system”, but doesn’t elaborate what he meant by that. My guess is that he tried using grid paper to map tonal values.\n\nUnfortunately Malmiola doesn’t reveal his final method, but Paavo Haavi, who worked with Malmiola at K. K. Printing, says he used a one-to-one photographic enlargement of the reference image to help in the typesetting process . The reference Malmiola likely used is a photo of Jean Sibelius that appeared on the cover of Suomen Kuvalehti -magazine in 1925.\n\nFigure 7. Cover of Suomen Kuvalehti -magazine which Malmiola used as a reference.\n\nWhat’s clear, just by observing the image, is that Malmiola used what’s essentially a manual half-toning process by plotting the reference image into tonal values, which he then painstakingly constructed with brass rule, piece by piece. This kind of half-toning process is typically done by a photographic screen or some automated system, but Malmiola had to do it by hand. Where the reference image required a black area, Malmiola used a thick rule stacked tightly next to each other, and where a gray tone was required, he alternated between fine rules and spacers, creating illusions of various gray tones.\n\nFigure 6. Closeup of the face shows how the various tones are constructed\n\nThe final print measures just 28 × 37,5 cm (~11\" × 14.7\" in.) but is crafted using a staggering 30 000 ciceros of brass rule (which equals to around 135 meters or ~442 feet) in addition to some spacers and quadrants for the white space.\n\nHaavi also recounts that Malmiola presented the print to Sibelius in person, who reportedly exclaimed, “Tehän se vasta taiteilija olette!” , translating roughly to “Whose the true artist here!” Whether this was sincere or said tongue-in-cheek is not clear, but Sibelius signed the picture anyway and gave permission to include it in the prints, suggesting at least some level of validation and recognition for Malmiola.\n\nMalmiola announced the finished piece in Kirjapainotaito and sold the prints for 10 mk (equivalent to about 4 € today, adjusted for inflation). Given the relatively small size of the Finnish typography scene at the time, there weren’t many who would actually appreciate such a print. The potential for profit was likely quite limited, so as an incentive, Malmiola sold the prints “for the benefit of war orphans” . But despite his efforts, Malmiola had difficulties in selling his prints. As Haavi notes, he had to resort to selling them on the streets of Helsinki and through newspaper ads for years after the print was made.\n\nAfter Malmiola’s death, the original letterpress forme of the Sibelius-print was donated to the hand typesetters guild, and later on to the printing industry workers’ trade division, the Helsinki Print Workers’ Association (HKY). HKY sold prints of it, and used the profits to “enhance the professional skills of young people working in printing”. In 2015, HKY loaned the Sibelius forme to the Media museum and archive Merkki’s printing cellar, where it remains on public display.\n\nMalmiola’s Other Prints\n\nIn addition to the Sibelius-print, Malmiola made at least four others.\n\n1. Bullfinches pecking at rowan tree berries, print on the cover of Kirjapainotaito in 1938\n\nIn 1938, Malmiola created a print featuring bullfinches pecking at rowan tree berries for the 30th anniversary cover of the Kirjapainotaito magazine. Malmiola explained that the tree represents “the tree of professional knowledge”, while the birds symbolize the friends and readers associated with the Kirjapainotaito magazine.\n\nFigure 8. Cover of Kirjapainotaito for February 1938\n\nHe writes about the making of it as follows:\n\n“In this context, we dare to say a few words about the construction of this issue’s cover. Firstly, such a practice should not be pursued by anyone, but since people in the world have so many hobbies… The rowan berries are monotype ornaments the size of cicero em, turned upside down and vaguely shaped with a file to intentionally create a ragged feel. In nature, the birds’ backs are blue-gray, but by using semi-bold lines, the illusion of a third color is evident. […] The slightly incorrect alignment of colors is intentional and enhances the image’s ‘atmospheric content,’ and poor printing, if one generally knows how to print poorly, gives the picture a piquant effect. It remains for the reader to make the final judgment on the validity of the moods elicited by the ‘image’.\n\nWhile the Sibelius print is quite dull in its precise imitation of the reference image, this artwork manages to take advantage of the unique properties of the technique. The inherent limitations in the material qualities of letterpress and brass rule, which result in sharp and square angles, gives the print almost a digital, or pixelated, look. What was, at the time, probably thought of as clumsy and naive, seems almost strikingly contemporary now. There is a nice balance between the rigid mechanical precision of typographic forms and the organic natural forms of the tree and birds, giving it a certain charm that’s missing in the Sibelius-print.\n\nAccording to Haavi, the forme for this print was disassembled after printing to release the material back into use.\n\nFigure 9. An original print can be found at the offices of Helsingin Kirjatyöntekijäin Yhdistys ry.\n\n2. Lighthouse, print on the cover of Kirjapainotaito in 1939\n\nIn 1939, Malmiola’s pictorial typography had become well known among the readers of Kirjapainotaito.\n\nFigure 10. Cover of Kirjapainotaito for November 1939\n\nThis print is a lot simpler than the previous ones he made, because Malmiola used a Monotype machine to make it, instead of composing the image with pre-made brass rules, like he had done earlier with the Sibelius-print. The Monotype machine also forced him to use only horizontal rules. The magazine includes a short description of the cover:\n\n“The composer of the structure explains that the image was derived from the theme ‘the waves of time strike harshly.’ The line material used is from monotype casting, which explains why the image surface could be modified by even breaking the material, something that, of course, would not be acceptable or even permissible with ordinary lines.\n\nHe programmed the machine to cast custom-sized rules from type metal (= an alloy comprising lead, antimony, and tin). Unlike brass, type metal was bulk material and reusable. This meant that any errors could be corrected by melting the metal down for reuse, which made it a more cost-effective option than the expensive brass. The process, however, still demanded a lof of manual effort in hand-setting type and trimming the rules to the exact lengths needed to construct the image.\n\n3. Carradale-print, 1942\n\nIn 1942 Malmiola finished another piece to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Finnish printing art.\n\nFigure 11. Carradale, composed with 325 meters of Monotype rule\n\nAs far as I know, this is Malmiola’s largest print, measuring 45 × 53 cm (~18\" × 21\" in.) and uses an astonishing 72 000 ciceros of rule (around 325 meters or ~1 065 feet). Even though it was also made with a Monotype machine, and uses only horizontal rule, it took Malmiola 140 hours to complete.\n\nFigure 13. Close-up of the print Figure 14. Close-up of the print\n\nEven though Monotype machines make it possible to reuse the material, Malmiola’s wanted to preserve the layout, rather than melting it down. The type metal needed for the construction of the print was provided by the Valtioneuvoston kirjapaino (Government Printing Office), and not by Malmiola’s own employer, K. K. Printing, who probably lacked the required material (or the will to give it). Yet, according to Haavi, the forme was melted anyhow, after an apprentice dropped it on the floor.\n\nFigure 12. The original photograph\n\nThe print is based on a photo by Allan C. Green of a four-masted steel barque named Carradale (which Malmiola incorrectly called a frigate), built in 1889. In 1914 the ship was sold to Finnish shipowner J. Tengström, and the photo appeared in various magazines at that time (see for example 1922 Nuori Voima № 48).\n\n4. Forest-print, 1943\n\nI don’t know much about the creation of this print, but I saw it for the first time when I visited the offices of Helsingin Kirjatyöntekijäin Yhdistys ry in Helsinki. This print also uses only horizontal rules, but the construction is much less precise than any of the others, resulting in some charming raggedness, which works well with the gloomy moon-lit forest scene.\n\nFigure 15. This print by Malmiola is displayed at the offices of Helsingin Kirjatyöntekijäin Yhdistys ry\n\nMalmiola’s Inspiration for the Technique\n\nMany Finnish typographers followed and read foreign typographic journals, which inspired new ideas and techniques. In the late 1920’s, pictorial typography had emerged as a new trend in Germany. This method of producing images became a trendy topic in typographic trade journals. For example, Arthur Grams’ article “Das Buchdrucker als Architekt” (“The Printer as an Architect”) in Typographische Mitteilungen in July 1929 writes about pictorial typography in a way that explains its potential in typesetting:\n\n“Most colleagues are simply unaware of the wealth of forms, particularly elementary forms, concealed within the typesetting case. Yet, it is in these elementary forms that the full and grand allure of picture composition truly emerges; the elementary forms render it an expressive medium for the new demands of the era. They may occasionally appear somewhat grotesque; however, this should not discourage one from exploring their subtleties. We must endeavor to continuously uncover new facets in picture composition, because the elements it comprises are our elements: type! Type belongs to the printer! That is the essence and purpose of picture composition; it is from this perspective that one must consider the matter.\n\nFigure 16. A 1923 German typographic trade journal showcasing the new Silhouette type ornament series by Ludwig Wagner Type Foundry. It was used primarily for pictorial typesetting.\n\nThis new style spread from Germany, and inspired typographers like Valto Malmiola. Malmiola experimented with this style as early as 1933, and advocated for its use in an article titled “Yritys ‘kujeilla’ asiallisesti” (“An Attempt to do ‘Trickery’ Earnestly”) in Kirjapainotaito for December 1933 . He agreed with the idea that typographic elements are not just laying out text, but could be used for artistic expression. This early experiment probably inspired Malmiola to attempt a more ambitious project later on, leading to the creation of the Sibelius-print.\n\nFigure 17. Malmiola’s early experimentations in pictorial typesetting.\n\nIn 1937, when Malmiola wrote about the creation of the Sibelius-print in Kirjapainotaito, he mentioned having seen pictures typeset with Monotype fonts and decorations in The Inland Printer. There are not many pictures set with Monotype in The Inland Printer that would match the year 1934 or 1935, but I found this portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt, composed of 17 000 monotype characters in the May 1935 edition:\n\nFigure 18. Franklin D. Roosevelt, composed of 17 000 monotype characters in The Inland Printer for May, 1935\n\nThis image is not created with brass rule, but with dots and colons. The gray tones are not achieved by purely half-toning optical illusion, but by having a tinted background (originally green) in the shape of the head .\n\nWhile this image matches Malmiola’s description, I suspect his actual inspiration might have been something else. In January 1936, Graafikko, another Finnish trade journal, featured work by a Viennese printer, Carl Fasol. Fasol had developed a method of printing which he called “Stigmatype” already as early as 1860. Some of the stigmatype prints resemble the style and method of construction of Malmiola’s prints. Fasol introduced his invention to the public in 1867 with typeset picture of flowers and a picture of Gutenberg. Both images were reveled and he gained recognition especially among typographers. Fasol turned this into a series of Album for Printing Art, and traveled around Europe selling them, including Finland. .\n\nFigure 19. Carl Fasol’s print of Johannes Gutenber’s house, made almost 70 years before Malmiola’s Sibelius print.\n\nAs a side note: the article also mentions some of Fasol’s prints were donated to Suomen Kirjapainomuseo (Finnish Printing Press Museum), which never actually existed, but the material is currently in the archives of Tekniikan Museo (The Museum of Technology). I went to look for the prints, but sadly couldn’t find them.\n\nBeyond Fasol, there are many other typographers who used rules and other type elements to create pictorial typography in various delightful ways. Just to name a few, there’s Georg Wolffger in 1670, Monpied and Moulinet in ~1840’s and a whole trend of bending and twisting rules into all kinds of shapes in the 1870 – 1890’s. A comprehensive exploration of this phenomena would be required to put Malmiola’s work into proper context, but falls outside the scope of this post.\n\nWhat’s interesting, is that these early practitioners of pictorial typography had recognized the potential of using small, modular, pixel-like elements to construct images. It laid the groundwork for how we understand and manipulate images today by showing how complex images can be made from simple, repeating parts. These early techniques were the building blocks for modern digital imaging, influencing everything from 4-color offset printing to bitmap graphics.\n\nFigure 20. Otto Ellandi’s rule portrait of Lenin, 1970\n\nBut... Why?\n\nPictorial typesetting was not always met with enthusiasm. It was often dismissed as a gimmick or childish dabbling, not just by traditionalists, but also by the rising avantgarde of typography. Jan Tschichold’s hugely influential book The New Typography, published in 1928, strictly forbade the use of any decorative elements or pictorial compositions made with type elements.\n\n“The New Typography has absolutely nothing to do with ‘pictorial’ typesetting (Bildsatz) which has become fashionable recently. In almost all its examples it is the opposite of what we are aiming for.\n\n— Jan Tschichold in The New Typography\n\nTraditionalists, on the other hand, wanted typography to follow the established norms and styles of classical printing. In Finland, V. A. Vuorinen, a member of the Kirjapainotaito editorial team wrote an article in April 1934 titled “Latomisvälinen kuvittamisesta” (“Illustrating with typesetting tools”). In it, he stated that since typesetters usually lack formal artistic training, they should stick to what they know: simple typographic layouts.\n\n“Finally, it should be mentioned that, in my opinion, a cobbler should stick to his last. Illustration is such a demanding task that not everyone is capable of it. At least I have come to the conviction that if a typesetter uses all his means and strength to produce good, proper typography, the value and artistry of the work becomes many times better than just dreaming of images. […] Let pictorial typesetting be seen as a pastime that can be indulged in between more important tasks, but when it’s necessary to produce something quickly, let’s work with letters and proper arrangements if there are no ready-made picture plates available, and most often leave the doomed-to-fail typesetting with illustrative means to the side.\n\nBoth the avantgarde and traditionalists viewed typographic experimentation, like what Malmiola was doing, as ridiculous and detracting from the primary purpose of typography: clear communication.\n\nVuorio’s article might have been written as an indirect response to Malmiola’s “Yritys ‘kujeilla‘ asiallisesti” (“An Attempt to do ‘Trickery‘ Earnestly”) in Kirjapainotaito for December 1933 . In it, Malmiola suggests that the method of creating pictorial typography should be taken seriously. But even then, Malmiola often downplayed his art, referring to his practice as merely a “hobby”. Did he do so to shield himself, and his work, from being too harshly judged as unprofessional by his colleagues?\n\nMalmiola wrote that this kind of work “ought to be executed using straightforward methods; the design should be presented with just a few outlines, and importantly, there needs to be a hint of humor, as too serious an attempt might end up being inadvertently comical.” These thoughts seem somewhat unexpected, especially when contrasted with Malmiola’s solemn portrayal of Sibelius. Maybe Malmiola wanted to prove that his method had real potential for serious and respectful artistic expression by choosing Sibelius as his subject. Maybe he wished that by making a portrait of the renowned composer Jean Sibelius on his 70th birthday would make the technique seem more professional than how it was percieved by others.\n\nWhatever the case may be, Malmiola’s dedication appears to have been driven more by passion, curiosity, and enjoyment rather than by financial or other superficial motives. As noted by Haavi, at that time, many typesetters, including Malmiola, took great pride in their profession and were interested in the discourse happening on an international level . Malmiola was a frequent contributor to Kirjapainotaito, writing short articles and essays, especially about pictorial typesetting. In April 1933 Malmiola wrote an article titled “Mielikuvitus latojan apuna” (“Imagination as an Aid to a Typesetter’s Skills”) where he argued that typesetting, while not a traditional art, requires imagination and creativity to produce exceptional work, and most importantly, to find joy in the work . This seems to have been the case for Malmiola, as he worked on his “hobby” during his free time and quieter work periods.\n\nHowever, I get a sense that he wanted to share his art with a wider audience to show that letterpress was capable of producing actual art, and to contribute to the field he was passionate about. The Sibelius-print was showcased at the 1938 International Handicraft Exhibition in Berlin , and was featured in the Printing Art Quarterly -magazine , alongside the works of A. M. Cassandre, J. C. Leyendecker and László Moholy-Nagy.\n\nMalmiola’s art would not have come to be without the support of his foreman Atte Syvänne, the technical director of the K. K. Printing, and member of Kirjapainotaito editorial staff. Under his leadership, the K. K. Printing had evolved into a well known general printing house in Finland. Syvänne was known for encouraging his employees, and it’s apparent, that in his role as Malmiola’s supervisor (or as the overseer of Malmiola’s own supervisors), he actively supported Malmiola’s interest in pictorial typesetting.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that not many foremen in the printing industry would have allowed the use of valuable resources, such as 30 000 ciceros worth of brass rule, for personal “hobby” projects. But Syvänne shared a passion for the art of printing with Malmiola, and permitted him to use resources for his experiments.\n\nSyvänne also dabbled in pictorial typography himself, and one of his experiments appear on the cover of Kirjapainotaito in June 1936, a year before Malmiola’s Sibelius-print. This might have influenced and inspired Malmiola in his own typographic experiments.\n\nFigure 21. Atte Syvänne’s cover for Kirjapainotaito -magazine is made with brass rule\n\nValto Malmiola’s Short Biography\n\nAs a morbid contrast to the playfulness of his work, I found out that he was a supporter for Nazi ideology after reading his article “Työn aateluus”. This, of course, casts a shadow on his legacy and I debated for a long time if I should even write about him. But, because I already sunk a lot of time into this research, and because his art is unique in the context of (Finnish) typography, and because his work is part of a bigger typographic phenomena, I decided to go ahead anyway. While his work is fascinating, it’s important to view his person with a critical understanding of this context. That said, fuck nazis and fuck Malmiola, may he rot in hell.\n\nFigure 22. A portrait of Valto Malmiola, painted by Topi Valkonen in 1948. The Sibelius-print hangs in the background.

Basically, in NixOS, you can configure your entire system using a configuration.nix file and NixOS will magically (using a bunch of Bash scripts) figure out what needs to be installed and how to do it. For instance, if you want to enable Firefox, you’d add programs.firefox.enable = true; to your configuration.nix . Easy as that.\n\nKublai: Sure that sounds cool, but what if I want to enable Firefox with only 50% probability?\n\nGreat question! The easiest solution would be something like randomNumber = 4 (from this xkcd), but what about doing the RNG using the Nix language so that it’s declarative?\n\nRNG\n\nSadly, Nix doesn’t have built-in RNG since it’s purely functional, but I found a project called rand-nix with this code:\n\nlet pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { }; seed = builtins . replaceStrings [ \"-\" \"\n\n\" ] [ \"\" \"\" ] (builtins . readFile /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid ); hash = builtins . hashString \"sha256\" ; rng = seed: pkgs . lib . fix (self: { int = (builtins . fromTOML \"x=0x ${ builtins . substring 28 8 (hash seed) } \" ) . x; intBetween = x: y: x + pkgs . lib . mod self . int (y - x); next = rng (hash seed); skip = pkgs . lib . flip pkgs . lib . pipe [ (pkgs . lib . flip pkgs . lib . replicate (x: x . next)) (pkgs . lib . pipe self) ]; take = builtins . genList self . skip; }); in { a = (rng seed) . int; b = builtins . readFile /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid ; }\n\nKublai: Whoa, that’s a lot of code! What does it do?\n\nBasically, it reads random data from /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid , SHA256es it, and parses the hex string using builtins.fromTOML and does a bunch of other things that you don’t need to worry about. Anyways, let’s run it with nix eval --file main.nix and see what it prints out:\n\n{ a = 3106154414 ; b = \"\" ; }\n\nSHL: This post uses some experimental Nix features, so if you get any errors, add nix.settings.experimental-features = [\"nix-command\" \"flakes\" \"pipe-operators\"]; to your configuration.nix . The new nix CLI is much better anyways.\n\nLet’s try it again:\n\n{ a = 3106154414 ; b = \"\" ; }\n\nHuh, that doesn’t look right. It’s printing out the same random number each time! And it seems like we can’t read anything from the /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid file!\n\nOne solution to this is to use pkgs.runCommandLocal to get an environment where we can access /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid or /dev/random which I’ll use here for simplicity:\n\nseed = pkgs . runCommandLocal \"myCommand\" {} \"od -A n -t d -N 4 /dev/random > $out\" | > import | > builtins . toString;\n\nYay, now we can access a file with some randomness in it! Sadly… this doesn’t exactly work either. Now the program prints out 1661889355 for me every time I run it!\n\nThis is because pkgs.runCommandLocal creates a Nix derivation which gets cached when we run it. For future runs, Nix will just use the cached value since it thinks this is a pure function! However, the caching depends on the name that we gave the derivation, in this case “myCommand”, so we just need to specify a random value each time we run this program. Easy as that… wait, where do we get that random value from? That’s what we’re trying to do in the first place!\n\nKublai: I know, let’s use the current time!\n\nGood thinking, Kublai. In Nix, we can obtain that using builtins.currentTime . However, this only gives us accuracy down to a second so if we run our program twice quickly, it’ll output the same thing. Also, this function isn’t available in pure evaluation mode. We’ll need some more creativity.\n\nCaching… so troublesome… what if we could detect if we’re using a cached value or not? Let’s give that idea a try in nix repl .\n\nnix-repl > builtins . pathExists (pkgs . runCommandLocal \"meow\" {} \"od -A n -t d -N 4 /dev/random > $out\" ) . outPath true nix-repl > builtins . pathExists (pkgs . runCommandLocal \"meow2\" {} \"od -A n -t d -N 4 /dev/random > $out\" ) . outPath true nix-repl > (pkgs . runCommandLocal \"meow3\" {} \"od -A n -t d -N 4 /dev/random > $out\" ) . outPath \"/nix/store/hajf5106d42xh7h1amx8f32g6fl017gd-meow3\" nix-repl > builtins . pathExists \"/nix/store/hajf5106d42xh7h1amx8f32g6fl017gd-meow3\" false nix-repl > (pkgs . runCommandLocal \"meow3\" {} \"od -A n -t d -N 4 /dev/random > $out\" ) . outPath == \"/nix/store/hajf5106d42xh7h1amx8f32g6fl017gd-meow3\" true\n\nHuh? What’s going on?\n\nSHL: In Nix, strings aren’t just a bunch of characters but also have a context. The string from .outPath has an additional context that causes the derivation to be evaluated while the manually copied string doesn’t.\n\nOh, that’s… interesting. And Nix says that two strings with different contexts are still equal! Insanity! Anyways, we can check a string’s context like this:\n\nnix-repl > builtins . getContext (pkgs . runCommandLocal \"meow3\" {} \"od -A n -t d -N 4 /dev/random > $out\" ) . outPath { \"/nix/store/37psx5dfcn2hnni4hp7jmaql6ynbq8b7-meow3.drv\" = { ... }; }\n\nSince we don’t care about the context at all, let’s just throw it away. (Minor annoyance: I think it would be cleaner to put the |> at the beginning of each line but the Nix REPL complains and insists I put them at the end of the previous line instead.)\n\nnix-repl > (pkgs . runCommandLocal \"meow4\" {} \"od -A n -t d -N 4 /dev/random > $out\" ) . outPath | > builtins . unsafeDiscardStringContext | > builtins . pathExists false\n\nNow for our RNG, we’ll just keep making derivations until we get one that’s not cached! Easy as that. (Note that once we use builtins.unsafeDiscardStringContext , we can no longer import the derivation normally for some reason and have to use builtins.readFile instead.)\n\nlet pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { }; genSeed = seed: let p = pkgs . runCommandLocal seed { } \"od -A n -t d -N 4 /dev/random > $out\" ; in if p . outPath | > builtins . unsafeDiscardStringContext | > builtins . pathExists then genSeed (builtins . readFile p) else builtins . readFile p; seed = genSeed \"why did I do this\" ; hash = builtins . hashString \"sha256\" ; rng = seed: pkgs . lib . fix (self: { int = (builtins . fromTOML \"x=0x ${ builtins . substring 28 8 (hash seed) } \" ) . x; intBetween = x: y: x + pkgs . lib . mod self . int (y - x); next = rng (hash seed); skip = pkgs . lib . flip pkgs . lib . pipe [ (pkgs . lib . flip pkgs . lib . replicate (x: x . next)) (pkgs . lib . pipe self) ]; take = builtins . genList self . skip; }); in (rng seed) . int\n\nTada! Now every time you run this program, it’ll print out a different number, no matter if you run it twice really quickly, if you GC the Nix store, if you enable pure eval mode, whatever. Doesn’t matter. (EDIT: Turns out this trick doesn’t work in pure eval mode since in that mode, you can only access a path using a string with context for that path, but that causes Nix to materialize that path. I’ll come up with a solution, maybe using timing instead?) And that’s how you generate high-quality random numbers in a purely functional language! (Although I’m curious if it’s possible to do this without IFD which I used here.)\n\nIf you thought that wasn’t cursed enough, let’s do some more Nix crimes!\n\nCosine\n\nKublai: Hey, I also want to use the cosine function in my configuration.nix ! If Nix is a real programming language surely it has cosine, right?\n\nUm… why?\n\nKublai: I’d like to uh… eh… I’d like to make my computer sinusoidal! That’s it!\n\nOK, whatever, I won’t question that. Let’s implement cosine anyways, using the trick from my lazy infinite lists post. There are much easier ways to implement cosine in Nix but let’s do it with infinite lists for the fun of it.\n\nAs a warmup, let’s define an infinite list of ones in Nix:\n\nlet ones = [ 1 ] ++ ones; in builtins . elemAt ones 10\n\nAnd now let’s run it!\n\nerror: … while calling the ' elemAt' builtin at « string » : 4 : 3 : 3 | in 4 | builtins . elemAt ones 10 | ^ error: infinite recursion encountered at « string » : 2 : 17 : 1 | let 2 | ones = [ 1 ] ++ ones; | ^ 3 | in\n\nOh no, Nix isn’t very happy! Nix lists actually aren’t the lazy linked lists from Haskell that we know and love, but rather finite arrays. Ugh, arrays! Nix is supposed to be lazy, but apparently ++ computes both its arguments immediately or something? Weird.\n\nLuckily, we can implement our own infinite linked lists as a two-element set with a head representing the first element and tail representing the rest of the list. Now we can define our ones list:\n\nlet take = n: s: if n == 0 then [ ] else [ s . head ] ++ take (n - 1 ) s . tail; ones = { head = 1 ; tail = ones; }; in take 10 ones\n\nThis prints out [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ] , yay! Next, let’s try defining ints :\n\nlet take = n: s: if n == 0 then [ ] else [ s . head ] ++ take (n - 1 ) s . tail; map = f: s: { head = f s . head; tail = map f s . tail; }; ints = { head = 1 ; tail = map ( x:x+1 ) ints; }; in take 10 ints\n\nLet’s run it:\n\n[ 1 « error: attempt to call something which is not a function but a string: \"x:x+1\" » « error: attempt to call something which is not a function but a string: \"x:x+1\" » « error: attempt to call something which is not a function but a string: \"x:x+1\" » « error: attempt to call something which is not a function but a string: \"x:x+1\" » « error: attempt to call something which is not a function but a string: \"x:x+1\" » « error: attempt to call something which is not a function but a string: \"x:x+1\" » « error: attempt to call something which is not a function but a string: \"x:x+1\" » « error: attempt to call something which is not a function but a string: \"x:x+1\" » « error: attempt to call something which is not a function but a string: \"x:x+1\" » ]\n\nKublai: Ugh… what the heck?\n\nSHL: For lambda functions in Nix, you have to add a space after the : . Otherwise, it’s interpreted as a string.\n\nA… string? Even though there aren’t even any quotes? What? Weird. Anyways, the correct code is tail = map (x: x+1) ints; .\n\nWhatever. Now we can port over all the Haskell/Python code from my previous post:\n\nlet pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { }; take = n: s: if n == 0 then [ ] else [ s . head ] ++ take (n - 1 ) s . tail; map = f: s: { head = f s . head; tail = map f s . tail; }; zipWith = f: s1: s2: { head = f s1 . head s2 . head; tail = zipWith f s1 . tail s2 . tail; }; ints = { head = 1 ; tail = map (x: x + 1 ) ints; }; integrate = s: c: { head = c; tail = zipWith (a: b: a / b) s ints; }; expSeries = integrate expSeries 1 .0 ; sine = integrate cosine 0 .0 ; cosine = map (x: - x) (integrate sine -1 .0 ); evalAt = n: s: x: pkgs . lib . lists . foldr (a: acc: a + acc * x) 0 (take n s); in { intsExample = take 10 ints; expSeriesExample = take 10 expSeries; sineExample = take 10 sine; cosineExample = take 10 cosine; expAt2 = evalAt 100 expSeries 2 ; cosineAt2 = evalAt 100 cosine 2 ; }\n\nNow let’s run it with nix eval --file main.nix :\n\n{ cosineAt2 = « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» ; cosineExample = [ « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» ]; expAt2 = 7 .38906 ; expSeriesExample = [ 1 1 0 .5 0 .166667 0 .0416667 0 .00833333 0 .00138889 0 .000198413 2 .48016e-05 2 .75573e-06 ]; intsExample = [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ]; sineExample = [ 0 « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» « error: expected a float but found a function: « lambda integrate @ /home/a/main.nix : 23 : 18 »» ]; }\n\nKublai: Ah shoot Nix is screaming at us again!\n\nSHL: This time the culprit is -1.0 which is interpreted as a function. We need to wrap it with parenthesis and do cosine = map (x: -x) (integrate sine (-1.0)); to tell Nix that it’s a float.\n\nWhat? That makes no sense either. Anyways, let’s try running the fixed version:\n\n{ cosineAt2 = -0 .416147 ; cosineExample = [ 1 0 -0 .5 0 0 .0416667 0 -0 .00138889 0 2 .48016e-05 0 ]; expAt2 = 7 .38906 ; expSeriesExample = [ 1 1 0 .5 0 .166667 0 .0416667 0 .00833333 0 .00138889 0 .000198413 2 .48016e-05 2 .75573e-06 ]; intsExample = [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ]; sineExample = [ 0 1 0 -0 .166667 0 0 .00833333 0 -0 .000198413 0 2 .75573e-06 ]; }\n\nLooks like it finally works! Hooray! As simple as that. Next time, don’t rewrite it in Rust. Rewrite it in everyone’s favorite general-purpose language, Nix. You won’t regret it!\n\nKublai: Welp I kinda forgot what I wanted to use cosine for in my configuration.nix in the first place…\n\nRandom cool Nix stuff\n\nIf you’d like to read some slightly less cursed Nix stuff, here are some great articles.\n\nOverlays use fixed points: https://nixcademy.com/posts/what-you-need-to-know-about-laziness/ https://blog.layus.be/posts/2020-06-12-nix-overlays.html\n\nIt seems weird that the Nix store is input-addressed rather than content-addressed but apparently content addressing is just really hard: https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-09-10-nix-cas/ https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-11-18-nix-cas-self-references/ https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-02-17-derivation-outputs-and-output-paths/ https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-12-02-nix-cas-4/\n\nOh and also Btrfs is awesome! When I switched my main laptop to NixOS, I simply installed it onto a new subvolume, no live USB needed.\n\nAnd lastly, thanks Ersei for answering all my silly Nix and NixOS questions!"}

They’ve come in clutch for everything from early morning runs on busy roads to long train rides when I want to catch up on a podcast but still be able to talk to friends traveling with me. I have no hesitations about recommending a pair to someone looking to try bone-conduction headphones. And yet, my favorite thing about them is also their greatest weakness — they don’t block any outside noise.\n\nSo, when the gas company came down my street, ripping up a strip of pavement in the name of maintenance, I thought I would lose my mind. I couldn’t escape the sound of jackhammering or the feeling of my entire apartment shaking, at least not with my favorite ‘buds in my ears. In a moment of desperation, I dusted off a pair of CMF Buds Pro 2 that I hadn’t used in a few months, and now I wish I’d been using them all along. Here’s why.\n\nGood fit, great controls\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nAt a glance, there’s very little to get excited about with the CMF Buds Pro 2 — at least from a design perspective. They’re a simple, in my case, white pair of true wireless earbuds that look like AirPods but not quite. You know, just like almost every other pair of ‘buds on the market. Yet, when you’re paying just a shade under $60 for earbuds you can grab and go, that’s all you need. Besides, how they fit and how easy they are to control is much more important.\n\nAnd, on both fronts, the CMF Buds Pro 2 delivered. I mean, there’s a reason that so many earbuds look like Apple’s signature AirPods these days, and it’s because the design just works. As long as you have rubber ear tips and a round enough body, it’s easy to nestle them comfortably in your ears. So, when I slipped the Buds Pro 2 from their case and popped them in, I got a little bit lucky that I didn’t have to swap tip sizes — they just fit from the get-go. If you need to swap ear tips, Nothing includes small, medium, and large sizes in its packaging, and there’s also a fit test to ensure you get the right pair.\n\nThey look like AirPods and feel like AirPods, but I don't mind one bit.\n\nAnyway, the more exciting piece of the CMF Buds Pro 2 design for me was controlling my music once I had the earbuds in. With the amount of roadwork going on outside, the last thing I wanted to do was fidget with either earbud and throw off its in-ear detection, exposing me to the sounds of jackhammering once again. So, I was relieved to find out there’s a better way to control the earbuds than tapping on either stem. Sure, you can do that, but you can also do everything with the Smart Dial built into the earbuds’ charging case. You can press it to start and stop your music, hold it to change your noise canceling settings, or twist it to adjust your playback volume — it’s kind of like a fidget toy, but it serves a purpose beyond combating boredom.\n\nIt’s also at this point that my friends over at SoundGuys would probably tell you every last detail about how the CMF Buds Pro 2 sound and how close their profile is to perfection (you can read their in-depth thoughts here). I, however, am not nearly that much of a headphone geek — my favorite headphones don’t even go in my ears — so I will just say that I quite like the sound that comes out of these budget-friendly ‘buds. I have them paired to my Nothing Phone 3a, and I’ve been using the Nothing X app to tailor my preferences, letting Dirac Opteo take the wheel as far as adjusting my equalizer, and I have no real complaints.\n\nNow, if only these cheap earbuds could reduce the vibration rattling through my apartment. Maybe I need Nothing’s wired earbuds from April Fool’s Day for that.\n\nNoise canceling that gets the job done\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nHonestly, though, the real reason I turned to Nothing’s CMF Buds Pro 2 to find peace during the involuntary stretch of roadwork is simple — I needed noise canceling more than anything. And yes, I’ve had plenty of earbuds that have offered noise cancelation in the past, like the Google Pixel Buds Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, but I’ve since sent both off to other colleagues, largely because I found myself using my trusty OpenRun Pro most of the time anyway. So, before I knew it, the CMF Buds Pro 2 were all I had left.\n\nThankfully, they also turned out to be all I needed. Maybe the cancellation isn’t perfect (or at least it doesn’t match some of the most expensive earbuds on the market), but knocking out 50dB of jackhammering sound was enough for me to focus on my articles for the day. The CMF Buds Pro 2 also support adaptive ANC, which adjusts for the sounds around you and can let conversations through the filter, but my cats haven’t learned to speak English yet, so I kept the cancelation set to its highest level instead.\n\nIt's not perfect, but this noise canceling is worth way more than $60.\n\nHowever, just because the CMF Buds Pro 2 do many good things for under $60 doesn’t mean they’re perfect. I’ve occasionally noticed that they’ll just stop playing in my ears, or the adaptive ANC will fluctuate too quickly, dropping to let a conversation in or cutting off half of a sentence. Also, while I can usually get a good fit from my workout earbuds, and I trust the IP55 rating when I’m in the gym, the glossy plastic sometimes gets a bit slippery when I start to sweat — a problem I’ve never had with bone conduction headphones.\n\nI never expected it, but I owe my local gas company a word of thanks. If not for its roadwork that starts at 8:00 sharp every morning, I wouldn’t have touched my CMF Buds Pro 2 until Nothing released another ultra-affordable Android phone. Now, I have a new favorite pair of grab-and-go earbuds, and I’m almost willing to drop my own money on a pair of Nothing Ear 3 ($149 at Amazon) just to see how they compare. By the way, I’m not entirely abandoning my beloved Shokz, I’m just going to save them for the times I need to keep my ears free.\n\nCMF Buds Pro 2 CMF Buds Pro 2 Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation • Affordable • Comfortable MSRP: $59.00 The CMF Buds Pro 2 is an impressive yet affordable set of earbuds, The CMF Buds Pro 2 boasts impressive noise canceling, an IP-55 rating, and a robust carry case at a $59 price point that won't break the bank.

Here’s a simple way to find out", "fullContent": "If you’re a smartphone owner—and chances are that’s everyone reading this—you’ve probably encountered an eerie, but all too common scenario: One day you’re talking about a random topic while your phone is next to you and the following day you notice ads start popping up related to that same topic. It’s unsettling. How do these ads know what you were talking about?\n\nYour smartphone may be the culprit. Every smartphone has its built-in microphone constantly turned on in order for the virtual assistant to hear your voice commands. So, could it be that these devices are also secretly eavesdropping on your conversations in order to serve you ads? Here’s everything you need to know, plus a simple test to find out.\n\nHow to find out if your phone is listening to you\n\nTo test if your phone is listening to your conversations, start by openly discussing a unique topic that you’ve never searched for or discussed previously while your phone is turned on next to you. It’s crucial that this be something that isn’t related to your usual interests or search queries.\n\nSpend a day or two discussing this topic out loud with your phone next to you the whole time. Make sure that you don’t search about this topic on any of your devices—not just your phone.\n\nYou can also try talking about specific things related to this topic. For example, if you’re discussing traveling to Spain, you can discuss learning Spanish or what the best restaurant is for paella in Madrid.\n\nDuring this time, pay close attention to the ads you’re served while online—ads on social media feeds, websites you visit, apps you use, and those on your smart TV if you have one. Then, if you begin seeing ads about the topic you chose to discuss, chances are you’ve confirmed the eavesdropping and caught your phone red-handed.\n\nWhat to do if you think your phone is eavesdropping\n\nBefore you go taping over the microphone and camera on your phone or throwing it in a lake, there are a few less drastic things you can do to curb the potential eavesdropping.\n\nThe first is to carefully review the app permissions on your device. It’s likely that you downloaded an app and allowed it to access your microphone without ever realizing it. Comb through the permissions for each app on your phone and limit apps that don’t need access to your microphone, camera, or location settings.\n\nUnder the respective settings menus, you can turn off Google Assistant on Android phones or Siri on iOS devices to make sure they aren’t eavesdropping. Sam Singleton\n\nNext, clear the voice history and disable your phone’s digital assistant. Google, Siri, and Alexa are all very convenient, but might be actively (and passively) recording everything you say without you knowing.\n\nJust last year, 404 Media reported that a third-party company named Cox Media Group (CMG), which offers “Active Listening” technology, was working with companies such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.\n\nWhile these companies have since denied using this technology to spy on phone users, the fact is that the capabilities exist and it’d be foolish to assume that companies wouldn’t take advantage of ways to more effectively advertise to consumers—after all, ads drive most of their revenue.\n\nFinally, while companies are the most likely source of eavesdropping, there is always the potential for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities on your device and take control of the microphone or camera as well. The best way to combat this is to make sure you always have the latest updates for both your phone’s OS and all of the installed apps.\n\nAll of these steps will help cut off unwanted access to your phone’s microphone, but if you’re still unsure, there’s a simple solution. Just turn off your phone or leave it behind when you want to discuss private matters. It’s the best way to ensure your phone can’t hear you.\n\nIf your phone isn’t listening, then how’s it getting your data?\n\nWhile the prospect of your phone constantly eavesdropping on your every conversation may be disconcerting, there are myriad ways that you could be divulging this same info without ever saying it out loud.\n\nEach smartphone is a veritable treasure trove of personal data for any and all apps to pull from. They are essentially mini-computers packed with sensors: gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, and just about any other -meter you can think of. The data collected from these sensors can provide a shocking amount of info about our routines, habits, and personalities.\n\nEverywhere you visit, other people you talk to or spend time with, lifestyle choices, and personal health data are just some of the metadata and telemetry—phone sensor data—collected by your phone. Not to mention all of the vast amounts of data you’ve already provided over the years to your apps and via Google searches.\n\nYour phone and the installed apps hoover up all of this data and send it off to third parties such as data brokers to be analyzed, sold, and regurgitated back to you in the form of personalized ads.\n\nSo, even though you may not have talked about or searched that trip to Spain, your phone may have intuited what you were thinking and come to the conclusion on its own based on the data it collected. Maybe your friends were searching for Spanish AirBnBs while next to you, or maybe you downloaded Duolingo and started learning Spanish recently, or maybe your shopping trends show a recent uptick in the amount of saffron and jamón you’ve been buying.\n\nAny and all of this metadata could be the reasoning for the eerily relevant ads you’re seeing. And while your phone could truly be listening in, it might just be the unspoken data you’re sharing in other ways that gives you away."}

With a crisp assist for Luis Díaz during Liverpool’s 2-1 win over West Ham United at Anfield, Salah reached an unprecedented 45 goal involvements this Premier League season — 27 goals and 18 assists — the most ever recorded in a standard 38-game campaign.\n\nIt’s a figure that doesn’t just place him atop the charts, but also redefines the boundaries of what is possible in England’s top flight. Not since Kevin De Bruyne’s masterful 20-assist haul in the 2019-20 season has anyone come close to Salah’s current creative output. Yet what sets Salah apart is not merely the numbers, but the consistency and decisiveness of his contributions.\n\nSalah’s Form Drives Liverpool’s Premier League Push\n\nThere’s a sense that Salah’s influence at Liverpool is no longer up for debate — if it ever truly was. Week in, week out, he delivers. Whether drifting inside to finish from improbable angles or carving open defences with vision and precision, the Egyptian international remains the side’s most potent threat.\n\nFor new manager Arne Slot, who stepped in following Jürgen Klopp’s departure last May, Salah has been a constant in a season of transition. In a squad adapting to subtle tactical shifts and the fresh dynamics of leadership, Salah has not merely adapted — he has thrived.\n\nThe forward’s enduring value lies in his ability to turn tight games in Liverpool’s favour, like he did again on Sunday. His assist to Díaz wasn’t just another statistic — it was a moment that set the tone for a vital Premier League win.\n\nPremier League Legacy Cemented\n\nIf there were still any lingering questions about Salah’s place in Premier League history, this latest record answers them. The modern game may be full of short-term narratives, but Salah’s achievements demand longevity in memory.\n\nTo score 27 goals in a single league season is noteworthy in itself. To add 18 assists on top of that speaks to a player whose game has evolved — who has refined his intelligence and efficiency to devastating effect.\n\nMore Than Just Numbers\n\nBeyond the records and stats, Salah’s performances this season reflect a player operating at the peak of his powers. He has become both finisher and creator, a hybrid of clinical forward and visionary playmaker. “The assist for Luis Diaz’s opening strike” was just the latest example of his all-encompassing game.\n\nAt 32, Salah is showing no signs of decline. Instead, he continues to be the heartbeat of Liverpool’s Premier League ambitions — a player rewriting records and redefining what elite performance looks like in English football."}

The Brazilian hasn’t featured since Liverpool’s Champions League clash with PSG due to a head injury sustained on international duty. Now cleared following concussion protocols, he’s ready to reclaim his place in goal.\n\nManager Arne Slot confirmed the positive update: Alisson is fit and available, providing a crucial presence at the back as Liverpool look to capitalise on Arsenal’s slip-up against Brentford.\n\nBradley Set for Start After Injury Layoff\n\nConor Bradley is also expected to start at right-back after coming off the bench against Fulham. With both Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez ruled out, Slot had previously turned to Curtis Jones as a makeshift full-back. But Bradley’s return brings balance back to the defensive line.\n\n“Yes, it does. Of course it’s a boost, it’s always a boost when quality players come back,” said Slot. “To have Conor back, I think we all would make the same decision and that’s playing Conor in that position.”\n\nBradley has impressed when called upon this season, and with Trent still unavailable, his presence is vital for Liverpool’s Premier League ambitions.\n\nSalah and Diaz in Attack\n\nMohamed Salah is expected to lead the front line, fresh from signing a new contract that will keep him at the club beyond this season. Luis Diaz is pushing to return to the starting XI, likely replacing Cody Gakpo. There are no new injury concerns ahead of Sunday’s match.\n\nPredicted Liverpool XI vs West Ham\n\nAlisson; Bradley, Konate, Van Dijk, Robertson; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Szoboszlai, Diaz; Jota\n\nKick-off is at 2pm BST on Sunday, April 13, with live coverage on Sky Sports.

A 20th English league title, and the first under head coach Arne Slot, was within reach. The mood at Anfield was focused but electric as West Ham arrived on Merseyside, looking to play the role of spoilers.\n\nSlot, who has managed squad rotation with precision through a demanding season, named a strong and rested starting eleven. His selections reflected both the gravity of the occasion and the lessons learned in recent weeks—intensity was non-negotiable. The Dutchman’s tactical approach has steadily evolved Liverpool’s play this season, and this match offered another test of that maturity: breaking down a compact, counter-attacking side with little to lose.\n\nWest Ham, for their part, showed early signs of resistance, but Liverpool’s energy was clear from the outset. The Reds pressed high, worked intelligently between the lines, and sought to assert dominance quickly. There was little sign of nerves in the opening exchanges, just a sense of sharp, collective focus. The front three looked lively, the midfield tidy and assertive, and the backline, marshalled by a returning senior figure, Alisson Becker, remained composed.\n\nIt wasn’t vintage Liverpool at every moment, but there was a ruthless edge in phases that pointed toward a side intent on finishing the job. What followed was a performance that carried title-winning credentials—and one standout player who drove it all, staking his claim for Man of the Match.\n\nIn a very fine opening thirty minutes, Liverpool was vibrant and industrious, with their talisman, Mohamed Salah, scintillating from his right-wing position. After a good long-range effort drifted wide, the newly re-signed attacker evaded his marker with brilliance, before striding forward and delivering a perfect pinpoint pass for the opening goal. Moments later the former Roma man was again terrorising in his work as he scampered down the wing to show his world-class skills.\n\nUnfortunately for the 32-year-old, his teammates failed to give him service that matched his first-half output, as the Reds showed the strain of being so close to the finish line and the Premier League title. Next up is a visit to Leicester where only two wins are needed to secure the crown.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lfctransferroom/status/1911413685928542627?s=46&t=rxgukmqdoXc4muVFLSx2EQ\n\nSteven Smith’s Pre-match Prediction;\n\nLiverpool 3 – 1 West Ham"}

Today, it’s West Ham standing in their way—and they’ll walk into Anfield knowing full well they’re up against a machine that rarely misfires.\n\nLast week’s blip at Fulham was only Liverpool’s second league loss all season. But let’s be honest: the title is still theirs to lose. Arne Slot’s side have seven matches left, and they only need 11 points. Slip-ups? Not likely. Not with the way they’ve played this campaign.\n\nOne massive boost? Mohamed Salah has just signed a new contract, keeping him at the club until 2027. The Egyptian’s future had been up in the air, but now it’s settled—and that’s big news. “The Egyptian was due to be out of contract in the summer, but he has put pen to paper on a deal that will see him stay at the club until at least the summer of 2027.”\n\nWest Ham’s Away Day Struggles\n\nWest Ham aren’t exactly flying. They’ve picked up just three points from their last four games and lost to Wolves along the way.

Yet, in typical fashion, their captain Virgil van Dijk stood tallest — both literally and metaphorically — to nod in a decisive 89th-minute header and seal a vital 2-1 victory at Anfield.\n\nWith the win, Liverpool moved 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League, needing just six more to mathematically clinch the title. It’s a position earned not through glamour, but grit — and few moments better epitomise that than Van Dijk’s match-winning goal.\n\nSetback Turned Statement\n\nThe game’s defining twist came moments after what might have been a costly mix-up between Van Dijk and Andy Robertson. Miscommunication in the Liverpool back line led to an unfortunate own goal from Robertson, cancelling out Luis Diaz’s composed first-half finish, laid on beautifully by Mohamed Salah with a deft outside-of-the-boot pass.\n\n“I heard him [Robertson] shout but listen, these things unfortunately happen. Obviously there was time to make it right and luckily we did,” Van Dijk told Sky Sports post-match. “We train a lot on it and I try to be important. Finally today I could score the winner. On to the next.”\n\nIt was, in truth, a captain’s intervention in the purest sense. Having made an error, however innocuous, Van Dijk responded not with hesitation but with clarity — climbing above the West Ham defence to guide the ball home and restore order.\n\nHillsborough and the Bigger Picture\n\nThis wasn’t just any victory. The occasion was emotionally charged, taking place on the eve of the Hillsborough anniversary — a solemn and reflective period in the club’s calendar. Van Dijk, captaining his 100th league match for Liverpool, appeared visibly moved.\n\n“I can tell you I’m very proud today to captain my 100th [league] game for Liverpool. It was an emotional day because of the Hillsborough anniversary,” he added. “The main focus was to get three points and get a step closer to all of our dreams – not only us as players and staff but the whole of everyone connected to Liverpool FC. That’s the main thing.”\n\nThis depth of sentiment is not merely symbolic. It’s the connective tissue between club, players, and supporters — a reminder that for Liverpool, moments like these are never just about points; they’re about identity.\n\nWest Ham’s Resistance and Liverpool’s Resolve\n\nIt would be unfair to ignore West Ham United’s contribution to a pulsating encounter. Far from a side rolling over for a title-chasing juggernaut, David Moyes’ men were organised, intelligent, and in the second half, aggressive in their pursuit of an equaliser — which they eventually forced, albeit through fortune.\n\n“It’s a good team, to be fair, they have a good plan,” said Salah. “They managed to play better in the second half and they managed to score.”\n\nBut in the end, it was Liverpool’s resilience — a hallmark of their campaign under new manager Arne Slot — that proved decisive. Salah, whose contract extension was announced earlier this week, summed it up succinctly: “I think in that stage the most important thing is to win the game and we did well in the last few minutes.”\n\nHe added: “We owe the fans one [a league title]. When we won it [in 2019-20] we won it in a lockdown. So, let’s go for it and win it. That’s the most important thing.”\n\nFinal Stretch Beckons for Liverpool\n\nWith six matches remaining, the Premier League crown is within touching distance for Liverpool. Van Dijk’s late heroics against West Ham United were more than just three points — they were a statement of intent, a rallying cry for the final push, and perhaps a defining image of this title run.\n\nThe Kop knows the weight of history. And now, with the finish line in sight, it’s becoming harder to shake the feeling that this Liverpool side — led by their towering Dutchman — is destined to deliver once more."}

Arriving at Anfield with pedigree, flair, and the sheen of a European Championship winner, Chiesa now finds himself edging towards the exit door after what has been an undeniably underwhelming debut season under head coach Arne Slot.\n\nCaughtOffside reports that “Chiesa is emerging as a target for AC Milan, along with three unnamed Premier League clubs,” while Liverpool appear open to offers in the region of €25-30m. The valuation feels both pragmatic and quietly revealing—a tacit admission that this high-profile move simply hasn’t clicked.\n\nChiesa’s Struggles in a Red Shirt\n\nIt’s not been for lack of talent. On his day, Chiesa remains an electrifying winger—direct, technically sharp, capable of turning a game in a moment. But Slot’s system has seemingly never found room for him. The former Juventus star has battled to impose himself on matches, and despite occasional flashes—like a well-taken goal against Newcastle—there’s been no consistent platform for success.\n\nCaughtOffside noted, “Chiesa had been keen to give his time at Liverpool more of a chance, but it now seems very clear that it’s just not working out for the 27-year-old.” It’s an honest, sobering reality that echoes loudly in the terraces. Few signings arrive with such anticipation and depart with such little imprint.\n\nSerie A Return or Premier League Stay?\n\nThere’s little surprise in the suggestion that Serie A giants like AC Milan are ready to welcome Chiesa back to familiar soil. His style—suited to more tactical, possession-focused football—always seemed more at home in Italy than in the Premier League’s frantic chaos.\n\nYet the Premier League interest complicates things. “Sources with a close understanding of the situation have revealed to CaughtOffside that Chiesa is emerging as a target… along with three unnamed Premier League clubs.” For Chiesa, that might offer a final shot at English redemption—albeit outside of the elite-level pressure he’s faced at Anfield.\n\nLiverpool’s Forward Line Leaves No Room for Sentiment\n\nWith Mohamed Salah, Luis Díaz, Diogo Jota, and Cody Gakpo all ahead in the pecking order, Slot simply doesn’t need to keep Chiesa around to make up the numbers. His system values flexibility and pressing from the front, areas where the Italian hasn’t entirely convinced.\n\nCaughtOffside summed it up bluntly: “Slot already has plenty of other options in his attack… so there certainly seems little need to keep hold of Chiesa.” The timing, then, feels right—for both parties. Liverpool can recoup a fair portion of their investment, and Chiesa can restart his career away from the Merseyside spotlight.\n\nNo Ill Will – Just a Mismatch of Styles and Timing\n\nThere’s no sense of bitterness in how this transfer has unravelled. It’s more an issue of chemistry and fit. Chiesa’s qualities remain undisputed, but they haven’t married well with the evolution of Liverpool’s tactical identity under Slot.\n\nFans may feel let down, not because of anything Chiesa has done wrong, but because the potential was so vivid when he arrived. As CaughtOffside note, “Some Reds fans will undoubtedly be disappointed that this deal couldn’t work out, however, as Chiesa looked like an exciting addition when he first joined.”\n\nIn the grander Liverpool tapestry, his name may fade quickly. But there’s still time for a second act—perhaps in red and black in Milan, or under different lights in the Premier League.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThis situation feels like one we’ve seen before. A big-name foreign signing comes in with plenty of promise, but just never finds rhythm within Liverpool’s framework. Under Klopp, perhaps Chiesa might’ve had a clearer brief—a defined role on the counter or in a high-pressing unit. Under Slot, whose structure is arguably more fluid and tactically demanding, Chiesa’s lack of defined purpose stood out.\n\nThe reported €25-30m asking price feels reasonable—enough to preserve value but not enough to deter potential suitors. There’s little appetite for keeping a fifth-choice winger when the club is seeking midfield reinforcements and potentially a Salah replacement in the longer term.\n\nWhile it’s unfortunate things didn’t pan out, there’s no animosity towards Chiesa. Fans are likely to reflect on this as a low-risk, low-reward move that didn’t quite pay off—especially with attackers like Gakpo and Jota ahead of him.\n\nFrom a squad-planning perspective, offloading Chiesa opens up a non-homegrown slot, frees up wages, and gives the club more manoeuvrability in the summer window. In that sense, it’s simply smart business."}

This isn’t just hope anymore—it’s expectation. Liverpool have put themselves in a position where the Premier League title is not a distant dream but a real, looming possibility. And it could all be wrapped up next weekend.\n\nStrong Position After Consistent Form\n\nFrom the first few weeks of the season, something clicked. This wasn’t just another Liverpool campaign. It had grit. It had control. Whether scraping narrow wins or overwhelming opponents, Liverpool have handled their business with the look of champions. Now, as April pushes on, they sit at the top with 73 points from 31 matches.\n\nCompare that to Arsenal—second place, 63 points, but they’ve played a game more. That’s a 10-point gap with Liverpool holding a game in hand. The equation is simple: nine more points from their remaining seven Premier League fixtures, and the title is theirs.\n\nScenario for April 20 Title Win\n\nIt could all be over as early as Saturday, 20 April. Liverpool travel to face Leicester City. But it’s what happens earlier that matters most.\n\nFirst, they need to beat West Ham at Anfield this weekend. That’s step one. Then comes the wildcard: Arsenal must lose to Ipswich on the same day Liverpool take on Leicester. If that happens, Liverpool hit 79 points. Arsenal, stuck on 63, would be unable to catch up—81 being their maximum possible total.\n\nIt’s all in motion. “If Liverpool do their job and Arsenal slip, it’s all over.” That’s not an opinion—it’s a fact.\n\nStill Work to Do If Not\n\nOf course, if Arsenal avoid defeat, things stretch out a little longer. But not much. Liverpool would still be in control, with the chance to finish the job at home against Tottenham on 27 April. That match could become a title party at Anfield—if not a coronation on the road.\n\nFans Dare to Dream\n\nThe vibe has changed. It’s not about asking if anymore. It’s when. The Premier League title is within reach, and Liverpool are showing every sign they’re ready to grab it."}

With an opportunity to extend their lead to 13 points from the second-placed Gunners, the Anfield faithful were full of song as they welcomed the East London outfit with just three wins needed from seven games to guarantee a 20th English League title.\n\nThe lineup and subsequent ratings are listed below.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lfctransferroom/status/1911433105988001842?s=46&t=rxgukmqdoXc4muVFLSx2EQ\n\nAlisson Becker – 8.0\n\nThe giant Brazilian stopper came back into the team following concussion protocol issues, with a desire to bring an elite level back into the home team’s rearguard.

As reported by Fichajes, the Italian international has been pinpointed as the missing link in a reimagined midfield trio alongside Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister. “Liverpool has set its transfer machinery in motion with a clear objective: to strengthen its midfield with a high-profile signing.”\n\nWith over 250 appearances for Inter and more than 60 caps for Italy, Barella brings not just pedigree, but a track record of big-game performances. “Since bursting onto the Italian elite scene, Barella has made his mark with his dynamism, playmaking ability, and goal-scoring prowess.”\n\nWhy Barella Fits the Anfield Profile\n\n\n\nThe profile is ideal: technically sharp, tactically intelligent, and relentlessly driven. He offers traits that Liverpool’s midfield has lacked in certain phases over the last two seasons. “His consistent presence in the Serie A champion’s starting eleven and his experience with the Azzurra—over 60 international caps—make him a valuable option for a club looking to reclaim the spotlight in both England and Europe.”\n\nLiverpool’s sporting hierarchy see this as an opportunity to add a proven winner. “Liverpool’s sporting management believes that his signing would lead to an immediate qualitative leap.”\n\nValuation and Transfer Hurdles Ahead\n\n\n\nHowever, Inter Milan are reportedly unwilling to accept less than €100 million, aware of Barella’s value and irreplaceable status. “Inter, aware of the player’s worth, is not considering letting him go for less than 100 million euros.” That price tag, while hefty, underscores just how much admiration there is for the Sardinian.\n\nSlot’s System Demands This Kind of Midfielder\n\n\n\nIf Slot’s philosophy is to come to life, it will demand tempo, technical precision and leadership from midfield. Barella ticks all three boxes. The real task? Convincing both Inter and the player that this project at Anfield can match the ambitions of a player already established at the top of European football. “The challenge will be to persuade Inter to part ways with one of its pillars and to convince Barella that Anfield represents the logical next step in his career.”\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThere’s every reason for Liverpool fans to feel excited by this potential transfer – and a fair bit cautious too. Barella is not just a technically gifted midfielder; he’s a player who thrives under pressure, capable of dictating the tempo and delivering match-defining moments. He’d be the closest thing to a Steven Gerrard-style figure in terms of influence, if not style. That said, a fee north of €100 million is a major commitment.\n\nIf Liverpool are truly ready to back Arne Slot with such a signing, it’s a firm statement of intent. Yet there’s reason to question whether Inter would even entertain such a deal. Barella is not just a player – he’s a symbol of their resurgence.\n\nStill, Liverpool fans will take heart from the idea of a midfield with Gravenberch’s dynamism, Mac Allister’s composure, and Barella’s bite and flair. That’s a trio that could dominate the Premier League and punch deep into Europe. The key? Moving fast and decisively – because if this drags on, others will circle.\n\nIn short: believe in the vision, but don’t hold your breath just yet. This one could go the distance."}

The 28-year-old Frenchman has emerged as Bayern’s “number one sales candidate” this summer, as the club seeks to reshape its squad and generate funds.\n\n“Liverpool are actually interested in him,” Falk confirmed. “Coman is on the shortlist. It’s not to the point where there are negotiations or offers yet, but they’re monitoring his situation, especially after he’s Bayern’s number one sales candidate. Not because they don’t appreciate him, but because they can see him bringing in money.”\n\nDespite being contracted until 2027, Coman’s future in Munich looks uncertain. Vincent Kompany hasn’t relied on him heavily, and persistent injury concerns have limited his availability – issues Liverpool are said to be wary of.\n\nVersatility and pace make Coman a tempting fit\n\nFalk was clear on why Liverpool, and others, are circling: “Yes, of course that’s one of the considerations,” he said of Coman’s injury history. “But of course, with his high speed, he would fit in really well. He comes in on the left, but he can actually play all of them. So that would be interesting for the team.”\n\nThat versatility is a key point. Coman could provide competition across Liverpool’s front line, notably as an alternative or eventual successor to Luis Díaz, while also being capable of deputising on the right if needed – potentially easing the burden on Mo Salah, despite the Egyptian’s recent contract extension.\n\nPremier League interest heating up\n\nComan isn’t just a Liverpool target. Arsenal and Tottenham are also believed to be interested. Florian Plettenberg reports that Arsenal may turn their attention to Coman after failing to land Leroy Sane. Spurs are similarly monitoring the situation, hoping to capitalise on Bayern’s willingness to sell.\n\nThe fee could be relatively modest given Coman’s pedigree – previous reports suggest he could be available for as little as €30m (£26m). That price point might be attractive for Liverpool, especially if the club views him as a strategic addition under new head coach Arne Slot.\n\nWages and injury record complicate things\n\nHowever, concerns persist – and they’re valid. Coman has battled multiple muscular injuries across his career. This, combined with reportedly high wages, creates a natural hesitation. For a player who hasn’t hit consistent form in recent seasons, Liverpool’s recruitment team will need to weigh risk versus reward carefully.\n\nStill, with Bayern reportedly prioritising his sale – and Coman himself said to be open to a move for regular playing time – the pieces may yet fall into place.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor all his flair, there’s a reason Bayern are happy to cash in on Kingsley Coman. And while it’s tempting to think of him bombing down the wing at Anfield, it’s hard not to feel sceptical.\n\nFirstly, his injury record is a red flag. We’ve been burned before by signing players with poor availability. Just ask anyone who remembers Naby Keita’s stop-start Liverpool career. Coman’s numbers are solid – 69 goals and 69 assists in 328 games – but that’s over eight years. In a league as intense as the Premier League, can he stay fit long enough to justify the investment?\n\nSecondly, his wages are rumoured to be sky-high. If he’s expecting top-tier wages, you’d imagine Liverpool will hesitate, especially with Salah still at the club and demanding the top bracket. Coman might fit the system, but he doesn’t fit the financial profile we’ve seen under FSG – even with Slot potentially seeking a different attacking balance.\n\nYes, his talent is real. Yes, his Champions League-winning pedigree is attractive. But at 28, with injury doubts and salary demands, this could turn into another risky roll of the dice. If this is a genuine option, Liverpool fans have every right to be cautious."}

As Rousing The Kop report, “Liverpool are working to make progress on three more new contracts after sealing the futures of Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk.” Salah’s extension was confirmed on Friday, keeping him at Anfield for at least two more years, with an option to stretch that to 2028. Van Dijk is next in line, with his signing expected imminently.\n\nThat means the Reds have already tied down both their captain and top scorer – two foundational pieces for the Arne Slot era.\n\nContract Talks Shift to Konate, Bradley and Jones\n\nThe next names on the priority list? “Liverpool are now set to focus on securing new deals for Ibrahima Konate, Conor Bradley and Curtis Jones.” Konate is the most urgent, with his current contract running until 2026. The Frenchman is believed to be seeking a pay rise, but according to RTK, Liverpool remain “positive over the centre-back extending his contract”, expecting a resolution this summer.\n\nBradley and Jones, both academy products, also have two years remaining. The club expects “progress over the coming months”, and there’s internal confidence that all three will commit to longer stays.\n\nMore Contracts in the Spotlight\n\nIt’s not just the current trio of focus. RTK also notes that “the prospect of a new contract for Luis Diaz has not yet been ruled out.” With several players seeing deals expire in 2026 and 2027 – including Alisson, Gomez, Elliott and Tsimikas – Liverpool’s contract strategy appears to be stepping up in scale and urgency.\n\nWhile major focus has been on the high-profile names, the club must also navigate exits. Backup keepers Vitezslav Jaros and Harvey Davies are expected to leave this summer. That trims the squad’s depth but also gives the club some flexibility in reshaping the roster for Slot’s vision.\n\nPlanning for the Future Under Slot\n\nThis proactive stance reflects Liverpool’s intention to secure stability amidst managerial transition. With Jurgen Klopp’s era closed and Arne Slot stepping in, continuity among key players becomes even more vital. Keeping hold of players like Konate, who is entering his prime, or nurturing talents like Bradley and Jones, gives the club both short-term strength and long-term value.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThe club could easily have slipped into a reactive mode post-Klopp, but this approach shows direction. Salah staying until 2028 – possibly – sends a huge message. He’s still delivering, and the fact he’s chosen to remain gives fans confidence in the project ahead.\n\nKonate, in particular, is a must-keep. He’s got the blend of aggression and calm that we’ve needed at the back, and his age profile means he could lead that line for years. If it takes a pay bump to secure him, so be it. Let’s not mess around like we did in the past with key defenders.\n\nAs for Jones and Bradley – this is smart. Both are homegrown, understand the club, and have developed well. Jones showed he can dominate midfield spells, and Bradley looks more and more like a proper first-team option at right-back.\n\nThere’s a buzz around locking players in early. It avoids drama, shows respect, and lets Slot build with clarity. If Diaz is next, even better – he’s only just getting into rhythm. The idea of a settled core, heading into a new chapter, is exactly what we needed."}

A golf shop bought ads in golf magazines or the golf section of the phone book.\n\nFast forward to 2025, and artificial intelligence tools capable of analyzing huge stores of consumer data have upended ad targeting. An entire advertising infrastructure can now target specific shoppers, not just related content, based on their browsing and purchasing habits.\n\nGolf ads might appear on a news site or next to an unrelated social media post because targeting has shifted from context to people.\n\nSuch personalized ads typically produce better results and are preferred by consumers, who now see messages that interest them.\n\nPersonal Privacy\n\nTargeting individuals, however, has a downside. Attempts to understand personal preferences, affinities, and behaviors lead to serious privacy concerns.\n\nTake Google’s My Ad Center, for example. It shows the topics Google associates with a given person and lists several recent ads and brands.\n\nCertainly Google complies with privacy regulations. Yet consumers are often surprised by how much of their online activities are public.\n\nIn a sense, the advertising industry overreached. Regulators responded with legislation such as the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\n\nTwo recent lawsuits against The Trade Desk, a “demand side” platform for advertisers, claim the company’s universal identification technology (UID2) is an invasion of personal privacy and violates the CCPA. Ironically, replacing third-party tracking cookies was a benefit of UID2.\n\nBetter Context\n\nPerhaps recognizing the privacy risks of targeting individuals, several ad tech companies have revisited content.\n\nA golf shop once advertised putters in golf magazines, targeting golfers generally.\n\nNow, an ad platform might scan a specific article on a golf site about, say, 10 ways to improve putting. To some degree, the platform understands the context and displays an ad for a new putter. The targeting is content-level — putter ads on putter articles.\n\nGoogle does this with at least two of its ad types: Contextual targeting for its display ad network and AdSense’s related search for content that analyzes a page and generates links to Google Search for related queries. Both technologies match words.\n\nBut the concept could go further. A new startup, AdZen, does more than word matching. It understands the intent of an article and inserts in-line native ad links.\n\nAn article about how professional golfers play the most difficult greens at the Augusta National Golf Club represents a different level of buying intent and interest than an article on improving putting. Both mention the word putter and putting, but the latter article gets a putter ad, while the former receives an offer for a premium subscription to the Golf Channel.\n\nThis is intent-level contextual targeting. It is more specific than putter ads in putter articles. For advertisers, it may also be as effective as targeting individuals.\n\nEasier Ads\n\nGoogle and AdZen are not the only examples. Dozens of companies are trying to use AI to improve contextual targeting.\n\nThe result could be contextual ads that are easier for advertisers.\n\nFor individually targeted ads, marketers collect data about shoppers, parsing demographics, psychographics, and behavioral data, all to build audiences. Some audiences are for retargeting. Some are for suppression. And some are lookalike audiences to attract new customers.\n\nIn theory, AI-driven contextual targeting does not need any of this data. It shows an ad based on what engages a prospect at that very moment.\n\nInstead of building audiences, marketers would build detailed descriptions of their products and how to use them. The more the AI knows about the item’s features and benefits, the better it will target.\n\nPerhaps best of all, it needs no personally identifiable information.\n\nPII Again\n\nBut “needing” and “using” are different. As privacy rules and regulations evolve, ad tech companies could blend AI-driven contextual targeting with personalization.\n\nThe combination could place the best message in front of a high-intent shopper in a more privacy-safe way."}

I spent countless hours preparing release articles, and a handful of watches stuck with me. In my view, these are the best Watches and Wonders 2025 releases. Just like last year, I picked a Cartier. Unlike last year, however, my other two favorites are from Parmigiani and Angelus.\n\nI pondered whether to put the Rolex Land-Dweller on my list. I love the case and bracelet, and the new caliber is also impressive. Unfortunately, I feel the dials are so off-putting that I would never aspire to own one. That means it could not get more than an honorable mention here. So, with that out of the way, let’s explore my picks for the best Watches and Wonders 2025 releases.\n\nThe best Watches and Wonders 2025 releases — Pick #1: Cartier Tank à Guichets\n\nMy first pick for the best Watches and Wonders 2025 releases is from Cartier. Last year, my show favorite was the Tortue Monopoussoir (a returning theme, but more on that later). This year, it is the Tank à Guichets. This rectangular precious metal watch with its two little peepholes might not be for everyone, but I love it.\n\nI have always loved Cartier for its very specific design language. The watches tend to be elegant but without coming across as dainty. This is due to the unique Parisian style from just after the turn of the 20th century. The house pairs elegance with a certain industrial touch. The Tank à Guichets is perhaps the best example of this combination. I find it ugly and painstakingly beautiful at the same time. That type of tension is usually a sign of great design.\n\nMy pick of the bunch would be the version in yellow gold with its subtle green numerals. I would not kick the platinum version with its touch of red out of my safe either. At a mere 6mm thick and with the crown at 12, these should wear about as comfortably as one can desire. Additionally, the Tank à Guichets makes a bold statement in the ocean of round watches.\n\nThe best Watches and Wonders 2025 releases — Pick #2: Parmigiani Fleurier Tonda PF GMT Rattrapante Verzasca\n\nParmigiani came out with all guns blazing this year. Honestly, any of its new watches could qualify as the best Watches and Wonders 2025 releases in my book. The ultra-clean perpetual calendar and the skeletonized Tonda tickle my fancy just as much. However, I have chosen the watch that resonates with me on a conceptual level — the Tonda PF GMT Rattrapante.\n\nIn case you missed it, the Tonda PF GMT Rattrapante stacks a local-time hour hand over the home-time hour hand. As you cross time zones, a click of the pusher advances the local time, while a lower rose gold hand sticks with your home time. Once you arrive back home, another push of a second pusher resets the hands to home time. In this state, the watch looks like a two-hander.\n\nI love this approach to complications. The house seems determined to make complications look less complicated. It is the ultimate flex if you ask me. The new Verzasca green dial also looks right at home. I love the freshness it provides without sacrificing versatility.\n\nThe best Watches and Wonders 2025 releases — Pick #3: Angelus Chronographe Télémètre Steel Rose\n\nNow, if you follow my writing, you know I suffer from retro fatigue. I don’t mind the occasional nod to history, but straight-up retro watches tend to feel gimmicky and irrelevant in 2025. My final pick for the best Watches and Wonders 2025 releases proves me wrong. Or, at least, it proves that a retro watch can still be great. This is the Angelus Chronographe Télémètre Steel Rose.\n\nAfter last year’s Tortue, I have another monopusher chronograph in my selection for this year. This time, however, it is the deliciously vintage-looking Angelus Chronographe. Measuring in at a period-perfect 37mm, it has the size to match the mid-century inspiration. The monopusher chronograph caliber is based on a very attractive La Joux-Perret movement, proudly on display behind a sapphire window on the back.\n\nI particularly love the salmon-dial variant. It puts the oddly tightly spaced sub-dials front and center. Unfortunately, Angelus is producing only 25 of these, so the chances of scoring one are slim. I would happily wear it, though! It easily makes my list of the best Watches and Wonders 2025 releases.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nThere you have it — my picks for the best Watches and Wonders 2025 releases. Another honorable mention goes to Patek Philippe for the Calatrava ref. 6196P-001, another salmon-dial contender. I would also like to mention the mind-blowing Vacheron Constantin Solaria Ultra Grand Complication as a favorite. Lastly, the A. Lange & Söhne Odysseus in Honeygold surely deserves a shoutout.\n\nAll in all, I feel there was plenty to like at this year’s Watches and Wonders. My picks for the best Watches and Wonders 2025 releases are merely the tip of the iceberg. The one brand that failed to impress me was Tudor. Its releases felt iterative and uninspired. I hope the folks there come up with more innovative stuff next year or perhaps later this year. It is about time we see something new rather than more versions of its existing models.\n\nWhat were your favorite watches of this year’s Watches and Wonders? Let us know in the comments below!"}

While most of his creations so far have centered around Salem, for his latest build, Jeff travels south to New Orleans, another American city brimming with haunted history. Like his New England builds, Jeff bases his model on a real-world location, in this case an iconic corner building on Royal Street that was home to the legendary Jacques St Germain, the French Quarter vampire!\n\nJeff’s models are always best experienced via narrated tour of history and build process on his Spooky Brixx YouTube channel, which you can watch here. Or skip down to a photo gallery for more pics of this haunted masterpiece.\n\nIn past builds, Jeff has stuck to exteriors only because those buildings had few and tiny windows, often obscured by stained glass lighting effects. As the Vampire house has so many windows (a bit ironic!), this time Jeff included a few vignettes that are visibile behind “glass,” such as this gallery. Jeff focused on interior vignettes Thst can be best appreciated through the windows, as his models aren’t designed to come apart like modulars. This view also gives a peek at how the arches over the larger windows were constructed by clipping onto a bent bar. Under each stack of window pannels, Jeff adds a crate for extra texture.\n\nThe building’s backside is less ornate but doesn’t skimp on textured brickwork. Plenty of spooky accessories set the mood for blood-sucking debauchery.\n\nA higher angle is helpful for appreciating the distinctive wide balacony associated with the district. The roof is made from an enviable number of roof tiles and a smattering of bats.\n\nRunning along the balony is Count Jacques himself, chasing a would-be victim. According to local legend, a woman threw herself from the balcony and was found with bite marks in her neck. Police searched the building and found bottles of blood but Jacques St. Germain had disappeared! From this vantage we can also appreciate the lovely iron railing\n\nAt street level, a visiting Orlock-inspired guest drops by. As always, Jeff kills it with the atmospheric lighting.\n\nPeeking through this window we can glimpse another vampire enjoying a releaxing bath. Perhaps it’s Elizabeth Bathory, here to try out the local beignets and blood.\n\nJeff teases that this is but the first of hopefully many French Quarter builds. Can we expect a LEGO Marie Laveau in our future?\n\nRelated"}

Speaking on his podcast-style reaction from the press box, Lynch offered sharp insight into what this win means for Liverpool’s title charge, who shone under pressure, and where improvements are still needed. Here are his five key takeaways from a game that kept fans on the edge of their seats.\n\nFirst-Half Control Showed Liverpool’s Quality\n\nLynch was impressed with the Reds’ opening half, stating, “I think the first half… was one of the best they’ve played for a while really. I thought they were popping it around, they looked really dangerous.” With Luis Díaz opening the scoring, it seemed Liverpool might enjoy a more comfortable afternoon. The stats backed up the dominance: “Liverpool chalked up 1.26 expected goals in that first half, and West Ham just 0.36.”\n\nAtmosphere and Jeopardy Go Hand in Hand\n\nWhile the first half performance was assertive, Lynch acknowledged a significant dip after the break: “Liverpool not anywhere close to the first half level of performance… couldn’t get the second goal, didn’t really threaten.” However, he observed how the late drama reinvigorated both crowd and players: “Once the equaliser goes in, it kind of changes things… Anfield absolutely ramped up from that moment.”\n\nThat electricity culminated in Virgil van Dijk’s towering 89th-minute header, about which Lynch said, “He rises highest to nod that one in and the place absolutely erupts.”\n\nAlisson Becker and Alexis Mac Allister Stand Tall\n\nDespite Van Dijk’s headline-grabbing winner, Lynch made a point to praise Alisson Becker: “Liverpool would not win the game today if it weren’t for some of the saves he pulls out in the most difficult moments.”\n\nIn midfield, Alexis Mac Allister’s contribution was immense. Lynch was glowing: “I just think he’s Liverpool’s best midfielder for me and he has been all season… a world-class player really.” Citing his six ground duels won, four shots, and two chances created—including the match-winning corner—Lynch underlined Mac Allister’s complete performance: “A big, big clutch moment he delivers in.”\n\nArne Slot’s Substitutions Didn’t Hit the Mark\n\nIn a rare critique of Arne Slot, Lynch reflected on the tactical changes that nearly derailed Liverpool’s rhythm. “One of the rare games this season where Slot’s subs haven’t quite worked for him,” he noted, singling out the decision to replace Conor Bradley with Jarell Quansah at right-back.\n\nHe explained: “Quansah… absolutely emptied it to no one under zero pressure. It just shows you, Conor Bradley would have kept possession.” Lynch concluded, “That one put Liverpool under pressure when they didn’t need to be.”\n\nCharacter Over Style as Liverpool Close in on the Title\n\nWhile some may criticise Liverpool’s second-half stumbles, Lynch offered perspective: “At this point of the season, it’s all about just getting over the line.” With the Reds now “13 points clear,” he urged fans to savour the moment, even if performances aren’t always fluent.\n\n“If you want to accuse Liverpool of limping over the line… just think that there are 19 other teams who absolutely wish they were in Liverpool’s position.”\n\nAs the final whistle blew, the message was clear: results matter most in the business end of a title race, and Liverpool, led by Slot, have both the talent and tenacity to finish the job."}

United States Navy Capt. Sean P. Barbabella took note of Trump’s “active lifestyle” in the memo sent to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. (RELATED: Bill Maher Says His Dinner With Trump Showed ‘Why The Democrats Are So Unpopular’)\n\n“President Trump’s days include multiple meetings, public appearances, press availability and frequent victories in golf events,” Barbabella wrote in the memo.\n\nAccording to the memo, Trump weighed 224 pounds, and had a blood pressure of 128/74, with a resting pulse of 62 while scoring 30 out of a possible 30 on a cognitive test. The memo noted a scar from the July 13, 2024, assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, during which Trump’s right ear was grazed by a bullet and “benign lesions” on his skin.\n\nThe memo also listed that Trump was taking two medications to control cholesterol, a cream for a skin condition and aspirin as a preventative measure.\n\n“President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander in Chief and Head of State,” Barbabella wrote. The physical was the first for Trump since he started his second term after succeeding President Joe Biden, whose health and cognitive abilities were widely questioned.\n\nA Wall Street Journal article published Dec. 19, 2024, revealed White House aides “insulated” then-President Joe Biden, even from Cabinet members, as his health declined. The WSJ published similar articles prior to Biden’s July 21, 2024, decision to withdraw from the race, which generated pushback from some other media outlets.\n\nQuestions were also raised about the White House’s truthfulness about Biden’s health. On multiple occasions, Biden said he spoke with people who had died, including claiming to have spoken with former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died in 2017, and former French President Francois Mitterrand, who passed away in 1996 on two occasions in February.\n\nIn September 2022, Biden asked for Republican Rep. Jackie Walorski of Indiana at a conference on hunger that took place several weeks after Walorski and two staffers were killed in a car accident. (Click Here To Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)\n\nBiden also suffered multiple falls during his term in office, including one at the Air Force Academy in June 2023, a fall while on his bike in June 2022 and tripping on the steps of Air Force One on multiple occasions. Biden took a different set of stairs onto the VC-25, a modified Boeing 747 used as Air Force One, among other concessions to his age in the later years of his administration.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Jets' starter gives his take about drafting a QB", "fullContent": "Stephen A. Smith believes Justin Fields' future as an NFL starter hinges on his success with the Jets, warning this could be his last shot. (1:30)\n\nStephen A. on Justin Fields' move to Jets: 'His career is on the line' (1:30)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- A look at what's happening around the New York Jets:\n\n1. QB or not to QB? The Jets have a $30 million guarantee riding on Justin Fields, which suggests they're not likely to pick a quarterback with their first-round pick (No. 7) in the April 24 draft. They've already anointed him QB1, giving the impression they believe in his ability to resurrect his career.\n\nBut could they hedge their bet by drafting one on Day 2 or 3? Fields, for his part, dodged that subject like a would-be tackler.\n\n\"I don't really like to answer rhetorical questions,\" he said this week, commenting on how he would react if the Jets draft a quarterback. \"I'm willing to teach, but I'm not really interested in rhetorical questions.\"\n\nHe probably meant to say \"hypothetical,\" and he's right. At this point, it's just conjecture, but as Hall of Fame executive Ron Wolf proved many years ago with the Green Bay Packers, it's never a bad thing to keep refueling the quarterback pipeline. The goal is to find the right value in Rounds 2 to 7, which can be tricky for a team with so many needs like the Jets.\n\nIf they're interested in picking a quarterback, the Jets are taking a stealth approach. There hasn't been a parade of top-30 visits to One Jets Drive. In fact, only two have been reported -- Tyler Shough (Louisville) and Cam Miller (North Dakota State). They met with Jalen Milroe (Alabama) at his pro day, and they had coaches present at the pro days for many of the other second-tier prospects, but they're not coming off as a team hell-bent on adding a quarterback.\n\n\"You're not looking for average play at quarterback anymore,\" ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. said. \"You're not looking for a single or a double at this stage of the game. You're looking for a triple or a home run, preferably a grand slam.\"\n\nToward that end, teams in the second-tier market are looking for a prospect with an outstanding trait, something special that can be cultivated. For instance: Milroe has a powerful arm and outstanding speed, qualities that might convince a team to overlook his accuracy issues from college. Shough, Will Howard (Ohio State) and Kyle McCord (Syracuse) excelled as play-action passers, which appeals to the Jets because that will be a big part of their offense.\n\nAll of them could be available for the Jets in the second round (No. 42). It's not likely, but maybe Jaxson Dart (Ole Miss) will slip. It would be a bold statement to take a quarterback this high. Chances are it will happen on Day 3.\n\nThe New York Jets named Justin Fields as their new QB1. Barry Reeger/Imagn Images\n\n2. Waiting in the wings: The quarterback decision could hinge on the new administration's evaluation of 2024 fifth-round pick Jordan Travis, who sat out last season because of a horrific lower-leg injury in college.\n\nCoach Aaron Glenn said Travis was a \"pretty damn good player\" at Florida State, but he stopped short of saying Travis will be cleared for OTA practices next month. \"If he's ready to play, he's going to compete,\" Glenn said.\n\nIt wouldn't bode well for Travis if they add another quarterback to the room.\n\n3. With the seventh pick... : With 11 days to go before the draft, the top candidates for the Jets' pick at No. 7 are tackles Will Campbell (LSU) and Armand Membou (Missouri) and tight end Tyler Warren (Penn State). This is based on conversations with league sources.\n\nThe ESPN draft predictor says Membou is the most likely choice, followed by linebacker Jalon Walker (Georgia) and running back Ashton Jeanty (Boise State). The predictor uses expert mock drafts, Scouts, Inc. grades and team needs to formulate its percentages.\n\n4. Did you know? The Jets are one of only four teams that have used three first-round picks on offensive linemen since 2020 (Mekhi Becton, Alijah Vera-Tucker and Olu Fashanu). Out of the four teams, the Jets are the only one with all three picks in the top 14.\n\nHow much is too much? It's a question worth pondering as they mull another offensive line choice.\n\nThe two other factors are they don't have a clear-cut replacement for Morgan Moses at right tackle, and their starting guards (Vera-Tucker and John Simpson) are entering the final year of their contracts.\n\n5. A name to watch: The Jets are keeping close tabs on edge rusher Shemar Stewart (Texas A&M). They met at his pro day and have stayed in touched. Glenn, of course, is a former Texas A&M star.\n\nESPN draft analyst Field Yates called Stewart a \"fascinating\" prospect, \"the most interesting player in the draft.\"\n\nStewart (6-foot-5, 267 pounds) blew up the combine by running the 40-yard dash in 4.59 seconds and notching a 40-inch vertical jump. His testing was off the charts, but he registered only 4.5 career sacks at A&M.\n\nDespite the modest production, Stewart is projected as a first-rounder because of his physical skills. It will be a stunner if the Jets took him at No. 7, but maybe he will be an option in a trade-down scenario.\n\n6. On the edge: The Jets are in good shape on the edge, with Will McDonald IV and Jermaine Johnson, but you can never have too many edge rushers, right? And let's not forget, Johnson is coming back from Achilles surgery.\n\n\"He's working his ass off to get back to where he needs to be, and that player has a lot of confidence in who he is,\" Glenn said. \"We have a lot of confidence in him, so we're looking forward to him getting back on the field.\"\n\n7. Gone, but not forgotten: Quarterback Aaron Rodgers has left the building, but his presence still is felt.\n\nMiddle linebacker Jamien Sherwood said he learned a lot from Rodgers, practicing against him and hearing his perspective on how certain defensive schemes can be attacked by quarterbacks.\n\n\"He helped create a standard for myself and those other guys on offense,\" Sherwood said. \"He really basically left a mark on all of us. He taught us all so much in a short span of time that we will all carry for the rest of our lives, the rest of our football careers. He meant a lot to us.\"\n\nAaron Rodgers last season with Jets Aaron Rodgers finished 25th in QBR last season (48.2), the second-worst mark of his career, behind only the last time he started multiple games in 2022. He also averaged career lows in yards per attempt and yards per dropback. Rank QBR 48.2 25th Yards per attempt 6.7* 28th Yards per dropback 5.8* 27th * Career lows\n\n-- ESPN Research\n\n8. Tall story: With Brandon Stephens (6-1) joining Sauce Gardner (6-3), the Jets have the tallest starting cornerbacks in the league, based on combined height and current depth charts.\n\n\"I think it's going to be a hell of a combo,\" said Stephens, who signed a three-year, $36 million contract as a free agent.\n\nGet ready for a lot of aggressive man-to-man coverage.\n\n9. Safety first: Incumbent Tony Adams signed his RFA tender ($3.3 million) to secure his return. He, Andre Cisco and Isaiah Oliver are the only experienced safeties on the roster, making it a draft need. No fewer than four safeties have made top-30 visits, most notably Jaylen Reed (Penn State), who attended the same high school as Gardner in Detroit.\n\n10. The last word: \"It's awesome. When I saw him, it's really like the old days. I don't think our relationship has skipped a beat. I'm definitely excited to play with him.\" -- Fields on his reunion with former Ohio State teammate Garrett Wilson."}

Among these items was an old leather-bound journal that she aptly named her Inspiration Journal.\n\nThroughout the second half of her life, Grandma Zelda used this journal to jot down ideas, thoughts, quotes, song lyrics, and anything else that moved her. She would read excerpts from her journal to me when I was growing up, and I would listen and ask questions. I honestly credit a part of who I am now to the wisdom she bestowed on me when I was young.\n\nAlthough I’ve shared some of her wisdom in the past here on the blog and with our newsletter subscribers, today is the day she became an angel ten years ago. So to honor her, I want to share some of my favorite excerpts from her journal that I actually remember her sharing with me before she died. I’ve done my best to sort, copyedit, and reorganize her thoughts into twelve inspiring bullet points. I hope you find value in them…\n\n1. Breathe in the future, breathe out the past.\n\nNo matter where you are or what you’re going through, always believe that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Never expect, assume, or demand. Just do your best, control the elements you can control, and then let it be. Because once you have done what you can, if it is meant to be, it will happen, or it will show you the next step that needs to be taken.\n\n2. Life CAN be simple again.\n\nJust choose to focus on one thing at a time. You don’t have to do it all, and you don’t have to do it all right now. Breathe, be present, and do your best with what’s in front of you. What you put into life, life will often give you back many times over. (Read “The Power of Now” — a book that once sat on my grandma’s nightstand.)\n\n3. Let others take you as you are, or not at all.\n\nSpeak and walk your truth even if your voice and legs shake. By being yourself you put something beautiful into the world that was not there before. So walk your path confidently and don’t expect anyone else to understand your journey, especially if they have not been exactly where you are going.\n\n4. You are not who you used to be, and that’s OK.\n\nYou’ve been hurt; you’ve gone through numerous ups and downs that have made you who you are today. Over the years, so many things have happened — things that have changed your perspective, taught you lessons, and forced your spirit to grow. As time passes, nobody stays the same, but some people will still tell you that you have changed. Respond to them by saying, “Of course I’ve changed. That’s what life is all about. But I’m still the same person, just a little stronger now than I ever was before.”\n\n5. Everything that happens helps you grow, even if it’s hard to see right now.\n\nCircumstances will direct you, correct you, and perfect you over time. So whatever you do, hold on to hope. The tiniest thread will twist into an unbreakable cord. Let hope anchor you in the possibility that this is not the end of your story – that the change in the tides will eventually bring you to peaceful shores.\n\n6. Happiness is a priceless asset.\n\nDon’t just educate yourself to be rich, educate yourself to be happy. That way when you get older you’ll know the true value of things, not the price. You will come to realize that the best days are the days when you don’t need anything extreme or special to happen to make you smile. You simply appreciate the moments and feel gratitude, seeking nothing else, nothing more. That is what true happiness is all about in the end. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the Happiness and Growth chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)\n\n7. Be determined to be positive on the average day.\n\nUnderstand that the greater part of your misery or unhappiness is determined not by your circumstances, but by your attitude. So give yourself a break today. Instead of dwelling on people who have let you down, refocus your time and energy on appreciating those who lift you up. Remember, you can’t control the impolite things some people say and do to you, but you can decide not to be distracted by them.\n\n8. Pay close attention to people you care about.\n\nSometimes when a loved one says, “I’m okay,” they need you to look them in the eyes, hug them tight, and reply, “I know you’re not.” And don’t be too upset if some people only seem to remember you when they need you. Feel privileged that you are like a beacon of light that comes to their minds when there is darkness in their lives.\n\n9. Autonomy is a gift you can give.\n\nSometimes you have to let a person go so they can grow. Because, over the course of their lives, it is not what you do for them, but what you have taught them to do for themselves that will make them a successful human being.\n\n10. You will outgrow some relationships.\n\nSometimes getting the results you crave means distancing yourself from people that don’t serve your best interests. This allows you to make space for those who support you in being the absolute best version of yourself. It happens gradually as you grow. You find out who you are and what you need, and then you realize that people you’ve known for awhile don’t see things the way you do. So you keep the wonderful memories, but find yourself moving on.\n\n11. You don’t need anyone else’s permission to listen to your intuition.\n\nIt’s usually better to look back on life and say, “I can’t believe I did that,” than to look back and say, “I wish I did that.” In the end people will judge you in some way anyway. So don’t live your life trying to impress others. Instead live your life impressing yourself. Love yourself enough to never lower your standards for anyone.\n\n12. Endings often create beginnings to wonderful journeys.\n\nIf you’re looking for a happy ending and can’t seem to find one, maybe it’s time to start looking for a new beginning. Brush yourself off and accept that you have to fail from time to time — that’s how you learn. The strongest people out there — the ones with a genuine smile — are often the same people who have fought the toughest battles. They’re smiling because they’ve decided that they’re not going to let anything hold them down. They’re letting go and moving forward, one step at a time.\n\nPromise yourself…\n\nAs I’m wrapping up this short tribute to my grandma, I’m also reminded of a poem excerpt by Christian D. Larson that she used to have hanging on her refrigerator when I was a kid. As soon as I was old enough to understand the poem, my grandma made a photocopy of it for me, and over 30 years later I still have that same photocopy laminated and hanging on my office bulletin board. These are words my grandma said she strived to live by:\n\nPromise Yourself…\n\nTo think only the best, to work only for the best, and to do the best you can.\n\nTo be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own.\n\nTo forgive the mistakes of the past and press on to greater achievements in the present.\n\nTo wear a friendly countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile.\n\nTo give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others.\n\nTo be too focused for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too at peace to permit the presence of trouble.\n\nTo think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world, not in loud words but great deeds.\n\nTo live in faith that the whole world is on your side so long as you are true to the best that is in you.\n\nNow it’s your turn!\n\nBefore you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂\n\nWhich one of my grandma’s points resonated the most today?\n\nFinally, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week."}

Cook", "fullContent": "Vietnam\n\nA good friend is traveling through Southeast Asia and is presently on a motorcycle tour through Vietnam. This is a place the US tried to obliterate from the planet half a century ago but failed, thank God. I personally declined to participate, as did many young men of my generation. In retaliation, the CIA tried to kill us with LSD, thorazine, and other poisons. Some survived, some were crippled, many didn’t make it. Come to think of it, wasn’t this what the ongoing COVID “planscamdemic” has been all about?\n\nHere’s a nice pic of a couple of happy Vietnamese boys whose country prevailed despite the genocide. Maybe we’ll see pics like this of Palestinian boys someday. Do you think?\n\n.\n\nSource\n\n.\n\nBritish Empire\n\nI have been reading biographies of our Founding Fathers. I have finished ones on George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and am now reading one on John Adams. One reason Adams reaches out to me is that like him, I also have ancestors (two and possibly three lines) that go back to the 1630s and the Great Puritan Migration. In fact, like Adams forebears, they also settled in and around Braintree, Massachusetts, so must have known each other.\n\nAdams writes in his notes while serving as post-revolution emissary to England, that there were plenty there who would just have soon annihilated the US from the globe as granted us independence. Like we tried to do to Vietnam. The hatred ran that deep. When that didn’t work, these people yet assumed that sooner or later the Americans would return to the British fold. Adams wrote:\n\n“There is a strong propensity in this people to believe that America is weary of her independence; that she wishes to come back; that the states are in confusion; Congress has lost its authority; no laws, no order, poverty, distress, ruin, and wretchedness; … that smuggling will defeat all our prohibitions, imposts, and revenues…This they love to believe.”\n\nSo it seems pertinent that I will soon be continuing my serialization of my book Our Country, Then and Now with Chapter 8, entitled “Rule Britannia.” This chapter traces how the British Empire began its march to world domination in the late 16th century during the reign of Elizabeth I, Britain’s constant warfare against European powers over the next several centuries, the crushing defeat of France during the Napoleonic Wars, the consolidation of British hegemony during the 19th century, and the epochal struggle over South African gold and diamonds culminating with the Boer Wars. I conclude with the campaign by Cecil Rhodes and Nathaniel Rothschild to form a “secret society” with the goal to “recover America for the British Empire.” (Rhodes’s words)\n\nWhat I am trying to do is figure out how Britain was able to sucker the US into providing the money and manpower for them to annihilate Germany during World Wars I and II and to see clearly how they are doing it today to get the US to fight World War III against Russia. This includes joining with Israel in keeping the US fully bogged down in the Islamic world with the “War on Terror,” which I see as just another British imperial project.\n\nHoly Week\n\nTomorrow is Palm Sunday, which commemorates Jesus’s final entry into Jerusalem. Maundy Thursday is the day of Jesus’s Last Supper with his disciples, and Good Friday is the Crucifixion. Then comes Easter Sunday, April 20, the day of the Resurrection.\n\nThis year both the Eastern and Western churches celebrate Easter on the same day, which is a rarity due to the difference in calendars. A good omen for sure! Some have commented that the divide between Russia and the rest of Europe reflects the 11th century schism between the Orthodox and Catholic religions. If so, it’s time for healing!\n\nLately we have been posting regular readings from Jesus’s journey toward his Passion, mainly from the Gospel of John. Even though these don’t get as may “hits” as our political articles, they still have been getting a lot of “reads,” “likes,” and comments.\n\nWe certainly don’t mean any of this to imply an endorsement of any particular denomination or even the Christian religion over any other faith. We do happen to believe that Jesus was a real person and that what he suffered and accomplished has application to every persuasion and every individual. Through him we are seeing spiritual principles unfold and demonstrated in the most vivid and often painful way.\n\nWe would also very much like to see countries, like the US, that profess to have some degree of respect for religion actually live up to that by giving up their evil and sinful ways, particularly the greed and violence that seems to rule the world today. A word to our leaders: stop making excuses.\n\nBô Yin Râ\n\nImage is from the Public Domain\n\nWe have greatly appreciated the positive responses to our choice to focus on the spiritual writings of German spiritual master Bô Yin Râ (Joseph Anton Schneiderfranken (1876-1943). He doesn’t write only about Jesus and the Christian religion, as he often focuses more on broad spiritual principles and practices. Still, his commentaries on Jesus himself are priceless in terms of explaining and clearing up a lot of the confusion that reigns in our attitudes toward Christianity.\n\nAccordingly, we will be pleased during Holy Week to present a series of six successive postings about Jesus and his mission by Bô Yin Râ that will run from Monday through Thursday, then on Saturday and Sunday. Friday will be devoted to a posting on the Catholic ceremony of the Stations of the Cross, along with some musical selections.\n\nConclusion\n\nEven with so much going on in the world, you will certainly excuse us for taking a break from most news-related postings during the coming week.\n\nAs always, we are grateful to our growing number of readers for sticking with us and taking part in our very humble mission.\n\nFadi, Lewis, and I wish you, your friends, your families, your colleagues, and all with whose lives you are linked a wonderful springtime and a happy and blessed Easter.\n\n*\n\nClick the share button below to email/forward this article.

With speculation surrounding a more refined design, advanced connectivity options, and enhanced display capabilities, this next-generation smartwatch could set new benchmarks for functionality and innovation. Below, we explore five potential upgrades that could shape the future of the Apple Watch Ultra series and elevate the wearable experience. The video below from Demon’s Tech gives us more details about the rumored Apple Watch Ultra 3.\n\nA Slimmer, More Compact Design\n\nA major focus of the Apple Watch Ultra 3 appears to be its design. Reports suggest that the device could be up to 15% thinner than its predecessor, offering a sleeker and more compact profile. This reduction in thickness would not only enhance its aesthetic appeal but also improve comfort during extended wear.\n\nThe Ultra series is known for its rugged durability, and the Ultra 3 is expected to maintain this hallmark feature while introducing a more refined form factor. This balance between toughness and elegance could make it an ideal choice for users who demand both functionality and style. Whether you’re navigating extreme outdoor conditions or attending formal events, the slimmer design could make the Ultra 3 a versatile and practical companion.\n\nEnhanced Display: LTPO OLED 3.0 and Brighter Visibility\n\nThe display of the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is rumored to receive a substantial upgrade with the introduction of LTPO OLED 3.0 technology. This advanced display panel could offer improved energy efficiency, smoother transitions between refresh rates, and superior viewing angles. Additionally, the brightness level might increase from 3,000 nits to an impressive 3,500 nits, making sure excellent visibility even in challenging lighting conditions such as direct sunlight or underwater environments.\n\nAn edge-to-edge design could further expand the screen’s usable area, providing a more immersive viewing experience. These enhancements would be particularly beneficial for outdoor enthusiasts, divers, and athletes who rely on clear visuals to monitor metrics or navigate their surroundings. The combination of advanced display technology and increased brightness could make the Ultra 3 a standout device for users who prioritize clarity and functionality.\n\nSatellite Connectivity: Emergency SOS Support\n\nOne of the most intriguing potential features of the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is the addition of satellite connectivity. This capability could enable emergency SOS communication in areas without cellular coverage, allowing users to send distress signals and contact emergency services when off the grid.\n\nFor adventurers, hikers, and campers exploring remote locations, this feature could provide an invaluable safety net. By integrating satellite technology, Apple could position the Ultra 3 as a leader in safety-focused wearables, offering users peace of mind in unpredictable or hazardous situations. This innovation would underscore the Ultra series’ commitment to supporting active lifestyles and enhancing user safety.\n\n5G Connectivity: Faster Speeds and Standalone Functionality\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 3 is expected to be the first in its series to incorporate 5G connectivity. This upgrade could deliver faster data speeds, smoother streaming, and more reliable call handling, all powered by eSIM technology. With 5G, users might experience seamless video calls, real-time navigation, and fitness tracking, even in areas with high network demand.\n\nThis advancement aligns with Apple’s broader vision of making the Apple Watch a fully standalone device, reducing its reliance on a paired iPhone. For users seeking greater independence and enhanced functionality, 5G connectivity could represent a significant leap forward. The ability to access high-speed internet and advanced features directly from the watch could redefine how users interact with wearable technology.\n\nRelease Timeline and Pricing Expectations\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 3 is likely to be unveiled in September 2025, with availability expected shortly thereafter. While the current model starts at $799, the new version could see a slight price increase due to its advanced features and potential external factors such as inflation or supply chain challenges. However, Apple may also choose to maintain the existing price point to remain competitive in the premium smartwatch market.\n\nThe pricing strategy will likely reflect Apple’s commitment to delivering value while staying ahead of competitors. Whether the price remains consistent or increases slightly, the Ultra 3’s anticipated features could justify its position as a premium wearable device.\n\nAnticipating the Next Leap in Wearable Technology\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 3 is shaping up to be a highly anticipated device, blending a sleeker design, innovative display technology, and advanced connectivity features. From its brighter LTPO OLED 3.0 display to the potential inclusion of satellite SOS capabilities and 5G connectivity, the Ultra 3 could offer a compelling mix of innovation and practicality.\n\nFor outdoor enthusiasts, professionals, and tech-savvy users alike, the Ultra 3’s rumored upgrades could redefine expectations for what a smartwatch can achieve. As the release date approaches, these potential advancements highlight Apple’s ongoing commitment to pushing the boundaries of wearable technology and delivering devices that cater to diverse user needs.\n\nHere are more guides from our previous articles and guides related to Apple Watch Ultra 3 that you may find helpful.\n\nSource & Image Credit: Demon’s Tech\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

This partially floods an expansive grove of white willow trees, creating a submerged forest of mysteriously beautiful scenery in which the trees appear mirrored in the surface of the water.\n\nThe trees are almost entirely white until mid-April, but then their new spring leaves come in, creating an even more densely vegetated duplicated landscape.\n\nAs amazing as the submerged forest looks by day, though, it’s even more ethereally breathtaking at night.\n\nWith the willows illuminated as part of a special light-up event, they appear to be floating in space, since the rural location of the lake (which is about 40 minutes by car from Akayu Station on the Yamagata Shinkansen line) means there are hardly any other sources of light after sundown, except for the moon.\n\nThis year, the submerged forest will be illuminated from 6 to 9 p.m. on the nights of April 19 and 20, and from April 26 to May 11 (provided the weather isn’t rainy). There is an entrance fee of 1,000 yen (US$6.70) per person to the adjacent park, which goes to cover the costs of the illumination and contributes to a local nature conservation fund.\n\nThe park also has some rustic after-dark amenities during the event, and the illumination for the trees is provided entirely by battery-operated sources, so there won’t be any noisy gas-powered generators spoiling the tranquil mood.\n\n▼ Lake Shirakawa submerged forest location\n\nAs for what else there is to see in Iide, the local tourism office’s promotional video makes it look like exactly the sort of place that sparks daydreams of quitting your office job and moving to the Japanese countryside to start living the slow life.\n\nBut even if you spend only one night in Iide to see its submerged forest, odds are it’s a night you’ll never forget.\n\nRelated: Lake Shirakawa submerged forest tourism information website\n\nSource, images: PR Times\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

Lufthansa has launched its newest Miles & More Mileage Bargains for April, and there are options if you plan on spending summer in Europe.\n\nLufthansa Miles & More Bargains Promotion Details\n\nThis month’s Miles & More Mileage Bargains list comprises hundreds of deals on flights worldwide. This includes 369 flights from Delhi to around the globe at a bargain. And flights into Delhi as well. Discounts vary depending on your destination and fare class, and taxes can be pretty high, but you’ll still find some great offers on business, premium economy, and economy class redemptions. Remember, you must book these before April 30 and fly between July 15 and August 31, 2025.\n\nAnd before we go too far, understand that these flights can’t be cancelled for a refund. Your travel plans should be firm before you confirm a reservation.\n\nDelhi to European destinations costs 55,000 miles roundtrip in Business Class, and similarly for a round trip from the other origin point to India. The flight is on Lufthansa from Delhi to Europe (via Frankfurt on the 340-600 or via Munich on the A380) and from there on an A320/21/regional jet, depending on the last-mile opportunity. One hundred thirty-nine combinations are available.\n\nSimilarly, 139 premium economy deals from Delhi on Lufthansa for 40,000 miles round-trip in premium economy and 30,000 miles in Economy.\n\nEarning Lufthansa Miles\n\nWhen looking purely at the mileage cost, these flights offer incredible bargains. Unfortunately, earning Lufthansa miles can be difficult, as Miles & More doesn’t partner with any transferable point currency, and the taxes and fees can be costly. However, if you’re interested in taking advantage of these monthly promotions, you may want to consider signing up for the co-branded Lufthansa credit card. Issued by Axis Bank, the Miles & More Axis Bank Credit Cards feature a generous welcome bonus offer of up to 15,000 miles.\n\nBottomline\n\nThere’s no doubt that Lufthansa’s monthly Mileage Bargains can represent a great deal. At 55,000 miles round-trip for a flight in business class, you won’t find a lower rate anywhere. However, taxes are high, and earning Lufthansa miles isn’t as simple as transferring points. Instead, you’ll want to grab the Lufthansa Miles & More card or use other methods to help build your balance. These monthly offers present great value if you have the required miles and can travel during the prescribed dates.\n\nWhat do you think of Lufthansa’s Bargain on round trip business class?\n\nLiked our articles and our efforts?

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Carlo Rino Group Berhad's (KLSE:CARLORINO) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Carlo Rino Group Berhad, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.14 = RM26m ÷ (RM202m - RM16m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nTherefore, Carlo Rino Group Berhad has an ROCE of 14%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Specialty Retail industry average of 10% it's much better.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Carlo Rino Group Berhad\n\nKLSE:CARLORINO Return on Capital Employed April 13th 2025\n\nHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Carlo Rino Group Berhad's ROCE against it's prior returns. If you'd like to look at how Carlo Rino Group Berhad has performed in the past in other metrics, you can view this free graph of Carlo Rino Group Berhad's past earnings, revenue and cash flow .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at Carlo Rino Group Berhad. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 14%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 87%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Carlo Rino Group Berhad can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Since the stock has returned a staggering 343% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue."}

While they share some similarities in design philosophy and quality, their differences in performance, functionality, and intended use cases make them suitable for different workflows. Choosing the right device depends on understanding what each offers and how it aligns with your specific requirements. The video below from GregsGadgets compares the two devices.\n\nDesign and Build: Laptop vs. Tablet\n\nThe M4 MacBook Air features Apple’s signature clamshell design, combining a lightweight yet durable aluminum build. It includes a full-size keyboard with Touch ID for secure logins, a spacious trackpad, and two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt support. Available in 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch sizes, it caters to users who prefer larger screens for productivity and multitasking. Its slim profile and fanless design make it both portable and silent during operation.\n\nIn contrast, the M3 iPad Air is a tablet-first device, designed for maximum portability. Its ultra-slim and lightweight build makes it easy to carry, and it supports the Magic Keyboard for a laptop-like experience. However, adding accessories like the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil increases its weight and thickness, reducing its portability advantage. The iPad Air’s design is ideal for users who value the ability to switch seamlessly between tablet and laptop modes, offering flexibility for both casual and creative tasks.\n\nDisplay Features: Touchscreen vs. Traditional\n\nBoth devices feature Liquid Retina displays with P3 wide color and True Tone technology, making sure vibrant visuals and accurate color reproduction. However, the iPad Air stands out with its touchscreen functionality and compatibility with Apple Pencil. These features make it an excellent choice for artists, designers, and users who prefer hands-on interaction for tasks like sketching, note-taking, or photo editing.\n\nThe MacBook Air, while offering larger display options, lacks touchscreen capabilities. This may be a limitation for users accustomed to direct screen interaction. However, its traditional laptop display is optimized for tasks like typing, coding, and extended reading, making it a strong choice for productivity-focused users.\n\nPerformance: M4 vs. M3\n\nPerformance is a key differentiator between these devices. The M4 MacBook Air is powered by Apple’s latest M4 chip, delivering superior CPU, GPU, and memory performance. With 16GB of memory as standard, it excels in demanding tasks such as video editing, software development, and heavy multitasking. Its advanced thermal management ensures consistent performance even during prolonged use.\n\nThe M3 iPad Air, while still powerful, runs on the older M3 chip and includes 8GB of memory. It is well-suited for casual use, creative tasks, and light productivity, such as browsing, streaming, and basic photo editing. However, it may struggle with more intensive workflows, making it less ideal for professionals who require high-performance computing.\n\nPortability and Connectivity: Mobility vs. Longevity\n\nThe iPad Air excels in portability. Its lightweight design and optional 5G cellular connectivity make it an excellent choice for users who are frequently on the move. Whether you’re traveling, working remotely, or attending meetings, the iPad Air ensures seamless connectivity without relying solely on Wi-Fi networks.\n\nThe MacBook Air, while lacking cellular connectivity, compensates with better battery life. It offers 10 to 14 hours of usage, compared to the iPad Air’s 7 to 8 hours. This makes the MacBook Air a dependable choice for extended work sessions, particularly for users who prioritize uninterrupted productivity over mobility.\n\nAudio and Camera: Media vs. Versatility\n\nThe MacBook Air features a superior speaker system, delivering richer and more immersive sound quality. This makes it an excellent option for media consumption, video calls, and audio editing. Its three-microphone array ensures clear audio capture, enhancing the overall experience for professional and personal use.\n\nThe iPad Air, on the other hand, includes a rear camera, adding versatility for tasks like document scanning, photography, and creative projects. This feature is particularly useful for artists, educators, and professionals who rely on visual content creation. While its speakers are adequate for casual use, they don’t match the MacBook Air’s audio quality.\n\nOperating Systems: macOS vs. iPadOS\n\nThe choice between macOS and iPadOS is a critical factor in deciding which device is right for you. macOS, available on the MacBook Air, is a robust and flexible operating system designed for professional workflows. It supports a wide range of software, advanced multitasking, and desktop-class applications, making it ideal for productivity-focused users.\n\niPadOS, while simpler and more intuitive, is tailored for casual users and creatives. Its touch-friendly interface and app ecosystem cater to those who prioritize ease of use and creative applications. However, its limitations in multitasking and software compatibility may be a drawback for users who require a full desktop experience.\n\nValue and Pricing: What’s Worth Your Investment?\n\nWhen evaluating value, the MacBook Air often emerges as the better option. It offers more memory, storage, and performance at a similar price point. In contrast, the iPad Air becomes significantly more expensive when paired with accessories like the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil, narrowing the price gap between the two devices.\n\nFor users who need a full laptop experience, the MacBook Air provides better overall value. However, for those who prioritize portability, touch interaction, and creative flexibility, the iPad Air remains a compelling choice despite its higher accessory costs.\n\nWhich Device Is Right for You?\n\nThe M4 MacBook Air is the ideal choice for users who need a powerful, versatile laptop for professional tasks. Its superior performance, larger display options, and robust operating system make it a reliable companion for productivity, multitasking, and demanding workflows.\n\nThe M3 iPad Air, on the other hand, is best suited for users who prioritize portability, touch interaction, and creative applications. Its lightweight design, touchscreen functionality, and Apple Pencil support make it an excellent choice for artists, designers, and casual users.\n\nUltimately, the decision comes down to your specific needs and priorities. If you require a traditional laptop for professional use, the MacBook Air is the clear winner. However, if you value flexibility, mobility, and hands-on interaction, the iPad Air might be the better fit. Carefully consider your workflow and lifestyle to ensure your investment aligns with your goals.\n\nExplore further guides and articles from our vast library that you may find relevant to your interests in M4 MacBook Air.\n\nSource & Image Credit: GregsGadgets\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

It is also full of overcoming.”\n\nCharacter and wisdom are both sculpted over time. These qualities come with loss, lessons, and triumphs. They come after doubts, second guesses, and exploring unknowns. If there was a definitive path to personal growth, everyone would be on it. Truth be told, the seeds of your success are often planted in your past failures, and some of your best stories will likely come from overcoming your greatest struggles.\n\nMy husband (Marc) and I learned all of that the hard way. Over the past fifteen years we have dealt with several significant hardships, including the sudden death of a sibling, the loss of a best friend to illness, betrayal from a business partner, an unexpected breadwinning employment layoff, and more. These experiences were brutal. Each of them knocked us down and kept us down for a while. But when our time of mourning was over after each tragedy, we pressed forward, stronger, and with a greater understanding and respect for life.\n\nSo my challenge to you today is this: Start looking at life’s hard realities and challenges as paths that ultimately lead to your growth. Easier said than done, of course, but here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. The first few steps forward won’t be easy.\n\nThe beginnings to good things are often the hardest, but it’s these hard steps that pave the way to better times. Be strong and keep going; it will be worth it in the end. The greatest miracle of your success from this point forward will not be that you finished, it will be that you found the strength and courage to begin, again and again.\n\nAnd remember, it’s not that those who are strong never get weak in the knees, or that they never hold their breath just before they embark, it’s that while their knees are shaking they still encourage themselves to inhale as they take the next tiniest step.\n\n2. Progress in life comes slowly and gradually.\n\nThere are no shortcuts. Progress comes from the process. The secret to your success is found in your daily routine. So trust the journey you are on. And remind yourself that true purpose has no time limit. True purpose has no deadline. Don’t stress and overwhelm yourself. Just do what you can, consistently.\n\nTruly, persistence is the single most common characteristic of high achievers in all walks of life. They simply refuse to give up on the things that matter most to them. They have learned that the longer you hang in there, the greater the chance that something will gradually happen in your favor.\n\n3. You will always have less control than you desire.\n\nThe only thing you can absolutely control in life is how you react to things out of your control, and there’s a lot you can’t control. The better you adapt to this reality, the more powerful your highs will be, and the more quickly you’ll be able to bounce back from the lows. In other words, the most powerful changes happen in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power over instead of craving control over everything you don’t.\n\nAs your life unfolds, you will often realize that many of the times you thought you were being rejected from something good, you were in fact being redirected to something better. You simply don’t have to control everything to find growth, happiness, or success. You just need to do your best every day, let go, and let life happen the way it’s supposed to. Because oftentimes the outcomes you can’t change end up changing you and helping you grow. (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the Adversity chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)\n\n4. You can’t avoid risk without avoiding growth.\n\nAs Henry David Thoreau once said, “When it’s time to die, let us not discover that we have never lived.”\n\nLiving is a risk. Happiness is a risk. If you’re not a little uncertain sometimes, then you’re not doing it right. Don’t worry about mistakes and failures, worry about what you’re giving up when you don’t even try. Worry about the life you’re not living and the joy you’re forgoing, as you merely exist in the safety of your comfort zone 24/7. Give yourself permission to be one of the people who survived doing it wrong, who made mistakes, but recovered from them and grew stronger.\n\n5. Your most common daily problems are mostly in your head.\n\nThe mind is indeed your biggest battleground on a daily basis. It’s the place where the fiercest conflict resides. It’s where half the things you feared would happen, never actually happened. It’s where your expectations get the best of you. And it’s where you fall victim to your own train of thought time and time again. Truly, the primary cause of unhappiness and defeat on the average day is rarely the current situation, but instead your inner resistance to it. Inner growth on the other hand usually comes down to acceptance of the current situation, and then taking constructive action.\n\nHuman beings become quite remarkable when they start thinking that they can do great things, right now, without needing anything more. When you gain trust in yourself and the present moment, you have discovered the first secret of growth and success. Because finding your way is not about going somewhere new every second; it’s about seeing familiar ground in new ways. Once you do, you will realize the only difference between stumbling blocks and stepping stones is how you use them. (Read “The Last Lecture”.)\n\n6. Long-term happiness can’t be bought (it can be earned).\n\nTo paraphrase Dave Ramsey, too many people buy things they don’t need with money they don’t have to impress people they don’t know. Don’t be one of them. Fill your life with lots of experiences, not lots of things. Have incredible stories to tell, not incredible clutter in your closets.\n\nSeriously, if you’d rather be surrounded by pristine objects of little significance rather than by loads of fulfilling memories, stay focused on acquiring tangible possessions. Otherwise, stop fixating on things you can touch and start caring about the things that touch you. Each of us has a unique fire in our heart for something that makes us feel alive. It’s your duty to find it and keep it lit. Promise yourself that you will stay true to your loves, your values, and your purpose through thick and thin. Let your heart and mind work as one. Do what it takes so that one day, many moons from now, you can look back at your life, take one final breath, and crack an honest smile.\n\n7. Not everyone will support you.\n\nIf you take every insult or rude remark personally, you will be offended for the rest of your life. One of the most freeing things we learn in life is that we don’t have to agree with everyone, everyone doesn’t have to agree with us, and that it’s OK. As Bruce Lee once said, “I’m not in this world to live up to your expectations and you’re not in this world to live up to mine.” Live by this quote. Don’t let the opinions of others make you forget.\n\nOf course, it takes time to learn how to NOT judge yourself through someone else’s eyes, but once you do the world is yours to explore freely. We have all been placed on this earth to discover our own life, and we will never be happy or successful if we try to live someone else’s idea of it. So give up worrying too much about what others think of you. And remember that taking a step back to gracefully walk away from situations that threaten your peace of mind, values, morals, or self-worth, is almost always a healthy and necessary step forward.\n\n8. You are better off without some people in your daily life.\n\nIt’s during the toughest times of your life that you’ll get to see the true colors of the people who say they care about you. Notice who sticks around and who doesn’t, and be grateful to those who leave you, for they have given you the room to grow in the space they abandoned, and the awareness to appreciate the people who loved you when you didn’t feel lovable.\n\nBottom line: Be okay with giving the gift of your absence to those who do not appreciate and respect your presence.\n\n9. You can’t have joy in life without some pain.\n\nChuck Palahniuk once said, “The only way to find true happiness is to risk being completely cut open.” Nothing could be closer to the truth. Some pain and sadness is necessary. Everything in life is two-sided. You can’t expect to feel pleasure without ever feeling pain, joy without ever feeling sorrow, confidence without ever feeling fearful, hope without ever feeling uncertain, etc. There is no such thing as a one-sided coin in life, with which you can buy a pain-free, trouble-free life.\n\nYes, life is a series of highs and lows — an adventure that requires you to take chances and actions that have the possibility of both success and failure, positive and negative outcomes, etc.\n\n10. Life is always changing, day by day.\n\nGrowth can be painful, change can be painful, but in the end nothing is as painful as staying stuck somewhere you don’t belong. So be selective with your energy today. If you can fix a problem, fix it. If you can’t, accept it and change your thoughts about it. And whatever you do, don’t attempt to invest more energy than you have tripping over something behind you or something that only exists inside your head.\n\nOf course, there will be times when it seems like everything that could possibly go wrong is going wrong. You might feel like you will be stuck in this rut forever, but you won’t. Sure the sun stops shining sometimes, and you may get a huge thunderstorm or two, but eventually the sun will come out to shine. Sometimes it’s just a matter of us staying as present and positive as possible in order to make it to see the sun break through the clouds again.\n\nAnd remind yourself that the trick on the average day is to enjoy the little things. Don’t wish away all your days waiting for better ones ahead. Just do your best to appreciate where you are. You’ve come a long way, and you’re still learning and growing. Be thankful for the progress and lessons. Take them and make the best of things right now.\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nYes, it’s your turn to make your growth a priority today — to give yourself a chance to fully embrace the reminders above. Because your growth won’t always be a priority to others, and it won’t just happen automatically. Practice taking better care of yourself, moving forward, giving yourself grace along the way, and becoming a more reliable part of your own support system.\n\nBut before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay.

The taoru part is just the Japanese pronunciation of “towel,” and ketto is back half of “blanket,” with an O tacked onto the end because Japanese words can’t end in consonants other than N. So while “towelket” might not be a word native English speakers would have made up on their own, it’s pretty easy to understand once you know what its linguistic components are, as a towelket is a kind of lightweight terrycloth blanket that’s popular during the less chilly parts of the year in Japan.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, it’s easy to instantly form a mental image when you hear the compound term “Catbus,” especially if you’re a Studio Ghibli anime fan. And now that you know what a towelket is too, yes, we can confirm that a Catbus towelket is every bit as adorable as it sounds.\n\nRestocked at Ghibli specialty shop Donguri Kyowakoku just in time for the arrival of warm spring afternoons, the Catbus towelket is officially designated by the store as a “napket,” since it’s sized more as a compact throw blanket to use while dozing on the couch than something to wrap yourself up in when going to bed at night. At 120 by 87 centimeters (47.2 by 34.3 inches), the Catbus towelket is made of 100-percent cotton, soft to the touch and as comforting as your 20th rewatch of My Neighbor Totoro on a leisurely lazy Sunday. With the moisture-wicking quality of the fabric, Donguri Kyowakoku says that you can even use the Catbus towelket as a bath towel.\n\nSpeaking of everyone’s favorite forest spirit neighbor, Totoro has a towelket of his own too!\n\nDecked out with illustrations of watermelons, Japanese festival water balloon yoyos, and, of course, corn, this one is perfect whether you’re winding down after some summer fun or grabbing some Zs to charge up for an outing later that day.\n\nThe Totoro towelket is the same size as the Catbus one, but the Kiki’s Delivery Service design is slightly more compact, at 115 by 85 centimeters. Still, there’s room enough for black cat Jiji and three of his kittens.\n\nDuring the film’s ending credits sequence, we see that Jiji has become a daddy during his stay in the town where Kiki has set up her aerial courier enterprise, where he and a local named Lilly caught each other’s feline eyes. While there’s no shortage of merch featuring Jiji, it’s rare for his kids to be represented too, making this towelket a special treat for Kiki’s fans.\n\nFinally, rounding off the Ghibli towelket lineup are two more My Neighbor Totoro designs with repeating patterns, one with Totoro…\n\n…and the other with the Catbus, both, like the Jiji blanket, measuring 115 by 85 centimeters.\n\nPrices start at 2,200 yen (US$14.75) for the Totoro summer and Jiji designs, with the Totoro and Catbus pattern blankets at 3,080 yen and the multi-leg Catbus towelket 4,180 yen. They’re all available through the Donguri Kyowakoku online store here.\n\nSource: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\nTop image: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\nInsert images: Donguri Kyowakoku (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

While most Pokémon have just a single more powerful form they can evolve into, Eevee has a whopping eight different Eeveelutions, as fans have taken to calling them.\n\nEach evolution changes Eevee’s appearance and powers, and Pokémon Trainers can set which it’ll evolve into with the use of special items. But what if instead of using a Fire Stone to trigger the evolution to Fire-type Flareon or a Moon Shard for Dark-type Umbreon, you just fed Eevee a whole bunch of creatine? Then you’d probably end up with something similar to what some fans are seeing in this promotional photo from Japan’s Pokémon Center specialty store, which at first glance looks like an Eevee with freakishly muscular arms.\n\nThe top-left image in the tweet’s photo cluster is definitely one of Eevee, but appears to have given the ordinarily dainty Pokémon a pair of bonkers-buffed-out arms with rippling…biceps? Actually it seems like Eevee has been hitting the gym so hard that it’s developed extra muscles that we humans don’t have in our arms, going by the number of bulges, while also absolutely skipping leg day. Oh, and it also looks like Eevee has shaved all the hair off its arms, leaving them smooth and groomed as if it’s about to flex for the judges at a bodybuilding competition.\n\nThe photo has prompted Japanese Twitter reactions such as:\n\n“Eevee is ripped.”\n\n“Is this what happens if you evolve Eevee into a Fighting-type?”\n\n“At first, no one realized that this merch was foreshadowing for the next Eevee evolution.”\n\nBut while kimo-kawaii, mixing ugly and cute things together, is a subset of visual design in Japan, it’s generally not something the Pokémon franchise dabbles in. So what’s really going on here?\n\nA weird camera angle, and a uniquely constructed plushie.\n\nNew and on sale at the Pokémon Center is the Button Eeevee Backpack-style Pouch, a combination stuffed animal/decorative strap/functional zippered pouch that also has backpack-style straps that you can use as an alternative to the chain.\n\nLook closely, and you can see that Eevee does in fact still have its normal forearms. However, the straps, which are stylized extensions to the tuft of fur at the base of Eevee’s neck, are so fluffy that they almost entirely cover the forearms, and if you pull the straps out to the sides a bit, like in the tweet’s photo, it looks like the straps are instead a new pair of arms for the Pokémon. The strap, which is 26 centimeters (10,2 inches) long and priced at 2,200 yen (US$14.75), went on sale April 10 through the Pokémon Center online store here, and will be available at physical locations from April 12.\n\nSo while we’ve seen Eevee be both a mailbox and a dessert, it hasn’t become a bodybuilder, so if you’re looking for muscles in the Pokémon World, you’ll have to look elsewhere (like here).\n\nSource: Twitter/@pokemon_pdc via IT Media, Pokémon Center\n\nTop photo ©SoraNews24\n\nInsert images: Pokémon Center\n\n©2024 Pokémon. ©1995-2024 Nintendo/Creatures Inc./GAME FREAK inc.\n\nPokémon and Pokémon character names are registered trademarks of Nintendo, Creatures Inc., and GAME FREAK inc.\n\n©Pokémon. ©Nintendo/Creatures Inc./GAME FREAK inc.\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

The technical indicators suggest that this token may soon be able to cross the important resistance level of $1.14.\n\nAnalysts following the rise of the cryptocurrency expect that, on the barrier’s successful breach, prices would then rapidly escalate to the $1.25-$1.50 bracket.\n\nA high-profile transaction recently involved a major holder offloading 3.7 million Fartcoin tokens at $0.90. Even with this huge sale, the price of the token has remained stable around the $1 level, which implies continued confidence on the part of buyers.\n\nI think Fartcoin goes to $1.25 minimum on this run and possibly up to $1.50, will be prob scaling some out there Ofc there will eventually be a decent sized pullback but this meme has the most mindshare, great liquidity, and has transcended to normie world Hot air rises pic.twitter.com/p3zehbD20J — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) April 12, 2025\n\nExperts Warn Of Potential Volatility Risks\n\nMarket analysts have sounded a warning about Fartcoin’s steep price appreciation. The volatile nature of meme coins tends to lead to precipitous price declines with little notice. According to analyst reports, the token’s speculative nature makes it highly susceptible to sudden adjustments.\n\nAs recent trading volumes show growth in interest for Fartcoin, this has been a waving flag for financial advisors that one should be cautious prior to making investments in highly volatile assets.\n\nThis was also evidenced in the stability of the price currently around $1, which suggests that even with the risk associated, it does not dissuade many investors from projected profit maximization.\n\nTechnical Analysis Shows Short-Term Bullish Indicators\n\nIchimoku cloud indicator statistics state that Fartcoin has consolidated above a very strong support level.

While this teaser better acquaints us with Yi Xuan's faction, Yunkui Summit, one highly anticipated group is noticeably missing.\n\nIn a recent Zenless Zone Zero Dev Talk video, Hoyoverse confirms that the adorable, pastel-colored idol faction, Angels of Delusion, are appearing in season two, yet they're still nowhere to be seen in this teaser. I guess that means we won't meet them until after the first Zenless Zone Zero update of 2.0.\n\nDespite the lack of angels, the teaser video is jam-packed with new characters, ranging from Zenless Zone Zero Trigger's allies in the Obol Squad to a mysterious cloaked enemy. If you're a fan of Thirens, you're in luck because the Waifei Peninsula is teeming with anthropomorphic animals and kemonomimi cuties. Yunkui Summit's members include Ju Fufu, the tiger Thiren, and a large panda man. Plus, we have a feeling we might have met that black-haired biker dog somewhere before…\n\nBig update preview videos like this one are common across Hoyoverse's gacha games, so comparing their differences can lead to some interesting conclusions. Specifically, in the season two teaser, Belle and Wise are wearing new outfits in the traditional Waifei style. In Hoyoverse trailers, the main characters never get regional designs just for the sake of it, so I have a feeling we'll get Waifei skins for our Proxy in the new season. It'll be nice to blend in with the local crowd for once!\n\nEven if we didn't get to see the Angels of Delusion in all their bubblegum glory, this trailer hinted at more than a couple of new male characters, which is always a positive, given the drought of men in gacha games. Hopefully, some of our new allies will be A-ranks as well, for the sake of all our wallets."}

They announced it in early 2022 and since then, no product ever came out. They teased it a few times, but it looks like the company pivoted in early 2024 and tried to launch the Modos Paper Monitor. This seemed a more reasonable goal since Boox, Dasung, and Bigme are all involved in this space, so there is an obvious market. However, they were supposed to launch a crowdfunding campaign on Crowd Supply. However, only one update was posted, and the campaign never launched and likely never will.\n\nThe company did release a blog in late December about a physical road map. They said a crowdfunding campaign for their monitor would launch in February 2025, but this has not happened either. It does not look like this project will ever be released, but the company has developed some novel speed modes and refresh systems available on GitHub.\n\nModos is a cautionary tale when a company with no history of making consumer products makes news on all tech blogs with grand ambitions and no follow-through. It is easy to buy into the hype when physical prototypes exist, and nice promotional shots are released. It is a mixed blessing that neither of the two products ever had a crowdfunding campaign, and the developers just ran off with the money.\n\n\n\nMichael Kozlowski Michael Kozlowski is the editor-in-chief at Good e-Reader and has written about audiobooks and e-readers for the past fifteen years.

But there are times when hitting the wrong combination of shortcut keys by accident can break your user experience in ways you might not know how to fix.\n\nYou might be typing along one day, minding your business, and your computer just starts talking to you. This happened to me more than once! Or you’re surfing the web and you suddenly end up with everything zoomed all the way in. Or maybe some of your letter keys mysteriously start to function as arrow keys, seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nBelieve it or not, all of these problems and more are possible, thanks to supposedly helpful features that can destroy your user experience if you enable them by mistake. These are the 12 horrifying self-destruct keys in Windows 11 (or 10) that you need to avoid.\n\n1. My computer just started talking to me: Windows + CTRL + Enter\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe first and worst self-destruct keyboard combo is Windows Narrator, which you might accidentally invoke by hitting Windows key + CTRL + Enter. This feature is designed to help the visually impaired by reading most of the text on-screen through your speakers, with a robotic voice.\n\nBut imagine enabling Windows Narrator by accident when you’re in an open office or a coffee shop, your computer blaring the subject line of your latest email message for everyone to hear. That’s not only a violation of your privacy, but also a huge embarrassment.\n\nThe good news is that you can disable Narrator by hitting the same exact keyboard combination you used to accidentally enable it. The even better news is that you can disable the shortcut itself by navigating to Settings->Accessibility->Narrator and toggling “Keyboard shortcut for Narrator” to off. Then you won’t even be able to turn it on by accident.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n2. I got a dialog for Sticky Keys then everything went crazy: Hit Shift five times\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nLike summoning Candyman, the Sticky Keys dialog box appears when you ask for it five times. You ask for it by hitting the Shift key five times in a row, something you might do one day out of boredom or frustration. Then up pops a dialog box asking if you want to turn on Sticky Keys.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIf you’re smart, you’ll just say “no” to the dialog box and all will be well. But if you mistakenly click “Yes,” Sticky Keys is enabled and your user experience will be worse than being pursued by a ghost with a hook for a hand.\n\nSticky Keys changes Windows so that you can hit the modifier keys (Shift, CTRL, ALT or the Windows key) one at a time and still form keyboard shortcuts with them. Imagine hitting CTRL by itself and then later you’re typing and you hit the letter x. The system treats it as CTRL + X or cut. Or you hit the Windows key to launch your Start menu and then later you type E. It treats that as Win + E, which launches the File Explorer. Pandemonium ensues.\n\nIf you’ve accidentally enabled Sticky Keys, you can disable it the same way, by hitting Shift five times and then clicking No when presented with the dialog box. But why not just turn off the Sticky Keys keyboard shortcut in the first place by navigating to Settings -> Accessibility ->Keyboard->Sticky Keys and toggling “Keyboard shortcut for Sticky keys” to off?\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n3. There’s a box full of code on the right side of my browser: CTRL + Shift + I or F12 in a browser window\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nYou’re surfing the web in your favorite browser – maybe it’s Chrome or Edge – and you suddenly see a new pane on the right side of the screen filled with code. It could be showing you JavaScript errors or HTML, but if you’re not a developer, this is a very unwelcome intrusion into your day.\n\nIf you’ve hit CTRL + Shift + I or F12 by accident, you’ve opened the Developer Tools menu in your browser. For those of us who code web pages for a living, this is a valuable utility that helps view the source of our pages or debug errors. But for most people, it’s a confusing waste of space.\n\nYou can close the Developer Tools either by clicking the X button in its upper right corner or by hitting CTRL + Shift + I a second time.\n\n4. My tab or window just closed: CTRL + W / Alt + F4\n\nThe tab you’re browsing just disappeared, gone as though some evil wizard teleported it off your screen. And you really were getting into that story you had clicked about the cast of Degrassi Junior High … what they look like now is jaw-dropping! Your jaw had fully dropped — and now the entire web page is gone.\n\nYou accidentally hit CTRL + W, which closes a tab in any modern browser. Even worse, you may have hit Alt + F4, which closes the entire window. If you just closed the tab, you can restore it by hitting CTRL + Shift + T.\n\n5. I can’t move among cells in Excel: Scroll Lock\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nYou’re in Excel, trying to move from one cell to another, but instead, the entire screen starts to move while the focus stays fixed on the cell you had focused on. This happens because you accidentally enabled Scroll Lock, an ancient feature that doesn’t work in most programs but is still recognized in Excel.\n\nScroll Lock causes the entire screen to scroll and keeps your cursor in place. The way to turn it off is to hit the key again. On some keyboards, like my Cooler Master MK770, it’s a key combination of Fn + another key.\n\n6. My web pages are getting bigger or smaller: CTRL + mouse wheel\n\nYou’re reading an article, perhaps this one on Tom’s Hardware, and all of a sudden it’s zoomed way in, or the text is painfully small because it’s zoomed way out. You were just trying to scroll down the web page but now everything is out of whack. How the heck did that happen?\n\nIt probably happened because you (or maybe your cat?) were holding down the CTRL key while you were moving your mouse’s scroll wheel. This causes any browser – Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc – to zoom in or out. Moving the scroll wheel up zooms in and moving the scroll wheel down zooms out. You can fix this by using it to zoom in or out again to a comfortable level.\n\n7. I’m typing over my text: Insert key\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nYou’re editing a document in any text editor and you realize that you used the American spelling of color when you’re trying to appeal to a UK audience. You move the cursor over to the space between the O and the R and type the letter U so you can make the word “colour.” But instead of just adding the additional letter, it overwrites the R so you have “colou” as your word.\n\nWhat happened? You hit the Insert key, which toggles the OS between Insert and Overwrite modes. By default, every computer uses Insert mode, which places new letters to the right of the cursor as you type. If you hit the Insert key, however, you turn on Overwrite mode, which causes you to replace whatever’s next to your cursor.\n\nOverwrite is the behavior users were used to in old DOS text editors such as WordPerfect 5.1; today we all expect new characters to be added to our document and, if we want to delete a letter, we hit the Del or Backspace key. Hit Insert again to change the mode back to Insert mode.\n\n8. My window is full screen and toolbars are missing: F11\n\nYou’re in your web browser editing something in Google Docs or reading. All of a sudden, the tabs are gone, the address bar is gone, and even the window widgets (X, minimize, and maximize) are all gone. Yikes!\n\nYou’ve hit F11, which turns the browser and many other programs into a full-screen program, with all the widgets from the window gone. Hit F11 again to restore the window to its former glory.\n\n9. My browser went back all of a sudden: Alt + Left arrow or mouse thumb button\n\nYou’ve just found the answer you were looking for to a very particular tech problem. Perhaps a search engine led you to one of our articles or forum posts. Perhaps you were looking up hakarl recipes and landed on an Icelandic cooking website. Whatever you found, you’ve suddenly lost it: Your browser has gone back a page or two.\n\nFortunately, hitting the forward button in your browser solves this problem, but why did it happen in the first place? Chances are that you either hit Alt + Left arrow, which takes you back, or you hit the thumb button on your mouse, which in most cases defaults to browser back if you haven’t set it to do something else.\n\n10. My mouse is highlighting text on its own: Click lock\n\nYou move your pointer over to a window, but suddenly the window starts being dragged around, even though your finger’s not on the mouse button. You move the cursor around a document and, all of a sudden, the pointer starts highlighting text. Again, you’re not holding down the mouse button, so what gives? Is there a ghost dragging and highlighting things on your PC?\n\nSomeone has probably enabled Click Lock, a feature that makes Windows act as if you are holding down the mouse button after you’ve just clicked one time. This is a useful accessibility feature for someone with a sore clicking finger, but is a nightmare for most people.\n\nTo disable Click Lock, navigate to the old Control Panel->Mouse. Then uncheck “Turn on Click Lock.”\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n11. My WASD keys turned into arrow keys: Fn + W\n\nNow, here’s a nightmare feature that a few keyboards have and it’s not widely advertised. You start typing and notice that when you hit W, A, S or D (the WASD keys), they act as arrows, not as letters. The arrow keys act as W, A, S and D.\n\nOn a few modern gaming keyboards, hitting Fn + W swaps the arrow and WASD keys. This is probably supposed to help left-handed gamers, but it just leads to nightmares. If this happens to you, hit Fn + W to bring the setting back to normal.\n\n12. My bookmarks bar disappeared: CTRL + Shift + B\n\nI depend on the bookmarks bar in Chrome, the set of bookmarks that appears below the address bar / toolbar. That’s where I put shortcuts to very important tools such as my Gmail inbox, our CMS. or the Tom’s Hardware editorial calendar. Sure, the bar takes up a few pixels of vertical real estate, but it’s worth every single dot.\n\nIf you use the bookmarks bar in Chrome or another browser and one day it just disappears, be sure to hit CTRL + Shift + B to make it appear again."}

On the bright side the returns have been quite good over the last half decade. It has returned a market beating 92% in that time.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Siegfried Holding achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 23% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 14% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nSWX:SFZN Earnings Per Share Growth April 13th 2025\n\nWe know that Siegfried Holding has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Siegfried Holding will grow revenue in the future.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Siegfried Holding's TSR for the last 5 years was 97%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWhile the broader market lost about 0.03% in the twelve months, Siegfried Holding shareholders did even worse, losing 3.7% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 15% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Siegfried Holding ."}

However, in this article, we decided to focus on its weak financials, as long-term fundamentals ultimately dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Swiss Prime Site's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Swiss Prime Site is:\n\n5.4% = CHF360m ÷ CHF6.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each CHF1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made CHF0.05 in profit.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Swiss Prime Site\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nSwiss Prime Site's Earnings Growth And 5.4% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, Swiss Prime Site's ROE is not much to talk about. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 6.6%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. But Swiss Prime Site saw a five year net income decline of 24% over the past five years. Bear in mind, the company does have a slightly low ROE. So that's what might be causing earnings growth to shrink.\n\nFurthermore, even when compared to the industry, which has been shrinking its earnings at a rate of 10% over the last few years, we found that Swiss Prime Site's performance is pretty disappointing, as it suggests that the company has been shrunk its earnings at a rate faster than the industry.\n\nSWX:SPSN Past Earnings Growth April 13th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Swiss Prime Site's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio , as compared to its industry."}

For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. Nonetheless, only a fool would ignore the risk that a loss making company burns through its cash too quickly.\n\nGiven this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Everest Metals (ASX:EMC) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). First, we'll determine its cash runway by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nHow Long Is Everest Metals' Cash Runway?\n\nA company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. In December 2024, Everest Metals had AU$4.2m in cash, and was debt-free. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through AU$4.6m. So it had a cash runway of approximately 11 months from December 2024. To be frank, this kind of short runway puts us on edge, as it indicates the company must reduce its cash burn significantly, or else raise cash imminently. You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.\n\nASX:EMC Debt to Equity History April 13th 2025\n\nView our latest analysis for Everest Metals\n\nHow Is Everest Metals' Cash Burn Changing Over Time?\n\nEverest Metals didn't record any revenue over the last year, indicating that it's an early stage company still developing its business. Nonetheless, we can still examine its cash burn trajectory as part of our assessment of its cash burn situation. Over the last year its cash burn actually increased by 36%, which suggests that management are increasing investment in future growth, but not too quickly. However, the company's true cash runway will therefore be shorter than suggested above, if spending continues to increase. Admittedly, we're a bit cautious of Everest Metals due to its lack of significant operating revenues. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.\n\nCan Everest Metals Raise More Cash Easily?\n\nSince its cash burn is moving in the wrong direction, Everest Metals shareholders may wish to think ahead to when the company may need to raise more cash. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn."}

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether ARN Media's current trading price of AU$0.60 reflective of the actual value of the small-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at ARN Media’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nWhat Is ARN Media Worth?\n\nARN Media is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 48.67x is currently well-above the industry average of 22.22x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. Another thing to keep in mind is that ARN Media’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards the levels of its industry peers over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard for it to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.\n\nView our latest analysis for ARN Media\n\nWhat kind of growth will ARN Media generate?\n\nASX:A1N Earnings and Revenue Growth April 13th 2025\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ARN Media. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in A1N’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell?

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Phibro Animal Health Corporation (NASDAQ:PAHC).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Phibro Animal Health is:\n\n7.8% = US$19m ÷ US$247m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Phibro Animal Health\n\nDoes Phibro Animal Health Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Phibro Animal Health has a lower ROE than the average (21%) in the Pharmaceuticals industry classification.\n\nNasdaqGM:PAHC Return on Equity April 13th 2025\n\nThat certainly isn't ideal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. Our risks dashboard should have the 3 risks we have identified for Phibro Animal Health.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nPhibro Animal Health's Debt And Its 7.8% ROE\n\nIt seems that Phibro Animal Health uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 3.06. The combination of a rather low ROE and high debt to equity is a negative, in our book."}

But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Hotel Grand Central Limited (SGX:H18) shareholders, since the share price is down 34% in the last three years, falling well short of the market decline of around 9.7%.\n\nSo let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nOver the three years that the share price declined, Hotel Grand Central's earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. However, we can say we'd expect to see a falling share price in this scenario.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nSGX:H18 Earnings Per Share Growth April 13th 2025\n\nBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here .\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Hotel Grand Central the TSR over the last 3 years was -30%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in Hotel Grand Central had a tough year, with a total loss of 11% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 12%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 4% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Hotel Grand Central ."}

Over the ensuing 48 hours, and after more than 13,000 views, a whopping 26 people liked the project’s inaugural Tweet, and a further seven shared it. But despite such seismic impact, Hot Air is neither the first of its kind and it probably won’t be the last either. And that’s because, no matter how facile an idea is, there is so much Green Blob cash available to fake news and fake research outfits that the movement and its adherents have lost any capacity for reason.\n\nTortoise boast that Hot Air has been developed with an outfit called “C3DS” based at the University of Exeter – which is also home to the ‘Greenpeace Research Laboratories’, or ‘science unit’, the origin of much fake news. The Centre for Climate Communication and Data Science, or C3DS, claims to “improve strategic communications to deliver meaningful action on climate change”, which it supports with “AI and social science research”.\n\nOne of the observations I’ve made of such outfits that now litter UK campuses is that their ideology, and often their corporate benefactors’ names, are written on their doors, and that is manifestly a problem for ‘knowledge producers’ and so-called ‘scholarship’. One of the conceits of academia, perhaps now outmoded, is that the academy was a forum for open debate. But such exclusionary statements aren’t merely barriers to objectivity. An organisation that intends to work to “improve strategic communications” is a communications outfit, not an academic research outfit.\n\nGo to any university’s politics department, for example, and you will find the inevitable surfeit of self-identifying Marxists. But you will often also find their quieter colleagues. Some will be on the social democratic Left. Some will be adherents to the ideas of liberal theorists, such as John Rawls. And there will even be a few conservatives. But a School of Marxism at the University of Wokeshire – that would exclude the social democrats, the Rawlsians and the conservatives, who will not be invited to participate, even if they ever thought to apply. The sign on the door says ‘not welcome’.\n\nAnd so it is with ‘research’ organisations whose missions statements are so clearly aligned to policy agendas and grounded in particular ideological perspectives. But what if academics wanted to research the rights and wrongs of using universities to develop “strategic communications” for political agendas, especially the climate agenda objectively? Well, you might say that they would be free to pursue their research interests from some other part of the campus. But that would assume that the campus is set up for free inquiry. And it isn’t.\n\nC3DS’s co-founder, Dr Saffron O’Neill, for example, was the grantee of £1,654,675 from anonymous ‘philanthropic’ funders in 2023-25. In 2021, she was co-beneficiary of a £6,249,934 “ESRC Climate and Environment Leadership Grant” – public money funnelled through universities to service a political agenda. Between them, O’Neill’s 14 colleagues boast many millions of pounds in funding from green philanthropists and the British taxpayer. And of course, from Octopus Energy. Well, nobody’s going to save the planet with “strategic communications” for free, are they?\n\nBut how effective are these strategic communications? It would appear that the data and the technology have been provided by the Exeter researchers to Tortoise, and at least 26 people think it’s a great idea. But what did they get out of it? I headed over to the “tool” (the preferred term for searchable online databases of this kind) to find out.\n\nThe academics appear to have scraped thousands of tweets and articles since 2021 by authors such as yours truly, each of which has been categorised as “deny”, “delay” or “control”. An example of “deny” is the statement “climate change is not happening”. An example of “delay” is “climate change might be real, but we need to slow down rollout of green policies”. And “control” means statements such as “climate change policies are more about controlling the public than addressing global warming”. You can search for all these statements by author.\n\nThe Daily Sceptic’s climate offerings are included. For example, my article from December, ‘Ed Miliband Triples Down on Energy Suicide’, is categorised as “delay”. In the article, I criticised the Government’s “Clean Power Action Plan”. I argued that the plan is “a rushed policy agenda that clashes with the reality emerging throughout Europe and the UK, in complete defiance of the facts and utterly indifferent to the experience of the country’s industries, businesses and households”.\n\nI can see why someone – perhaps a fan of Miliband and his extremely expensive policy agenda – might want to object to it. But what’s less clear is how a database of tweets and articles, which merely designate each offending text as “deny”, “delay” or “control”, answers any argument in my article or in the thousands of other tweets and articles that C3DS’s AI-bots have scanned.\n\nThe point of such lists seems to be to encourage the kind of midwit that requires his thoughts to be pre-chewed by a higher authority that feels itself to have been traduced by the enumerated miscreants. And Tortoise, which is on that Guardian-Byline Times axis, caters precisely for such an audience.\n\nVery far from “strategic communications” of any consequence, making lists of people you don’t like and filing their work under pejorative categories such as ‘pooh-pooh head’ or ‘smelly bum’ is simply lame. Yet it has become the modus operandi of (fake) news media organisations, (fake) civil society organisations and (fake) research organisations, using public money. Despite the many millions of pounds, and despite their capture of centres of learning, establishment entities apparently have no capacity to hire anyone capable of engaging with critics of their favoured policy agendas.\n\nAnd that’s why the Hot Air project, which will inform nobody of anything, which will change not one single mind, and which stands as a failure of “strategic communication”, is nonetheless worth commenting on. It is a very useful demonstration of how they think. (If thinking is what they do.)\n\nYou can file it under “control”, if you wish – and hello to you, if you came to this article from Hot Air – but doing so does not answer the fact that such half-baked attempts to use technology to classify and monitor critics’ conversations demonstrate the establishment’s total intellectual exhaustion in the face of growing public resentment of governmental intransigence and its inevitable failures.\n\nIn January last year, I reported on a similar project that pro-censorship activists at the Centre for Countering Digital Hate had put together – again, on Green Blob billionaires’ coins. The report, ‘The New Climate Denial‘, had trained an AI to scan the transcripts of YouTube videos published by evil climate deniers (such as yours truly, again). The AI then categorised the transcripts according to a taxonomy of “techniques of climate denial” – larger, perhaps, but ultimately no more sophisticated than C3DS’s, developed by academic-activist psychologist John Cook. “Testing indicates the model is 78% accurate in categorising claims in our dataset,” the report boasted.\n\nNot even a single human had been involved in the slander of 96 climate commentators who stood accused by the AI and its taxonomy of ‘denial’. And it is no surprise to me that the people that populate such institutions have no confidence in themselves to take on our ideas. Because, after 20 years of trying to engage them in critical debate about their secular religion, I have yet to meet a single one of them with anything of consequence between the ears. If you have to get ChatGPT to do your homework, you’re not a student, you’re not a researcher and you’re not an academic. And the same goes for the lame journalism of the Tortoises. Slow indeed it is.\n\nStop Press: Guido reports that Tortoise readership has almost halved in the three months since January. “Analysis of internet traffic on SimilarWeb shows a massive drop in Tortoise readership from 465,560 in January to 242,328 in March. A 48% decline.” And it’s already a loss-making outfit, reporting a loss of £3.8 million for 2023, down only a bit from £4.6 million in 2022. Clearly, the Observer is in safe hands… Perhaps fanatical climatism and witch-hunts of dissenters aren’t what the punters are looking for.\n\nStop Press 2: David Turver tweets that the list actually serves as a handy guide to who’s who in the sceptical world. “A new ‘misinformation’ database produced by Tortoise Media, C3DS and sponsored by Octopus Energy turns into showcase for Net Zero scepticism. Helpfully, you can filter the database by author. Yours truly is the highest ranked UK individual, with US creators like Tom Nelson, Steve Milloy and Alex Epstein topping the list.”\n\n4.9 8 votes Article Rating\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated"}

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Akzo Nobel. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Dodge & Cox with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.4% and 5.0% of the stock.\n\nAkzo Nobel already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Akzo Nobel's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAnd institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 9.5% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 22% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as \"smart money\", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. Hence, if weakness in Akzo Nobel's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.\n\nEvery investor in Akzo Nobel N.V. ( AMS:AKZA ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 55% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Akzo Nobel's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Akzo Nobel\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Akzo Nobel N.V.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own €3.2m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 45% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Akzo Nobel. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Akzo Nobel better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Akzo Nobel (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

The ex-dividend date generally occurs two days before the record date, which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Meaning, you will need to purchase M Winkworth's shares before the 17th of April to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of May.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be UK£0.033 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of UK£0.12 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, M Winkworth has a trailing yield of approximately 6.5% on its current stock price of UK£2.02. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether M Winkworth can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. It paid out 82% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline.\n\nView our latest analysis for M Winkworth\n\nClick here to see how much of its profit M Winkworth paid out over the last 12 months.\n\nAIM:WINK Historic Dividend April 13th 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at M Winkworth, with earnings per share up 9.6% on average over the last five years.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, M Winkworth has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.3% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."}

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad's ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad is:\n\n18% = RM1.1b ÷ RM6.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every MYR1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn MYR0.18 in profit.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad's Earnings Growth And 18% ROE\n\nAt first glance, PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 8.8% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad's moderate 19% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nAs a next step, we compared PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 19% in the same period.\n\nKLSE:PETDAG Past Earnings Growth April 13th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PETDAG?

However, when multiple insiders purchase stock, like in Jupiter Mines Limited's (ASX:JMS) instance, it's good news for shareholders.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nJupiter Mines Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Peter North for AU$88k worth of shares, at about AU$0.17 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than AU$0.15 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.\n\nJupiter Mines insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nSee our latest analysis for Jupiter Mines\n\nASX:JMS Insider Trading Volume April 13th 2025\n\nThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. If investing in lesser known companies is your style, you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nDoes Jupiter Mines Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. From looking at our data, insiders own AU$6.2m worth of Jupiter Mines stock, about 2.1% of the company. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. We consider this fairly low insider ownership.\n\nSo What Do The Jupiter Mines Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nThere haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. We'd like to see bigger individual holdings. However, we don't see anything to make us think Jupiter Mines insiders are doubting the company. While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with Jupiter Mines (including 1 which is a bit concerning) ."}

Iserbyt served as Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), U.S. Department of Education, during the first Reagan Administration, where she first blew the whistle on a major technology initiative which would control curriculum in America’s classrooms.\n\nCharlotte T. Iserbyt, 91 of Dresden, passed away at her home on the afternoon of February 8, 2022. Born in New York on October 26, 1930, she was the daughter of Clifton and Charlotte (Thomson), and the wife of the late Jan Iserbyt.\n\nIserbyt’s father and grandfather were Yale University graduates and members of the Skull and Bones secret society.\n\nIserbyt was a former school board director in Camden, Maine and was co-founder and research analyst of Guardians of Education for Maine (GEM) from 1978 to 2000. She has also served in the American Red Cross on Guam and Japan during the Korean War, and in the United States Foreign Service in Belgium and in the Republic of South Africa.\n\nIserbyt was a speaker and writer, best known for her 1985 booklet Back to Basics Reform or OBE: Skinnerian International Curriculum and her 1989 pamphlet Soviets in the Classroom: America’s Latest Education Fad which covered the details of the U.S.-Soviet and Carnegie-Soviet Education Agreements which remain in effect to this day.\n\nA prolific writer, Ms. Iserbyt authored two books, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America…A Chronological Paper Trail in 1999, which alleges that changes gradually brought into the American public education system work to eliminate the influences of a child’s parents and mold the child into a member of the proletariat in preparation for a socialist-collectivist world of the future. She also wrote three editions of Back to Basics Reform or…OBE*Skinnerian International Curriculum between 1985 and 2003 and Back to Basics Reform, which documents her experiences working in the U.S. Department of Education, where she was privy to past and future plans to restructure American education.\n\nMs. Iserbyt contributed numerous articles to professional journals and newspapers. She was a freelance writer and had articles published in Human Events, The Washington Times, The Bangor Daily News, and included in the record of Congressional hearings.\n\n11:54 pm on April 12, 2025\n\nThe Best of Charles Burris"}

They are making it easier to redeem e-book credits right on the product description page for print books and digital books. Right under the add to cart button is a box, that provides the total number of credits that are owned and simply check mark the box, before adding it to the cart to get a discount for the book.\n\nThe redemption process on the product description page does have its caveats. It has to be done on the Amazon website, which can be accessed on a computer, laptop, phone or tablet. It won’t work on the Kindle Shopping app, Kindle e-reader to any of the Kindle apps for Android or iOS.\n\nAmazon will discontinue the original process of redeeming points from the Kindle Rewards Beta page on May 11th, 2025. The change to Kindle Rewards is a welcome one, it simplifies the process, making it more intuitive to use credits to get discounts on books.\n\nWhat is Kindle Rewards?\n\nLots of people might not be familiar with Kindle Rewards. At its core, US customers earn credits when purchasing print books or e-books. Once 300 credits are attained, it provides a $3.00 discount that can be used on any title on the Amazon bookstore.\n\nCustomers earn 3 Kindle Points per dollar spent on Kindle books and 1 Kindle Point per dollar spent on print books. The amount of points is listed on the Amazon website, right underneath the price. Sometimes, Amazon offers double the points that they announce on social media.

These refinements ensure that the devices remain visually appealing while accommodating the latest technological advancements. The combination of durability and elegance reflects Apple’s commitment to delivering products that are both practical and stylish.\n\nBattery Life: Enhanced Endurance\n\nBattery performance sees meaningful improvements across the iPhone 17 series. The iPhone 17 Air incorporates high-density battery technology, maintaining impressive endurance despite its slim design. On the other hand, the Pro Max model includes a larger battery, slightly increasing the device’s thickness but delivering extended usage times. These enhancements cater to users who rely on their devices for productivity, entertainment, and communication throughout the day, making sure that the iPhone 17 can keep up with even the most demanding schedules.\n\nHardware Upgrades: Seamless and Efficient Performance\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models receive a notable RAM upgrade, increasing to 12 GB to support multitasking and future software demands.

However, by using free resources and automation workflows, you can streamline the process and identify high-quality prospects efficiently. In this guide, AI Agents A-Z walk you through a step-by-step process to streamline your lead generation efforts using tools like n8n, job boards, and LinkedIn data scraping. By combining automation with strategic data collection, you’ll uncover high-quality prospects while saving time and resources. Whether you’re a sales professional, a business owner, or someone looking to scale your outreach, this method offers a practical, ethical, and cost-effective solution to supercharge your prospecting efforts.\n\nAutomated LinkedIn Leads with n8n\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Use job boards like Remotive to identify companies with hiring needs that align with your offerings, forming the foundation of your lead generation workflow.\n\nExtract actionable data from LinkedIn using tools like the Google Custom Search API to gather comprehensive company information, including descriptions, employee counts, and updates.\n\nAggregate and summarize raw data into structured insights using tools like spreadsheets, databases, and LLMs (e.g., OpenAI) to enhance targeting and outreach effectiveness.\n\nCustomize the output for actionable use by integrating data into CRMs, generating personalized LinkedIn messages, or sharing insights with sales teams for follow-up.\n\nAutomate responsibly by incorporating delays to mimic human behavior, adhering to ethical scraping practices, and complying with LinkedIn’s terms of service to avoid detection and maintain trust.\n\n1: Use Job Boards to Identify Sales Opportunities\n\nJob boards are a valuable resource for uncovering sales opportunities. Job postings often indicate hiring budgets, growth initiatives, and potential interest in your product or service. Platforms like Remotive, which provide industry-specific RSS feeds, are particularly effective for gathering relevant data.\n\nFocus on job postings that align with your offerings. For example, if you provide HR software, target companies hiring HR managers or recruiters.\n\nExtract critical details such as job titles, company names, and locations. These details form the foundation of your lead generation workflow.\n\nBy targeting companies actively hiring, you can identify organizations with potential needs that your solution can address. This approach ensures your efforts are directed toward prospects with a higher likelihood of engagement.\n\n2: Extract Actionable Data from LinkedIn\n\nOnce you’ve identified relevant job postings, the next step is to extract actionable data from LinkedIn. Tools like the Google Custom Search API can assist in locating LinkedIn company pages based on the company names collected from job boards.\n\nUse the API to perform precise searches, narrowing down results to the most relevant LinkedIn profiles.\n\nExtract key company information, such as descriptions, employee counts, locations, and recent updates.\n\nIncorporate conditional logic into your workflow to handle incomplete data. For instance, if a company page lacks employee information, the workflow can skip to the next available data point without interruption.\n\nThis step ensures you gather comprehensive and relevant information about your prospects, allowing more informed decision-making during outreach.\n\nLinkedIn leads with n8n without paying\n\nAdvance your skills in LinkedIn lead generation by reading more of our detailed content.\n\n3: Aggregate and Summarize the Data\n\nRaw data becomes valuable only when it is structured and easy to analyze. Aggregating and summarizing the extracted data allows you to transform it into actionable insights.\n\nUse data aggregation tools to compile information into spreadsheets or databases, creating a centralized repository of prospects.\n\nEnhance the data with a Large Language Model (LLM) like OpenAI to generate summaries. These summaries can highlight why a company is a strong prospect, based on factors such as hiring trends or recent updates.\n\nFor example, if a company recently announced plans to expand into new markets, the LLM can summarize this as an indicator of potential interest in solutions that support scaling operations. This process converts raw data into meaningful insights, making your outreach efforts more focused and effective.\n\n4: Tailor the Output for Actionable Use\n\nThe final output of your workflow should be customized to meet your specific needs. Whether you’re sharing data with a sales team or integrating it into a CRM, the goal is to make the information actionable and practical.\n\nSend summarized data via email to stakeholders, such as sales teams or business development managers, for immediate follow-up.\n\nIntegrate the data into a CRM system to ensure it’s readily available for future outreach and tracking.\n\nFor LinkedIn outreach, generate personalized connection requests or messages. Reference a company’s recent achievements or growth plans to make your outreach more compelling and relevant.\n\nTailoring the output ensures that your efforts translate into meaningful engagement with prospects, increasing the likelihood of successful conversions.\n\nStep 5: Automate Responsibly and Ethically\n\nAutomation is essential for scaling this process, but it must be implemented responsibly to avoid detection and maintain ethical standards.\n\nIncorporate loops with wait times into your workflow to mimic human behavior. For example, add delays between scraping actions to reduce the risk of triggering LinkedIn’s bot detection mechanisms.\n\nAdhere to ethical scraping practices by complying with LinkedIn’s terms of service. Avoid collecting sensitive or private data, and prioritize transparency and respect for data privacy.\n\nBy automating responsibly, you can scale your lead generation efforts without compromising trust or facing legal complications. Ethical practices not only protect your business but also foster long-term relationships with prospects.\n\nA Practical and Scalable Approach to LinkedIn Lead Generation\n\nThis workflow provides a practical, scalable, and cost-effective method for generating LinkedIn leads without relying on paid tools. By combining job board scraping, LinkedIn data extraction, and automation tools like n8n, you can create a robust lead generation system. The integration of data aggregation and summarization further enhances the quality of your outputs, allowing more targeted and impactful outreach.\n\nWith careful attention to ethical practices and bot detection avoidance, this approach enables businesses to expand their prospecting efforts efficiently. Whether you’re a sales professional or a business development manager, this workflow equips you with the tools and strategies needed to identify and engage high-quality prospects on LinkedIn effectively.\n\nMedia Credit: AI Agents A-Z\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.
