From detecting fraudulent transactions in financial services to monitoring Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data in manufacturing, or tracking user behavior in ecommerce platforms, streaming analytics enables organizations to make split-second decisions and respond to opportunities and threats as they emerge.\nIncreasingly, organizations are adopting Apache Iceberg, an open source table format that simplifies data processing on large datasets stored in data lakes. Iceberg brings SQL-like familiarity to big data, offering capabilities such as ACID transactions, row-level operations, partition evolution, data versioning, incremental processing, and advanced query scanning. It seamlessly integrates with popular open source big data processing frameworks Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache Flink, Presto, and Trino. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) supports Iceberg tables both directly using the Iceberg table format and in Amazon S3 Tables.\nAlthough Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) provides robust, scalable streaming capabilities for real-time data needs, many customers need to efficiently and seamlessly deliver their streaming data from Amazon MSK to Iceberg tables in Amazon S3 and S3 Tables. This is where Amazon Data Firehose (Firehose) comes in. With its built-in support for Iceberg tables in Amazon S3 and S3 Tables, Firehose makes it possible to seamlessly deliver streaming data from provisioned MSK clusters to Iceberg tables in Amazon S3 and S3 Tables.\nAs a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service, Firehose reads data from your Apache Kafka topics, transforms the records, and writes them directly to Iceberg tables in your data lake in Amazon S3. This new capability requires no code or infrastructure management on your part, allowing for continuous, efficient data loading from Amazon MSK to Iceberg in Amazon S3.In this post, we walk through two solutions that demonstrate how to stream data from your Amazon MSK provisioned cluster to Iceberg-based data lakes in Amazon S3 using Firehose.\nThe following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture to deliver streaming messages from Amazon MSK to Iceberg tables in Amazon S3.\n\nTo follow the tutorial in this post, you need the following prerequisites:\nBefore configuring the Firehose delivery stream, you must verify the destination table available in the Data Catalog.\n\n\nThis ensures Firehose has the necessary permissions on the source Amazon MSK provisioned cluster.\nThis section describes the permissions that grant Firehose access to ingest, process, and deliver data from source to destination. You must specify an IAM role that grants Firehose permissions to ingest source data from the specified Amazon MSK provisioned cluster. Make sure that the following trust policies are attached to that role so that Firehose can assume it:\nMake sure that this role grants Firehose the following permissions to ingest source data from the specified Amazon MSK provisioned cluster:\nMake sure the Firehose role has permissions to the Glue Data Catalog and S3 bucket:\nFor detailed policies, refer to the following resources:\nNow you have verified that your source MSK cluster and destination Iceberg table are available, you\ufffdre ready to set up Firehose to deliver streaming data to the Iceberg tables in Amazon S3.\nComplete the following steps to create a Firehose stream:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo route streaming data to different Iceberg tables and perform operations such as insert, update, and delete, you can use Firehose JQ expressions. You can find the required information here.\n\nWith Firehose, you can configure backup settings by specifying an S3 backup bucket with custom prefixes like error, so failed records are automatically preserved and accessible for troubleshooting and reprocessing.\n\n\n\nThe Firehose stream will be available and it will stream data from the MSK topic to the Iceberg table in Amazon S3.\n\nYou can query the table with Amazon Athena to validate the streaming data.\nYou will be able to access the streaming data in the table.\n\nS3 Tables is built on Iceberg\ufffds open table format, providing table-like capabilities directly to Amazon S3. You can organize and query data using familiar table semantics while using Iceberg\ufffds features for schema evolution, partition evolution, and time travel capabilities. The feature performs ACID-compliant transactions and supports INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations in Amazon S3 data, making data lake management more efficient and reliable.\nYou can use Firehose to deliver streaming data from an Amazon MSK provisioned cluster to Iceberg tables in Amazon S3. You can create an S3 table bucket using the Amazon S3 console, and it registers the bucket to AWS Lake Formation, which helps you manage fine-grained access control for your Iceberg-based data lake on S3 Tables. The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.\n\nYou should have the following prerequisites:\nFurther, in your Firehose role, add s3tablescatalog as a resource to provide access to S3 Table as shown below.\nTo create an S3 table bucket on the Amazon S3 console, refer to Creating a table bucket.\nWhen you create your first table bucket with the Enable integration option, Amazon S3 attempts to automatically integrate your table bucket with AWS analytics services. This integration makes it possible to use AWS analytics services to query all tables in the current Region. This is an important step for the further set up. If this integration is already in place, you can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) as follows:\naws s3tables create-table-bucket --region <region id> --name <bucket name>\n\nAn S3 table namespace is a logical construct within an S3 table bucket. Each table belongs to a single namespace. Before creating a table, you must create a namespace to group tables under. You can create a namespace by using the Amazon S3 REST API, AWS SDK, AWS CLI, or integrated query engines.\nYou can use the following AWS CLI to create a table namespace:\nAn S3 table is a sub-resource of a table bucket. This resource stores S3 tables in Iceberg format so you can work with them using query engines and other applications that support Iceberg. You can create a table with the following AWS CLI command:\naws s3tables create-table --cli-input-json file://mytabledefinition.json\nThe following code is for mytabledefinition.json:\nNow you have the required table with the relevant attributes available in Lake Formation.\nAfter integration, Lake Formation manages access to your table resources. It uses its own permissions model (Lake Formation permissions) that enables fine-grained access control for Glue Data Catalog resources. To allow Firehose to write data to S3 Tables, you can grant a principal Lake Formation permission on a table in the S3 table bucket, either through the Lake Formation console or AWS CLI. Complete the following steps:\nTo set up a Firehose stream to S3 Tables using the Firehose console, complete the following steps:\nFor more information, refer to Route incoming records to a single Iceberg table and Route incoming records to different Iceberg tables.\nThe Firehose stream will be available and it will stream data from the Amazon MSK topic to the Iceberg table. You can verify it by querying the Iceberg table using an Athena query.\n\nIt\ufffds always a good practice to clean up the resources created as part of this post to avoid additional costs. To clean up your resources, delete the MSK cluster, Firehose stream, Iceberg S3 table bucket, S3 general purpose bucket, and CloudWatch logs.\nIn this post, we demonstrated two approaches for data streaming from Amazon MSK to data lakes using Firehose: direct streaming to Iceberg tables in Amazon S3, and streaming to S3 Tables. Firehose alleviates the complexity of traditional data pipeline management by offering a fully managed, no-code approach that handles data transformation, compression, and error handling automatically. The seamless integration between Amazon MSK, Firehose, and Iceberg format in Amazon S3 demonstrates AWS\ufffds commitment to simplifying big data architectures while maintaining the robust features of ACID compliance and advanced query capabilities that modern data lakes demand. We hope you found this post helpful and encourage you to try out this solution and simplify your streaming data pipelines to Iceberg tables.\nPratik Patel is Sr. Technical Account Manager and streaming analytics specialist.
