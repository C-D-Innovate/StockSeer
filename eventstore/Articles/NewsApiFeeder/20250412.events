However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. In this article, we decided to focus on Occidental Petroleum's ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:\n\n8.4% = US$2.9b ÷ US$34b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.\n\nView our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 8.4% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, Occidental Petroleum's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 14% either. Despite this, surprisingly, Occidental Petroleum saw an exceptional 49% net income growth over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nWe then compared Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 38% in the same 5-year period."}

But do these wolf pups really count as the \"world's first de-extinction,\" as the company claims?\n\nThe three pups — Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi — were created by genetically engineering the cells of modern-day gray wolves (Canis lupus). The researchers did this by reconstructing the dire wolf's genome from ancient DNA and identifying 20 key differences between this genetic sequence and that of the gray wolf, which the company says are responsible for the dire wolves' distinguishing characteristics.\n\nHowever, while many are excited by this development, others have remained skeptical . For instance, previous genetic analysis has shown that dire wolves are not actually that closely related to gray wolves, and it is therefore unlikely that just 20 genetic tweaks would be enough to transform a gray wolf genome into that of a dire wolf. Others have questioned how these animals could ever be securely released into the wild as part of conservation efforts without negatively affecting existing animal populations.\n\n3D holograms you can touch\n\nIt's a staple of science fiction: a 3D hologram that we can interact with like a solid object. Now, thanks to a string of breakthroughs in mixed reality technologies, these pioneering projections might be a lot closer to reality.\n\nIn a new study, scientists revealed how using elastic materials in the displays of these holograms can enable them to be grabbed, poked and generally interacted with in a physical way.\n\nWhile the technology is still in its early stages, the team hopes that it will have widespread commercial uses, including in education and entertainment.\n\nDiscover more technology news\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

But in the lowland rainforests of Panama, one tree species may have evolved to use this force of nature to its advantage .\n\nScientists have known for about 10 years that tonka bean trees (Dipteryx oleifera) do not appear to succumb to the damaging blows of lightning strikes. Now, according to research, their incredible lightning resistance may give them an advantage in busy forest canopies — by enabling them to survive direct lightning strikes that kill off their nearby competition.\n\nThe researchers say this is likely down to their large structure and high internal conductivity, enabling lightning current to flow through them without building up damaging heat that would kill most other trees.\n\nDiscover more planet Earth news\n\n— Scientists say these North American rivers 'shouldn't exist.'

This acceleration implied the presence of a mysterious entity that we now know as dark energy .\n\nFor decades, dark energy and its origins have remained elusive. A popular theory suggests that dark energy arises from quantum fluctuations in the vacuum of space. However, when applied to mathematical models, this idea fails to explain the expansion rate of the universe.\n\nNow, scientists have turned to string theory — a quantum theory of gravity that treats elementary particles as tiny, vibrating, one-dimensional objects called strings — to solve this puzzle. These so-called strings give rise to different particles depending on the way they are vibrating, including gravitons — the hypothetical quantum carrier of gravity.\n\nBy basing their calculation on this quantum theory, scientists have determined that space-time itself is inherently quantum in its behavior. And one of the most striking consequences of these assumptions is that they naturally lead to an acceleration of universe expansion.\n\nThe study is still awaiting peer-review, but the authors claim that their model may provide \" the first observational evidence supporting string theory.\"\n\nSomething for the weekend\n\nIf you're looking for something a little longer to read over the weekend, here are some of the best long reads, book excerpts and interviews published this week.\n\n— Scientific research is the lifeblood of our economy.

That’s how large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 start learning.\n\nLLMs use self-supervised learning, meaning they don’t need someone to label or explain the data to them. Instead, they learn by reading vast amounts of text from books, code, academic papers, Wikipedia (and its 57 million+ articles), Reddit forums, and news articles, in addition to billions of others, and then predicting what word comes next in a sentence -- over and over again.\n\nAlthough this may sound simplistic, it is the core of how LLMs can do the amazing things they do. Let’s say the model reads:\n\n“In 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from Spain to ___.”\n\nIt has to guess the next word based on everything it’s seen before. Maybe it says “explore,” “America,” or “discover,” depending on the context. If it gets it right, great; if not, it adjusts, learning how people talk and how ideas like timelines, historical figures, cause and effect, and more relate to one another.\n\nThis next-word prediction task is repeated billions of times during training, using models that can include hundreds of billions of parameters (the “brain cells” of the model). The more examples it sees, the more easily it recognizes language patterns -- grammar, spelling, style, and even humor -- but it doesn’t stop there. Because it learns from data provided by everything from Wikipedia to movie scripts to software documentation, it doesn’t just learn language, but how the world works through language.\n\nLLMs learn much more than just language\n\nEven though the model’s goal is “just” to predict words, it ends up learning a whole lot more.\n\nHow things work\n\nAs humans, we know that “if you drop a glass, it might break” or “If it’s cloudy, it could rain.” But for LLMs, learning this is called a world model -- not just language, but cause and effect and how the world fits together.\n\nHow people think and feel\n\nLLMs can learn to pick up that “I’m fine” might sometimes mean the opposite. It learns tone, emotion, and even sarcasm -- all from how people write.\n\nHow to solve problems\n\nLLMs see many examples of math, logic puzzles, code, and advice columns. Over time, they get better at not just saying things but figuring things out. Some newer models even learn to plan by breaking a tricky question into small steps to solve problems.\n\nHow to use tools\n\nSome LLMs learn how to write computer code or help build spreadsheets, templates, and APIs just by seeing enough examples of how people do those things in writing.\n\nLearning how to learn\n\nThis is called “meta-learning.” For LLMs, this means figuring out what they don’t know -- and how to fix it -- like recognizing their own confusion or need to ask a clarifying question. If it requires more information, it will prompt that it can get a better answer if provided with additional details and ask the user for it. For example: “My response will differ depending on whether this treatment is for children or adults. What age range should I consider?”\n\nThanks to the transformer architecture, LLMs can track relationships between words across long distances in text and do this learning in parallel, much faster than older models. It’s like giving the model access to a giant library and watching it learn how the world works by reading everything inside. That’s what LLMs do, except instead of reading for years, they learn across billions of examples in days or weeks on infrastructure that spans hundreds of processors. So, even though they’re “just predicting words,” they develop generalized human-like cognition -- not real consciousness, but the ability to simulate understanding remarkably well.\n\nNew models that actually “think”\n\nUntil recently, most LLMs were great at sounding smart through pattern recognition, but often struggled with logic, made up (hallucinated) facts, or failed at multi-step reasoning. We’re now in the Reasoning Model Era: new models don’t just guess what to say but think about how to say it and why. These models can:\n\nBreak down complex questions into parts and show intermediate reasoning steps, called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.\n\nLook things up in real time using the internet through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n\nReflect, double-check, and iteratively improve their answers (self-reflection and critique).\n\nExamples of reasoning-first models:\n\nOpenAI’s o1 and o1-pro: Designed for better planning and fewer mistakes.\n\nDesigned for better planning and fewer mistakes. Perplexity’s Sonar Pro-Reasoning: Combines AI with a live internet search to give answers with verifiable sources and logic chains.\n\nCombines AI with a live internet search to give answers with verifiable sources and logic chains.

Google’s Gemini: Can understand text, images, code, and audio -- then connect them.\n\nThese models can break problems into parts, use tools, look up sources, and even revise their own answers -- like a researcher with internet access, memory, and a whiteboard. These advancements move us closer to AI systems that can engage in planning, problem-solving, and even ethical deliberation -- not just mimicry.\n\nThe multilingual and cultural challenge\n\nIf AI will be helpful to everyone, it must understand more than just English or “textbook” English. While LLMs work best for people who speak like the books and articles the model was trained on (over 80 percent of LLM pretraining datasets are English-dominant), this can leave out key demographics of users, including:\n\nSpeakers of Indigenous languages, regional dialects, or languages that don’t have much online data to train on.\n\nPeople who speak in non-standard grammar or slang (e.g., Spanglish, Hinglish).\n\nPeople using assistive communication tools.\n\nNon-Latin scripts (e.g., Arabic, Hindi) that suffer from inefficient text segmentation.\n\nIdioms, metaphors, and customs that don’t always translate directly.\n\nThese are real ways people talk, but they often get left out of AI training. This isn’t just about fairness -- it’s also about performance, as a model that misunderstands what you say can give wrong, biased, or even potentially dangerous advice.\n\nWhat’s next: From language to logic\n\nAI is everywhere. Over 50 percent of content online is now AI-generated, and by the end of this year, over 90 percent of live code will have been generated by AI.\n\nWith the advent of reasoning models, what began as text prediction now touches software engineering, scientific discovery, personal coaching, and even legal drafting and arguments.\n\nYet challenges remain:\n\nHallucination: Even advanced models occasionally generate convincing but false statements.\n\nEven advanced models occasionally generate convincing but false statements. Bias: Models reflect the data they’re trained on, often reinforcing stereotypes or biases.\n\nModels reflect the data they’re trained on, often reinforcing stereotypes or biases. Interpretability: It remains difficult to understand why a model made a given prediction or decision, though reasoning models are getting much better at showing their work.\n\nToday’s LLMs are powerful simulators of thought, learning far more than words -- they internalize logic, context, and human-like reasoning. The shift from fluency to reasoning is real, but to realize their full potential -- ethically and effectively -- as we move into the future, we must ensure they are not just intelligent but trained on robust data (and not just disproportionately on data they themselves generated, as usage expands), provide transparency, multilingual equity, and clearly-grounded factual reasoning grounded in truth. This will help ensure these models continue to improve and serve an increasing number of people without devolving into self-reinforced groupthink.\n\nImage Credit: Wanniwat Roumruk / Dreamstime.com\n\nKeryn Gold, PhD, MBA is Ex-FAANG leader, executive advisor, AI strategist, and author of multiple books, including “The Leadership Playbook, Revisited: How To Accelerate Success, Guide & Empower Your People, Navigate Change, & Build Good AI Habits to Take Control of Your Work Life & Future-Proof Your Career, Today”"}

That order raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 125 percent. Those tariffs of 125 percent remain in place, but reduce the tariff on a broad swath of the PC industry, plus smartphones.\n\nEssentially, it provides relief for PC and component buyers, which has already been plagued by high prices on computers and components.\n\nSpecifically, the order excepts several classifications of products found on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which in turn provides an esoteric textual description pf products imported to the U.S. “In Executive Order 14257, I stated that certain goods are not subject to the ad valorem rates of duty under that order,” Trump’s order states. “One of those excepted products is ‘semiconductors.'”\n\nIn a post on the Truth Social web site on Sunday afternoon, Trump denied that the technology industry was receiving a wholesale exemption. “There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday,” Trump wrote. “These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’”\n\nTrump said that the government would be “taking a look” at semiconductors and the whole electronics supply chain. For now, however, tariffs on the specified products remain at 20 percent.\n\nDetails of the excepted products\n\nOne of the listed subheadings, 8473.30, includes “parts and accessories” of “automatic data processing machines” like computers. Those “parts and accessories” specifically describe memory modules. (In this case, The Trump order lists the subheading as 847330, excluding the decimal point.)\n\nThe list basically includes computers and servers; smartphones; components like motherboards, processors, and memory; monitors; routers and switches; and devices with recorded media upon them, and more. The list also includes category 8542, covering “electronic integrated circuits,” LEDs, and transistors, and machines to produce semiconductors and components.\n\nThough it would appear that the Trump administration totally withdrew tariffs on all of these devices, based upon the “exceptions” the order lists, Trump’s post denies this.\n\nThe entire list of exceptions can be found at the USITC.gov website. The exceptions include the following categories:\n\n8471\n\n847330\n\n8486\n\n85171300\n\n85176200\n\n85235100\n\n8524\n\n85285200\n\n85411000\n\n85412100\n\n85412900\n\n85413000\n\n85414910\n\n85414970\n\n85414980\n\n85414995\n\n85415100\n\n85415900\n\n85419000\n\n8542\n\nTrump’s administration was scheduled to apply a chip tariff of 25 percent to chip imports by April 2, but never did. The president later stated that the chip tariffs would go “substantially higher” over the course of a year.\n\nUnfortunately, a day later Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the tariffs would return. “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” he told host Jonathan Karl of ABC This Week, as quoted by USA Today.\n\nThis story was updated on April 13 at 7:32 PM with additional information."}

Technologies that follow Wright’s Law get cheaper at a consistent rate, as the cumulative production of that technology increases.\n\nTechnologies that follow Wright’s Law get cheaper at a consistent rate, as the cumulative production of that technology increases.\n\nThe best way to explain what this means is to look at a concrete example.\n\nSolar technology: an example of a technology that follows Wright’s Law\n\nThe time series in the chart shows the deployment of solar panels on the horizontal axis and the price of solar panels on the vertical axis. The orange line that describes the relationship between these two metrics over time is called the learning curve of that technology.\n\nDownload image\n\nAs the cumulative installed capacity increased, the price of solar declined exponentially. Solar technology is a prime example. For more than four decades, the price of solar panels declined by 20% with each doubling of global cumulative capacity.\n\nThe fact that both metrics changed exponentially can be nicely seen in this chart because both axes are logarithmic. On a logarithmic axis, a measure that declines exponentially follows a straight line.\n\nThat more production leads to falling prices is not surprising – such ‘economies of scale’ are found in the production of many goods. If you are already making one pizza, making a second one isn’t that much extra work.\n\nWhat is exceptional about technologies that follow a learning curve is that this effect persists, and the rate at which the price declines stays roughly constant. This is what it means for a technology to follow Wright’s Law.\n\nThe relationship between the laws of Gordon Moore and Theodore Paul Wright\n\nSolar power is not the only technology where we see trends of exponential change. The most famous case of exponential technological change is Moore’s Law – the observation of Intel’s co-founder Gordon Moore who noticed that the number of transistors on microprocessors doubled every two years.\n\nWe have another article on Moore’s Law on Our World in Data: What is Moore’s Law?\n\nIntegrated circuits are the fundamental technology of computers, and Moore’s Law has driven a range of changes in computer technology in recent decades – computers became rapidly cheaper, more energy efficient, and faster.\n\nMoore’s Law, however, is not given in the same way that we just looked at for solar prices. Moore’s Law describes technological change as a function of time. In the example of solar technology we looked at price changes not as a function of time, but of experience – measured as the cumulative amount of solar panels that were ever installed.\n\nThis relationship that each doubling in experience leads to the same relative price decline was discovered earlier than Moore’s Law by aerospace engineer Theodore Paul Wright in 1936.1 It’s called Wright’s Law, after him.\n\nMoore’s observation of the progress in computing technology can be seen as a special case of Wright’s Law.2\n\nSolar panels are not the only technologies that follow this law. Look at our visualization of the price declines of 66 different technologies and the research referenced in the footnote3\n\nThe learning rate\n\nThe relative price decline associated with each doubling of cumulative experience is the learning rate of a technology.\n\nThe learning rate of solar panels is 20%. This means that with each doubling of the installed cumulative capacity, the price of solar panels declined by 20%.\n\nIn the footnote, you can find more information about the scientific literature on the learning rate in solar technology, and an example of how the learning rate is calculated.4\n\nThe high learning rate meant that the price of solar declined dramatically. As the chart above showed, the price declined from $106 to $0.38 per watt in these four decades. A decline of 99.6%.\n\nHow is this possible? And is the relationship between experience and price causal?\n\nThat the price of technology declines when more of that technology is produced is a classic case of learning by doing. Increasing production gives the engineers the chance to learn how to improve the process.\n\nThis effect creates a virtuous cycle of increasing demand and falling prices. More of that technology gets deployed to satisfy increasing demand, leading to falling prices. At those lower prices, the technology becomes cost-effective in new applications, which in turn means that demand increases. In this positive feedback loop, these technologies power themselves forward to lower and lower prices.\n\nThe specifics, of course, differ between the different technologies. For more information on what is behind the price reduction of solar panels, see the footnote.5\n\nHow do we know that increasing experience is causing lower prices? After all, it could be the other way around: production only increases after costs have fallen.\n\nIn most settings, this is difficult to disentangle empirically, but researchers François Lafond, Diana Greenwald, and Doyne Farmer found an instance where this question can be answered. In their paper “Can Stimulating Demand Drive Costs Down?”, they study the price changes at a time when reverse causality can be ruled out: the demand for military technology in the Second World War. In that case it is clear that demand was driven by the circumstances of the war, and not by lower prices.6\n\nThey found that as demand for weapons grew, production experience increased sharply, and prices declined. When the war was over and demand shrank, the price decline reverted back to a slower rate. It was the cumulative experience that drove a decline in prices, not the other way around.\n\nWhat can we learn from the learning curve of a technology?\n\nIf you want to know what the future looks like, one of the most useful questions to ask is which technologies follow a learning curve.\n\nMost technologies do not follow Wright’s Law – the prices of bicycles, fridges, or coal power plants do not decline exponentially as we produce more of them. But those which do follow Wright’s Law – like computers, solar panels, and batteries – are the ones to look out for. In their infancy, they might only be found in very niche applications, but a few decades later they are everywhere.\n\nThis means that if you are unaware that a technology follows Wright’s Law, you can get your predictions very wrong. At the dawn of the computer age in 1943, IBM president Thomas Watson famously said, \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\"7 At the price point of computers at the time, that was perhaps perfectly true, but what he didn’t foresee was how rapidly the price of computers would come down. From their initial niche computers expanded to more and more applications, and the virtuous cycle meant that the price of computers declined continuously. The exponential progress of computer technology expanded their use from a tiny niche to the defining technology of our time.\n\nSolar panels are on the same trajectory as we’ve seen before. At the price of solar panels in the 1950s, it would have sounded quite reasonable to say, “I think there is a world market for maybe five solar panels.” But as a prediction for the future, this statement too, would have been ridiculously wrong.\n\nTo get our expectations about the future right, we are well-advised to take the exponential change of Wright’s Law seriously. Doyne Farmer, François Lafond, Penny Mealy, Rupert Way, Cameron Hepburn, and others have done important pioneering work in this field. A central paper of their work is Farmer’s and Lafond’s “How predictable is technological progress?”.8 The focus of this research paper is the price of solar, so that we avoid repeating Watson’s mistake with renewable energy. They lay out in detail what I discussed here: how solar panels decline in price, how demand drives this change, and how we can learn about the future by relying on these insights.\n\nTo get our expectations for the future right, we need to pay particular attention to the technologies that follow learning curves. Initially, we might only find them in a few high-tech applications, but the future belongs to them.\n\nCite this work Our articles and data visualizations rely on work from many different people and organizations.

Ordering starting pitchers is often the most challenging part of that process. Next winter's class has a few of those tricky calls -- perhaps none closer than Zac Gallen versus Michael King.\n\nGallen certainly has the longer track record as an above-average starting pitcher. The righty has started all 146 of his major league appearances. He has been consistently effective, working to a 4.30 ERA or better in all six years (not including this year's 5.28 mark over three starts). Gallen has only once allowed four earned runs per nine in a season. He has punched out at least a quarter of opposing hitters in each year. The result is a 3.33 earned run average with a near-27% strikeout rate in more than 800 career innings.\n\nKing has spent the majority of his big league career working out of the bullpen. The Yankees kept him in long relief for most of his first four seasons. It wasn't until the waning weeks of the 2023 season that they gave him a rotation spot, largely because of injuries elsewhere on the pitching staff. King shined in nine starts, was the centerpiece of San Diego's return for Juan Soto, and had a fantastic first full season as a starter.\n\nOver 173 2/3 frames, he turned in a 2.95 ERA while striking out 27.7% of opposing hitters. He showed no signs of slowing down as he pushed well beyond his previous career-high workload. King managed a 2.15 ERA across 62 2/3 innings after the All-Star Break. He finished seventh in NL Cy Young balloting."}

This Website’s Response Might Matter More.", "fullContent": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollowing President Donald Trump’s announcement of global tariffs during his April 2 “Liberation Day” speech, stock markets around the world plunged sharply. The S&P 500 suffered its most significant one-day drop since the COVID-19 pandemic, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,500 points on back-to-back days, marking the steepest decline in its 127-year history. Then on Wednesday, Trump partially backtracked, pausing certain tariffs for 90 days (with the notable exception of China’s), and the Dow posted its best one-day jump since 2020. But it’s not a total rebound. At the time of reporting, both U.S. and global markets remain significantly down since “Liberation Day,” with investors grappling with the uncertainty of a U.S.-China trade war and its potential damage to the world economy.\n\nAmid the economic upheaval, Wikipedia’s volunteer editors have been diligently chronicling the turbulence on the open-access encyclopedia. Currently, the main Wikipedia entry is titled “2025 stock market crash”; however, there is a prominent note at the top of the page pointing to an ongoing debate about whether the title should be changed to “2025 stock market decline.” The back-and-forth about calling it a crash versus a decline is taking place on the article’s talk page, a forum for editors to deliberate potential edits. So far, the discussion has mostly been a healthy disagreement about how to properly apply Wikipedia’s policies, like using reliable sources and writing from a neutral point of view. This discussion is not nearly as contentious as previous naming disputes such as “Taiwan” versus “Republic of China,” or whether to call Jan. 6 an “insurrection” or an “attack.” But the crash-versus-decline debate reveals some cracks beneath the surface: Editors have starkly different views of what Wikipedia is and how it best serves readers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs with other debates on Wikipedia, there are basically two camps: On one side, we have the archivists, editors who believe that Wikipedia’s role is akin to that of traditional encyclopedias, which only included entries that were thought to have a long-term historical significance. The archivists point to the policy that Wikipedia is not a newspaper that should cover all current events, only those that are truly encyclopedic. Wikipedia’s archivists tend to be rather cautious and conservative about framing. It’s not known yet whether the events of April 2025 will linger in the historical memory like Black Thursday (1929), Black Monday (1987), the Flash Crash (2010), and the COVID-19 crash (2020). The archivists argue that until we have a clearer picture, Wikipedia should refrain from calling this a “crash” because it’s too politically contentious.\n\nStanding opposite of the archivists are the updaters, the Wikipedians who believe the site’s articles should reflect the current media and public framing of significant events. They point to Wikipedia’s explicit policy that it’s not a paper encyclopedia like the days of yore, but rather a digital encyclopedia project. There’s no need to delay changes until some distant future print run; the whole point of a wiki is that you can always make an edit. Quick changes are helpful because the reality is that readers are visiting Wikipedia (or accessing the same info via A.I. tools) because they want information about these events in real time. And it doesn’t matter if the term crash is potentially contentious; if that’s the word being used by contemporary sources, then Wikipedia should follow suit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf it’s not obvious by now, most Wikipedians in the updater camp prefer the word crash, while the archivists lean toward calling it a decline until there’s a broader historical consensus. Reading through the ongoing debate about this nomenclature, it’s striking that what one group takes as totally obvious isn’t necessarily accepted by the other side. Take this exchange from early in the debate: “This is clearly a stock market crash,” wrote one editor, to which another replied, “Says who?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWikipedia’s policy states that its articles should reflect and curate the information that’s published by reliable sources on a topic. That’s why many Wikipedia editors have chimed in with links to articles in Bloomberg, Fortune, Business Insider, and other financial news sites that have specifically used the word crash—That’s who says so, they are arguing. On the other hand, some news outlets have stopped short of calling it a full-blown crash. With Trump’s recent decision to hit pause, it isn’t obvious which description is going to stick. Maybe this incident will be forgotten like so many other seemingly newsworthy events from Trump’s first term. Or this tariff whiplash could likely lead to a recession, which JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon has described as the likely outcome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of recessions, the current debate over how to chronicle this month’s market shocks differs from the 2022 recession discourse. Back then, conservative tweets and media coverage falsely claimed that Wikipedia had altered its definition of “recession” in order to intentionally favor the Biden administration. But the truth was relatively ordinary: For decades, the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research has been considered the authority for defining recession dates in the U.S. During the Biden administration, the NBER did not declare a recession because indicators like employment and consumer spending were still quite strong. Rather than conspiring to help Democrats, Wikipedia editors were simply reflecting the NBER’s definition of the term.\n\nWhen it comes to whether this month’s market turbulence should be called a crash or a decline, there’s no widely accepted authority like the NBER to make the call. Yes, there was a sudden and dramatic drop in stock prices—the standard definition of a crash—but how this drop will be remembered over the long term remains to be seen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy does this debate matter? Because Wikipedia isn’t just a reference site—it’s a living archive that provides information infrastructure to the broader internet. Consumers, investors, journalists, and A.I. models all rely on its language, whether they realize it or not. Even billionaires who claim to hate Wikipedia care a great deal about its content. A single word—crash or decline—can potentially shape both market sentiment and public memory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt press time, Wikipedia editors are still deciding what to call the page, and one intriguing detail is the relatively small group of participants. By my tally, there are only about 40 editors involved. Naturally, there’s always a much larger audience that consumes Wikipedia articles than is willing to engage with the editorial debates about them. Still, considering Wikipedia’s role in writing the “first draft of history,” you might assume there’d be a larger crowd.\n\nThen again, the situation could be worse. While a cohort of 40 Wikipedia editors might not seem substantial, at least it’s not a one-man show."}

Rating: About this rating Fake\n\nIn April 2025, widely shared videos claimed television host Jimmy Kimmel kicked billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, off his late-night show \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Shared by YouTube accounts Visionary Tales and Elite Vault, the videos showed images of Musk and Kimmel along with a voice-over detailing a disagreement they had during the interview.\n\nBoth videos described slightly differing accounts of a purported clash in which Musk accused Kimmel of ambushing him with pointed political questions, and eventually exited the stage.\n\nOne of the videos, uploaded by Elite Vault, had the title \"Jimmy Kimmel Kicks Elon Musk Off His Show - What Happened Next Left America Speechless!\" According to the caption:\n\nWhen Elon Musk appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, no one expected the night to spiral into one of the most talked-about media moments of the year. What began as a casual interview quickly turned tense, with sarcastic jabs and pointed questions that pushed Elon to his limit. Moments later, Kimmel abruptly cut the segment—and Elon was escorted off stage. But the real story didn't air. Within hours, raw footage from backstage surfaced online. It wasn't edited, filtered, or framed — it was honest. That short clip lit a fire across the country, triggering a wave of support, controversy, and conversations that mainstream media didn't see coming.\n\nA video from Visionary Tales stated:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Elon Musk and Jimmy Kimmel engage in a tense exchange during a talk show appearance. What began as a casual conversation quickly escalates into a heated moment that leaves the audience stunned. This fictional scenario imagines what could happen when strong personalities clash on live TV. Watch the full video to see how it unfolds.\n\nThe longer video on Elite Vault described an encounter after Musk walked off the stage and apparently called out Kimmel backstage, leaving the host \"squirming.\"\n\nHowever, both videos are fictional accounts. They originate from YouTube channels known from posting fictional stories and also have disclaimers at the bottom of each caption. As such, we rate this claim as fake.\n\nThe Elite Stories video caption stated: \"The stories presented on this channel are entirely fictional and crafted solely for entertainment. Any resemblance to real events, individuals, or situations is purely coincidental and unintentional. These narratives are not intended to depict, reference, or represent any actual occurrences, persons, or entities.\"\n\nThe caption under Visionary Tales also had a disclaimer: \"This video is a fictional story created for entertainment purposes only. Any resemblance to real persons, events, or situations is purely coincidental.\"\n\nKimmel has often poked fun at Musk on his show. In March 2025, after Kimmel joked about how Tesla vehicles were being vandalized around the country, Musk called him an \"unfunny jerk.\"\n\nThese videos follow a pattern carried out by similarly named YouTube channels, such as Elite Stories, that concoct elaborate fictional tales about public figures, often depicting them in a heroic or inspiring light. We have previously covered the fake story of how Musk allegedly transformed \"The Progressive Bean\" cafe in San Francisco into \"a groundbreaking sustainable technology hub\" after he was refused service there.\n\nSnopes has debunked similar YouTube videos with fake stories about prominent individuals like Musk and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, as well as clips that used AI technology for audio or visuals. We have published a series of articles to help people identify that type of media."}

Trump, by contrast, mostly showed up late to work and watched cable news all day. Had the coronavirus not emerged as a global threat, he might have made it through his first term having not felt the pressure of the job at all. In his second term, it should be the task of liberals to force Trump to swallow a daily spoonful of the very real job stress that Obama struggled so mightily to endure.\n\nTo get there, liberals need to get into the business of identifying the problems that real Americans face (which honestly, is something they could stand to relearn how to do) and more forcefully blame Trump for those problems’ continued existence. They need to raise a hue and cry over everything under the sun that’s broken, dysfunctional, or trending in the wrong direction; pile line items on Trump’s to-do list, wake him up early and keep him up late. Every day, get in front of cable news cameras and reporters’ notepads with a new problem for Trump to solve and fresh complaints about the work not done.\n\nWhat pitfalls lie ahead? It looks like there will be rough economic headwinds in the form of a potential housing crisis and a labor shortage, for starters; another potential public health crisis looms in the form of bird flu (and probably his own Health and Human Services secretary). There is a real possibility of a market-slaying tech-bubble burst on the medium-term horizon as well. There will also be pitfalls that arise from Trump’s own policies, beginning with the fact that his mass deportation scheme will likely torch the domestic economy. Beyond that, there will be the typical crises of American life—economic predators, polluters, corporate scofflaws, and public health concerns—that Trump has either shown no interest in helping abate or has personally empowered via the decisions of his plutocratic-minded Supreme Court appointments. Democrats should already be planning to hang all the foreseeable albatrosses around his neck, and gaming out how they’ll swiftly nail Trump to the wall for the crises that catch him by surprise."}

What initially appeared to be an exciting opportunity for the 19-year-old has now become a tale of unrealised potential, leaving both the player and the club frustrated.\n\nSunderland’s Hopes for Danns Dashed\n\nDanns arrived at Sunderland in January with a growing reputation following an impressive FA Cup performance. The Black Cats, buoyed by his potential, were eager to see the striker play a pivotal role in their promotion push. Fans and staff alike had high hopes for the young forward, expecting him to bring energy and skill to their attack. However, things have not gone according to plan.\n\nWhile Danns was identified as a promising talent, an underlying back injury was flagged up during his medical examination. Despite this concern, Sunderland proceeded with the loan deal, hoping that Danns could recover and contribute to the team’s aspirations. Unfortunately, that hope has not materialised.\n\nInjury Forces Danns Out for the Season\n\nIn an unfortunate twist, the injury that had initially raised concerns has prevented Danns from making any significant impact at Sunderland. Manager Régis Le Bris confirmed in a press conference that Danns will not play for the club again this season, effectively ending his loan before it ever truly began.\n\n“He won’t play with us this season, it is definitive now,” Le Bris stated, crushing any remaining hopes of a late cameo appearance as Sunderland approaches the playoff stages. The injury, coupled with Danns’ extended recovery period, means that his time at Sunderland has been nothing short of a disappointment.\n\nLost Opportunity for Jayden Danns\n\nWhat was meant to be an invaluable opportunity for Danns to gain experience in senior football and prove himself at a higher level has turned into a missed chance. Reports indicate that Danns has spent much of his time away from Sunderland, staying in Liverpool for recuperation, and has barely set foot in his loan club.\n\nIt is undoubtedly a difficult time for the young striker, whose hopes of featuring in competitive football this season have been dashed. The injury seems to have been an unfortunate blow to his development, leaving him with little to show for his time at Sunderland.\n\nExpert Analysis: The Gamble of the Loan Move\n\nSky Sports pundit and former Aston Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie shared his thoughts on the situation, describing it as a “disappointment” for both parties involved. He remarked, “I think he would’ve been a real good addition to that side, they’ve got some very good young players and he would’ve fitted in nicely.” However, Hendrie also acknowledged the inherent risk involved in the loan move, especially given Danns’ injury concerns.\n\n“Anyone going there unfit, struggling with little niggles, is always a gamble and it hasn’t paid off unfortunately,” Hendrie added. The loan was indeed a risk from the start, with Danns’ fitness issues proving too much to overcome, leaving Sunderland and Liverpool to reassess their plans for the future."}

It was seismic. A club-defining moment that immediately sent ripples through Anfield and far beyond. As Andy Robertson told liverpoolfc.com, “A massive player, a massive personality within our changing room, has been crucial to what we’ve done this season and many seasons before that.”\n\nRobertson, speaking openly and warmly, painted the picture best: “I’ve just walked by him there and he has a big smile on his face.” That smile says it all. Liverpool’s talisman isn’t just staying; he’s thriving, energised, and hungry.\n\nAt 32, Salah might be entering the latter stages of his career, but his numbers in the 2024–25 season suggest otherwise: 32 goals, 17 assists, 45 appearances. These aren’t just strong statistics—they’re title-challenging, legacy-building numbers.\n\nGolden Boot, Playmaker, Legend\n\nSalah is already Liverpool’s third-highest goalscorer of all time, but it’s not just history he’s chasing—he’s actively shaping Liverpool’s present. The Egyptian is on course for his fourth Premier League Golden Boot and possibly a second Playmaker award. The idea that a player of his calibre is still delivering career-best numbers shows why his renewed commitment is being hailed as monumental.\n\nRobertson emphasised it further: “He’s our main man, he’s our talisman… the most goals, the most assists… the most creative player for us on the park this season especially.”\n\nIn an era where players often seek new challenges, Salah choosing to extend his Anfield stay speaks volumes about the club’s environment, its direction under Arne Slot, and the unity that still pulses through the dressing room.\n\nTitle Race Alive and Kicking\n\nThis isn’t just about sentimentality or loyalty—this is about Liverpool’s ambitions. Salah’s continued presence ensures the Reds remain at the top of the food chain. His 27 direct goal involvements in the Premier League this season have helped Arne Slot’s Liverpool edge ahead in a closely contested title race.\n\nSalah’s form, confidence and commitment could be the edge the Reds need as they prepare to face West Ham United, a side they’ve already beaten twice this season with five goals each time. But Robertson, ever the pragmatist, isn’t getting carried away: “I don’t think the previous game has any bearing on this game. [There is] a new manager, a new look, a new way of playing for West Ham.”\n\nWith Graham Potter at the helm for the Hammers, Liverpool will need to be sharp. But one thing’s for certain—having Salah on the pitch and in high spirits is a massive advantage.\n\nSlot’s Strategy Made Stronger by Stability\n\nNew manager Arne Slot has had the tricky task of following in the legendary footsteps of Jürgen Klopp. But keeping Salah in the building makes that transition much smoother. The Dutchman can now rely on a proven leader, a world-class finisher, and a mentor for Liverpool’s younger stars.\n\nContinuity is critical, especially when embarking on a new era, and Salah’s contract sends a message not just to rivals, but to potential signings: this project has legs.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nIt’s impossible not to feel euphoric. Mo Salah staying at Liverpool? That’s the stuff fans dream about, especially in this post-Klopp phase where uncertainties loomed large. We’ve had legends leave before—Suárez, Coutinho, even Firmino—but this time, the story flips. Salah isn’t chasing the sunset. He’s choosing Anfield. Again.\n\nSeeing the smile on his face, as Robertson so casually mentioned, feels symbolic. It’s as if Salah knows this season could be special—another Premier League crown, more individual accolades, and, who knows, maybe a Champions League run to remember?\n\nAnd let’s be honest—without Mo, none of this would feel quite as possible.\n\nFor Arne Slot, this is gold dust. A player who not only scores and creates but buys into the club’s vision. Salah is now the bridge between eras—the heart of Klopp’s dynasty and the spearhead of Slot’s revolution.\n\nHe’s more than numbers. He’s Liverpool’s icon, and now he’s here to stay."}

After months of speculation and tense negotiations, Salah signed a two-year contract extension, ensuring his place at Anfield until at least 2027. The saga, which has been anything but straightforward, reflects both the player’s value and the club’s calculated approach to long-term planning.\n\nLong and Complex Negotiations\n\nThe process of negotiating Salah’s new contract has been a drawn-out affair, spanning nearly a year. It has involved complex discussions between Salah’s representative, Ramy Abbas, and Liverpool’s sporting director, Richard Hughes. Though the public announcement was met with widespread relief, the behind-the-scenes drama was anything but smooth. Salah’s relationship with Liverpool had grown increasingly strained during the negotiations, especially as he felt that the club was not fully recognising his status as one of the world’s elite players.\n\n“Salah and Abbas understood he was only ever going to get paid for what he might achieve in the future but they wanted to maintain his position as one of the best-paid in the world,” explained The Athletic. This sentiment became a key issue in the talks, with Abbas striving to secure a deal that would reward Salah for his sustained excellence while keeping him firmly in the upper echelons of the football wage hierarchy.\n\nFinancial Discrepancies and FSG’s Approach\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of the negotiations was ensuring that Salah’s new contract did not disrupt Liverpool’s notoriously disciplined wage structure. The club’s owners, Fenway Sports Group (FSG), have always prioritised financial sustainability, and this principle was non-negotiable during the contract talks. As a result, while Salah’s new deal is undoubtedly lucrative—reportedly making him the second-highest-paid player in the Premier League—it also reflects Liverpool’s ongoing commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline.\n\n“FSG’s money was ultimately Gordon’s, and he would be the one signing off any deal,” The Athletic noted, reflecting the careful scrutiny placed on every aspect of the negotiation. While there was no suggestion of a pay cut for Salah, FSG was keen to ensure that any offer made was sustainable and aligned with the club’s broader financial goals.\n\nEmotional and Professional Balance\n\nFor Salah, the decision to extend his stay at Anfield was not merely a financial one. His connection to the club, its fans, and his family played a significant role in his eventual commitment. “Salah thought the best years of his career were still to come,” The Athletic shared, noting that the forward’s desire to remain at the pinnacle of world football was central to his negotiations.\n\nHowever, the emotional aspect was also crucial. Abbas, who has represented Salah since his early days at Liverpool, was tasked with navigating the delicate balance between securing the best possible deal for his client and ensuring that Salah’s legacy at Anfield was preserved. The relationship between Salah, his agent, and the club has always been professional, with both parties recognising each other’s value.\n\nArne Slot’s Role and Future Prospects\n\nWhat became clear throughout the contract saga was the respect Salah has for Liverpool’s current manager, Arne Slot. Salah’s form this season, including crucial goals and assists, has been instrumental in Liverpool’s success, and Slot’s leadership has only reinforced the forward’s belief in the club’s ambitions. “Salah has embraced the responsibility that comes with being part of the club’s leadership group,” The Athletic reported, highlighting Salah’s positive influence on the team and his role as a mentor to younger players.\n\nWith Salah’s future now secure, Liverpool can focus on building a squad capable of challenging for trophies both domestically and in Europe. Slot’s vision for the club, combined with Salah’s unwavering commitment, offers hope that the team will continue to thrive in the coming seasons.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs Liverpool fans, the news of Mohamed Salah’s contract extension is undoubtedly a cause for celebration. The club’s ability to secure Salah’s future for another two years speaks volumes about both his continued importance to the team and Liverpool’s strategic approach to player retention. It’s clear that Salah has remained at the top of his game, and there is no reason to doubt his ability to continue delivering for the club over the next few years.\n\nHowever, the negotiation process has highlighted some of the challenges Liverpool faces in balancing financial prudence with the need to retain elite talent. FSG’s approach to maintaining a sustainable wage structure is admirable, but it’s equally important that the club does not allow these principles to stand in the way of keeping players of Salah’s calibre. In the future, the club may have to adopt a more flexible approach to wages if it hopes to remain competitive in a world where financial powerhouses like Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain dominate.\n\nUltimately, Salah’s extension not only ensures that Liverpool retains one of the world’s best players but also sends a strong message to the rest of the football world: Liverpool is a club committed to success and will do whatever it takes to keep its stars at the heart of its ambitions. Fans will be hoping that this deal will serve as the foundation for further successes, both on and off the pitch."}

As reported by Anfield Watch, Liverpool’s interest in the 21-year-old French forward has taken “a giant step forward” following developments surrounding Newcastle United’s Alexander Isak.\n\nNewcastle’s firm stance on Isak’s availability – or rather, the lack thereof – has narrowed Liverpool’s options in their search for a long-term number nine. According to The Daily Mail, “transfer chief and agents” expect Isak to stay put at St. James’ Park. That shift has turned all eyes towards Ekitike, who now sits comfortably as Liverpool’s top attacking target.\n\n“He’s now quite comfortably the best option the Reds have up top and we imagine they’ll push a lot harder on a deal now,” wrote Anfield Watch.\n\nWhy Liverpool Need a New Striker\n\nWith Arne Slot set to begin his tenure at Anfield, an overhaul of the forward line appears inevitable. Diogo Jota and Darwin Núñez have both been linked with exits, and though neither departure is confirmed, the club are preparing for all scenarios.\n\nLiverpool’s recruitment team have cast a wide net, considering the likes of Liam Delap and Jonathan David. Delap’s £30m release clause could make him an attractive domestic option, while David’s expiring contract at Lille may offer exceptional value. But when it comes to long-term potential and high-ceiling development, Ekitike is rapidly emerging as the standout.\n\nAnfield Watch state: “Ekitike hasn’t quite hit those heights but he’s also four years younger than Isak. He’s got every chance to become as good as the Swede.”\n\nIt’s a significant observation. Ekitike may not be as polished as Isak, but his trajectory is one that could fit perfectly into Liverpool’s evolving squad under a new manager with a fresh tactical blueprint.\n\nFinancial Sense Behind the Move\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of the potential Ekitike deal is its financial prudence. While Newcastle’s valuation of Isak is pushing nine figures, Ekitike would cost “nearly £100m less.” That kind of saving could be critical to Liverpool’s broader transfer strategy this summer, especially as they aim to reinforce in other key areas.\n\n“Ekitike is a phenomenal talent and one who could lead the line for Liverpool for many years to come,” the report concludes – and at a fraction of the cost, this seems like one of the smartest investments on the table.\n\nTiming Could Be Everything\n\nWith the transfer window edging closer, Liverpool must act swiftly to secure their top target. The longer they delay, the more likely rival interest could complicate negotiations. Ekitike, currently owned by Paris Saint-Germain and having spent time on loan at Eintracht Frankfurt, will have suitors.\n\nHowever, the opportunity for regular football at Anfield under a progressive coach like Arne Slot could prove a persuasive factor. If Liverpool can align on personal terms and navigate the final negotiations with PSG, a deal could materialise in the early stages of the window.\n\nLiverpool fans are used to seeing potential blossom into superstardom. If Ekitike is indeed the next name through the doors at the AXA Training Ground, he will arrive not only with pressure – but with a golden chance to carve out a lasting legacy.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nIt’s impossible not to feel a bit intrigued by this potential move for Hugo Ekitike. On paper, he’s got everything Liverpool fans want in a new striker: youth, mobility, flair, and that hint of unpredictability that’s often the mark of a special player.\n\nOf course, comparisons to Alexander Isak are inevitable. Isak’s 2024 campaign has been nothing short of electric – but Ekitike being “four years younger” makes a world of difference in a long-term rebuild. With Arne Slot stepping in, the next era of Liverpool will need fresh legs and new focal points, especially up front. If Darwin Nunez or Diogo Jota are sacrificed to raise funds, fans will want more than just a replacement. They’ll want promise. Excitement. A reason to believe.\n\nWhat makes this move even more appealing is the cost. Signing a high-upside forward for significantly less than Isak or other top-tier names allows the club to spread investment elsewhere – maybe a centre-back, or a midfield destroyer to add balance. And let’s not forget, Liverpool’s best modern-era transfers (Salah, Mane, Robertson) weren’t marquee signings at the time.\n\nYes, Ekitike hasn’t had a world-beating season yet. But neither did Sadio Mane before he arrived from Southampton. Sometimes the smartest signings are the ones that grow into the role. If Slot and the recruitment team believe in his potential, then fans should be excited about what’s coming next."}

Dave Hendrick Thinks It’s Possible\n\nMohamed Salah’s recent contract extension with Liverpool has reignited debate among supporters and pundits alike about the Egyptian’s long-term legacy at the club. On the Daily Red podcast from Anfield Index, host Dave Hendrick delivered a numbers-heavy, evidence-backed assessment of Salah’s record-breaking trajectory—and made the bold claim that Ian Rush’s legendary goal tally is “in play”.\n\nSalah’s Scoring Feats Show No Signs of Slowing\n\nWith 243 goals already in a Liverpool shirt, Salah sits third in the club’s all-time scorers list, behind only Roger Hunt (285) and Ian Rush (346). But Hendrick firmly believes the door remains open for Salah to reach the summit.\n\n“Let’s say he can do the same next year and gets 30-plus goals,” Hendrick posited. “And let’s say the following season there is a bit of a drop-off and he lands at 25, 20. That’s 50 plus the remainder of this season. There is a real possibility that at the end of this contract… Mo is 40, 45, less than 50 goals behind Ian Rush.”\n\nAnd the motivation? Hendrick doesn’t doubt it: “We know he has an obsession with numbers and records and statistics.”\n\nConsistency Is Salah’s Greatest Asset\n\nWhat sets Salah apart is not just talent, but remarkable consistency. “Four of the last five seasons—30 or more goals,” Hendrick highlighted. “It’s not like he’s put up a 50 and a 45 and a 60. He’s not doing what Cristiano and Messi were doing. He’s putting up a consistent level.”\n\nEven Salah’s so-called “down” seasons make headlines. “That 25 includes AFCON, an injury, and the worst run of form we’ve seen Mo have in a red shirt,” Hendrick reminded listeners, yet it still ranks among elite-level returns.\n\nAssist Records in Reach, Too\n\nBeyond goals, Salah’s creative contributions place him among the Premier League’s finest. He currently sits 10th in all-time assists with 86. “It’s a certainty that he would pass Steven Gerrard, David Silva, Dennis Bergkamp,” said Hendrick. “If he adds 20 more over the next two years, he’d be fourth all-time.”\n\nAt Liverpool specifically, Salah is poised to surpass Steven Gerrard’s Premier League assist record of 92, with 85 already to his name. In all competitions, he currently ranks sixth with 109, and could well reach the top three by overtaking Ian Callaghan (130) and Billy Liddell (132).\n\nSalah’s Legacy: Chasing Greatness\n\nSalah already holds one of the most impressive records in the Premier League era: “Third all-time for the most goal involvements for a single side in the Premier League,” Hendrick noted, trailing only Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs. With 267 involvements in 281 appearances, Salah is doing what others achieved in hundreds more games.\n\nEven the previously unthinkable now feels tangible. “Rush’s record is in play for Mo,” Hendrick asserted. “It might take him staying until he’s aged 37 or 38… maybe breaking it as a squad player.”\n\nAnd if Salah does fall short of Rush’s 346? Hendrick still believes he’ll end his Anfield career among the pantheon. “Second all-time in goals for Liverpool? Very possible. Top three for assists? Likely. Premier League top three scorer and assister? Absolutely.”\n\nThe contract is signed. The fire is burning. The record books are wide open."}

While their influence on the pitch has never been in doubt, their renewed commitment to the club — confirmed by Fabrizio Romano on the Here We Go Podcast — sends a clear message: Liverpool are not just planning for stability, they are positioning themselves to contend at the very highest level under Arne Slot.\n\nSalah Stays: More Than a Contract\n\nRomano was emphatic in his analysis: “It’s a big day and a big moment for the club and they have always been confident in getting it done.” That Liverpool managed to tie down Salah until 2027, in the face of lavish Saudi interest and persistent PSG rumours, reflects the gravity of the project unfolding at Anfield.\n\n“The Saudi project offered huge money, not the £1billion that they wanted to offer to Vinicius Jr., but it was close to that,” Romano revealed, lifting the veil on the magnitude of temptation facing the Egyptian forward. That he rejected it speaks volumes not just of his loyalty, but of his belief in Liverpool’s trajectory under their new manager.\n\nIn truth, this is about more than just numbers. Salah’s £350,000+ per week salary (as widely reported) is substantial, yet fully justified. As Romano put it, “It’s an important contract for Salah in terms of salary, which is well-deserved because he is one of the best players in the world.” Slot’s early impact evidently played a decisive role: “Salah may have considered this back in September or October but once he saw the impact of Arne Slot, he knew he wanted to stay.”\n\nThat final point can’t be overlooked. For all of Klopp’s legacy, Liverpool’s continued pulling power now lies with how convincingly Slot has navigated this transitional phase.\n\nVan Dijk’s Loyalty Reaffirmed\n\nThe narrative around Van Dijk in recent months has veered dangerously close to a tabloid fantasy — with PSG links and whispers of a Saudi exodus. Romano cut through the noise: “Again despite the rumours of PSG, Van Dijk always wanted to stay at Liverpool.”\n\nThis isn’t a sentimental decision. It’s tactical. Leadership, composure, and consistency are in short supply in modern football, and Van Dijk remains the cornerstone of Liverpool’s defence. As Romano added: “Virgil also received a proposal from Saudi Arabia but he remained committed to the project.” In an era where world-class players are lured by extravagant wages and shorter seasons, Van Dijk’s choice speaks to a cultural depth that Liverpool have preserved through the Slot-Hughes reboot.\n\nOther Updates: Trent, Konaté, and Huijsen\n\nThe rebuild doesn’t end with the old guard. Liverpool are actively laying foundations across the board, with Romano offering updates that will intrigue fans and analysts alike.\n\nOn Konaté: “This year, Liverpool had to focus on the other contracts but they are now working on a contract for Konaté. They want to keep him, they love him and talks are happening. Liverpool remain confident.” The Frenchman, still only 25, represents the future of Liverpool’s backline. Retaining him is not just prudent — it’s essential.\n\nMeanwhile, the saga surrounding Trent Alexander-Arnold hints at an emotional crossroads for many supporters. Romano’s insight is sobering: “Let’s wait for the formal steps from the two clubs before we consider it is done, but what we know so far is that Trent wants to go to Real Madrid.” It would be a blow, emotionally and tactically. But with careful squad planning and clarity around contract renewals, Liverpool are better placed than ever to withstand such a departure.\n\nOn the recruitment front, interest in Dean Huijsen from AFC Bournemouth underlines Liverpool’s future-facing vision. Romano confirmed: “I’m not surprised by these stories and I can confirm that Liverpool are considering Dean Huijsen and he does have that £50million release clause.” Real Madrid are also monitoring him — and if Liverpool are operating in the same talent space as Los Blancos, that’s a good sign of intent.\n\nSlot’s Stamp is Already Visible\n\nCredit where it’s due: the Arne Slot era is less about revolution and more about intelligent evolution. With Richard Hughes joining as sporting director, Liverpool have reinforced the leadership structure behind the scenes. Romano summarised it best: “They chose to go with Arne Slot, who has done a brilliant job and they also brought in Richard Hughes as sporting director.”\n\nFrom the outside, it may appear that Liverpool are simply extending key players’ contracts. But viewed through the prism of succession planning, culture retention, and tactical flexibility, these moves are anything but ordinary. As Romano concluded: “What they have done with Salah and Van Dijk is special and now they’re going to win the Premier League title – congratulations.”\n\nThat final sentiment might be ambitious — but it’s not unthinkable. If anything, Liverpool’s decisive moves off the pitch now match the fluid dynamism we’ve grown used to seeing on it. Under Slot, Liverpool are no longer just surviving the post-Klopp transition. They are thriving within it."}

The club has secured contract extensions for both Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk, effectively quelling speculation around their futures and providing a sense of stability at the back and up front. However, one crucial player’s future remains uncertain, and that is Ibrahima Konate.\n\nKonate’s Negotiations: A Financial Dilemma for Liverpool\n\nIbrahima Konate’s future at Anfield has become one of the most pressing matters on Liverpool’s agenda, with negotiations surrounding his contract extension hitting a significant roadblock. The 25-year-old French defender’s representatives have reportedly demanded a £200,000 weekly wage, a substantial increase from his current £80,000 salary. As Fabrizio Romano explained in his GIVEMESPORT newsletter, the club has now shifted its focus to Konate’s contract talks following the resolution of Salah and van Dijk’s extensions.\n\n“Now the priority was obviously Salah and Van Dijk, but the next one could be Konate as Liverpool are working on it,” Romano wrote. The issue with Konate’s wage request has been particularly challenging for Liverpool, a club renowned for maintaining a strict wage structure. This makes the £200,000 demand a potential point of contention, testing the fiscal discipline that has been a hallmark of Liverpool’s transfer strategy in recent years.\n\nSalah and Van Dijk: Completed Deals Bring Stability\n\nLiverpool fans can breathe a sigh of relief as the club has successfully negotiated extensions for two of its most influential players. Mohamed Salah, whose previous contract was set to expire in 2025, has signed a two-year deal that will keep him at Anfield until 2027. The Egyptian forward’s form this season, which includes 27 Premier League goals and 17 assists in 31 appearances, underscores why securing his future was paramount for the club. Salah’s new deal, reportedly worth £480,769 per week with bonuses, represents a considerable upgrade on his previous contract, reflecting his importance to the club’s continued success.\n\nVirgil van Dijk, Liverpool’s captain, is also set to extend his stay at Anfield. Romano confirmed that the agreement for a two-year extension is “done,” and an official announcement is expected imminently. These extensions ensure that Liverpool’s spine remains intact, but with the focus now on Konate, the club’s defence could soon be looking at another potential shift.\n\nStalemate That Could Open the Door to Europe’s Giants\n\nAs discussions with Konate’s camp continue, Liverpool finds itself at a crossroads. The £200,000 wage demand places a strain on the club’s financial policies, and Konate’s reluctance to sign may stem from more than just money. Analysts speculate that Konate is waiting to see the outcomes of Salah, van Dijk, and Trent Alexander-Arnold’s contracts before committing his future to the club. With two of the ‘Contract Trio’ now resolved, Konate may feel more inclined to make a decision about his long-term future at Anfield.\n\nHowever, time is of the essence. As Romano noted, both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are closely monitoring the situation, ready to act if the negotiations fail to make progress. Should Liverpool be unable to meet Konate’s financial demands, they could lose one of their most promising defenders to one of Europe’s heavyweights.\n\nConclusion: The Financial Crossroads for Liverpool\n\nIbrahima Konate’s contract saga is one that Liverpool cannot afford to ignore. The club’s strict wage structure has been a key component in maintaining a balanced squad, but it may be tested by Konate’s wage demands. Liverpool fans will be hoping that, with the clarity surrounding Salah and van Dijk’s contracts, Konate can be convinced to remain at Anfield for the foreseeable future. However, with the looming threat of rival clubs circling, Liverpool’s negotiation with the Frenchman may very well determine the future direction of their defence.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs Liverpool fans the news surrounding Ibrahima Konate’s contract talks is undeniably concerning. Konate has been one of the club’s most exciting defensive prospects in recent years, forming a formidable partnership with Virgil van Dijk at the heart of the defence. To lose him due to financial disagreements would be a blow to Liverpool’s long-term ambitions.\n\nHowever, it’s also important to recognise Liverpool’s commitment to maintaining a strict wage structure, which has been essential to the club’s success under FSG’s ownership. While £200,000 a week is a significant wage increase, it’s a reflection of the player’s quality and importance to the team. If the club is to continue competing at the highest level, they may need to consider a more flexible approach to wages, especially for players of Konate’s calibre.\n\nWith Real Madrid and PSG lurking in the background, Liverpool must make sure that their fiscal discipline doesn’t come at the expense of their squad’s depth. Konate’s potential exit could signal a shift in the club’s transfer strategy, but securing his future should be a priority. Fans will be hoping for a resolution that ensures Konate remains at Anfield, where he has the chance to become one of the Premier League’s top defenders."}

That’s probably a good thing. As a rule, if you can fit your understanding of something complex into a tweet, you’re usually wrong. So I’m continuing to divide and conquer here, eat the elephant one bite at a time, etc.\n\nRight now I want to address one specific question: whether people have the right to train AI in the first place. The argument that they do not goes like this:\n\nWhen a corporation trains generative AI they have unfairly used other people’s work without consent or compensation to create a new product they own. Worse, the new product directly competes with the original workers. Since the corporations didn’t own the original material and weren’t granted any specific rights to use it for training, they did not have the right to train with it. When the work was published, there was no expectation it would be used like this, as the technology didn’t exist and people did not even consider “training” as a possibility. Ultimately, the material is copyrighted, and this action violates the authors’ copyright.\n\nI have spent a lot of time thinking about this argument and its implications. Unfortunately, even though I think that while this identifies a legitimate complaint, the argument is dangerously wrong, and the consequences of acting on it (especially enforcing a new IP right) would be disastrous. Let me work through why:\n\nSo there’s a fine line to walk here, because I don’t want to dismiss the fear. The problem is real and the emotions are valid, but that doesn’t mean none of the reactions are reactionary and dangerous. And the idea that corporations training on material is copyright infringement is just that.\n\nI agree that the dynamic of corporations making for-profit tools using previously published material to directly compete with the original authors, especially when that work was published freely, is “bad.” This is also a real thing companies want to do. Replacing labor that has to be paid wages with capital that can be owned outright increases profits, which is every company’s purpose. And there’s certainly a push right now to do this. For owners and executives production without workers has always been the dream. But even though it’s economically incentivized for corporations, the wholesale replacement of human work in creative industries would be disastrous for art, artists, and society as a whole.\n\nArtists wanting to use copyright to limit the “right to train” isn’t the right approach, but not because their complaint isn’t valid. Sometimes a course of action is bad because the goal is bad, but in this case I think people making this complaint are trying to address a real problem.\n\nThe weird way Hitler particles keep appearing in artist discourse is fascinating, but probably a topic for another day. For now, suffice it to say this mentality exists and I do not respect it .\n\nUnfortunately there does exist an unhinged territorial artist mindset among people who feel an unlimited right to “control their work”, including literally preventing other people from learning from it . But the idea that people shouldn’t be able to learn from published work is genuinely evil, and to people seriously trying to argue for it are deranged.\n\nPeople have the rights to own and use their own skills and abilities by default, unless there’s a very specific reason barring them from a particular practice. You have every right to learn multiple styles and even imitate other artists, for instance. But you don’t have the right to use that skill to counterfeit, forge, copy, or otherwise plagiarize someone else, because that action is specifically harmful and prohibited. This is all very straightforward.\n\nIf humans were somehow required to have an explicit license to learn from work, it would be the end of individual creativity as we know it. In our real world, requiring licensing for every source of inspiration and skill would collapse artistic work down to a miserable chain-of-custody system that only massive established corporations could effectively participate in. That, and/or some kind of dystopian Black Mirror affair, where the human mind is technologically incapable of ingesting new information unless it comes with the requisite DRM.\n\nThe right for people to learn from anything they’re allowed to see is crucial, for what should be obvious reasons. People have an inalienable right to think. Human creativity involves creating new ideas drawing from a lived experience of ideas, designs, and practice. Influences influence people, and those people create new artistic work using their own skill and knowledge of the craft, which they own themselves. We shouldn’t need a special license for works we see to influence the way we think about the world, or to use published work to inform our knowledge of creative craft.\n\nUnlike most people earnestly making the learning rights argument, proposals to expand copyright often don’t limit the proposed expansion in a human-reasonable way. This makes sense, since they’re focused on making progress in one specific direction. So just to establish a ground rule for discussion: in the reasonable argument I’m seeing reasonable people make, regardless of how we treat AI, people learning from art is a good thing. In a good-faith discussion, I’m assuming your goal is to defend against AI, not sabotage existing human artists.\n\nThe judge acknowledges in the order that it has the potential to take down every single model that uses Stability, and I feel it can eliminate a whole class of plagiarizing models. No company would want to mess with that, and people and other companies would be more thoughtful and ask if the data in the AI model is licensed.\n\n[Kelly McKernan:] For one thing, I’m hoping to see that just the movement, in this case, is going to highlight the very problematic parts of these models and instead help move it into a phase of generative AI that has models with licensed content and with artists getting paid as it should have been the entire time.\n\nEmilia David, “What’s next for artists suing Stability AI and Midjourney” What do you want to see for yourself and how companies view, work and help distribute artists’ work after this lawsuit?\n\nIn an interview, complainant Kelly McKernan explains that the lawsuit is explicitly a demand to require companies to negotiate a license to train AI on work, not a general stand against generative AI existing.\n\nIn their lawsuit against Stability AI , artists Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, Karla Ortiz, Hawke Southworth, Grzegorz Rutkowski, Gregory Manchess, Gerald Brom, Jingna Zhang, Julia Kaye, and Adam Ellis assert that training itself is an illegal copy, and models themselves are “compressed” copies of original works.\n\nThere is also a black-sheep variation of this idea that insists training is itself copying the work. In this case there would be no need for separate rights and protections around training, since it’s a trivial application of existing copyright protection.\n\nAndrew Albanese, “Authors Join the Brewing Legal Battle Over AI” In a June 29 statement, the Authors Guild applauded the filing of the litigation—but also appeared to acknowledge the difficult legal road the cases may face in court. “Using books and other copyrighted works to build highly profitable generative AI technologies without the consent or compensation of the authors of those works is blatantly unfair—whether or not a court ultimately finds it to be fair use,” the statement read. Guild officials go on to note that they have been “lobbying aggressively” for legislation that would “clarify that permission is required to use books, articles, and other copyright-protected work in generative AI systems,” and for establishing “a collective licensing solution” to make getting permissions feasible. A subsequent June 30 open letter, signed by a who’s who of authors, urges tech industry leaders to “mitigate the damage to our profession” by agreeing to “obtain permission” and “compensate writers fairly” for using books in their AI.\n\nThe Authors Guild, “AG Statement on Writers’ Lawsuits Against OpenAI” The Authors Guild has been lobbying aggressively for guardrails around generative AI because of the urgency of the problem; specifically, we are seeking legislation that will clarify that permission is required to use books, articles, and other copyright-protected work in generative AI systems, and a collective licensing solution to make this feasible.\n\nAsserting that the right already exists is the norm. An approach — and in my opinion, a more honest one — is to argue that while it doesn’t already exist, it needs to be created. Actual lawsuits are loath to admit in their complaint that the law they want enforced doesn’t exist yet, so this logic mostly comes indirectly from advocacy organizations, like the ( particularly gross ) Authors Guild:\n\nMatilda Battersby, “Penguin Random House underscores copyright protection in AI rebuff” (Oct 2024) Publishing lawyer Chien‑Wei Lui, senior associate at Fox Williams LLP, told The Bookseller that “the chances of an AI platform providing an output that is, in itself, a copy or infringement of an author’s work, is incredibly low.” She said it was the training of LLMs “which is the infringing action, and publishers should be ensuring they can control that action for the benefit of themselves and their authors”.\n\nBattersby does a good job here in highlighting that it is explicitly the training action being objected to, irrespective of potential future outputs:\n\nAnna Ganley, Society of Authors CEO …we’re pleased to see publishers starting to add to the ‘All rights reserved’ notice to explicitly exclude the use of a work for the purpose of training [generative AI], as it provides greater clarity and helps to explain to readers what cannot be done without rights-holder consent.\n\nIn the same story, the Society of Authors explicitly affirms the idea that AI training cannot be done without a license, especially if that right is explicitly claimed:\n\nPenguin Random House Copyright Statement (Oct 2024) No part of this book may be used or reproduced in any manner for the purpose of training artificial intelligence technologies or systems. In accordance with Article 4(3) of the Digital Single Market Directive 2019/790, Penguin Random House expressly reserves this work from the text and data mining exception.\n\nA prime example of this is the book publishing company Penguin Random House, which asserts that the right to train an AI from a work is already a right that they can reserve:\n\nTypically, when the learning rights theory is seen in the wild it’s being pushed by copyright rightsholders who are asserting that the right to restrict others from training on their works already exists.\n\nThis is already being widely discussed in various forms, usually as a theory of legal interpretation or a proposal for new policy.\n\nThis learning right would be parallel to other reservable rights, like reproduction: it could be denied outright, or licensed separately from both viewing and reproduction rights at the discretion of the rightsholder. Material could be published such that people were freely able to view it but not able to use it as part of a process that would eventually create new work, including training AI. The mechanical ability to train data is not severable from the ability to view it, but the legal right would be.\n\nThe idea of a learning right is this: in addition to the traditional reproduction right copyright reserves to the author, authors should be able to prevent people from training AI on their work by withholding the right.\n\nThis was one of my first thoughts too. Looking at the inputs and outputs, as well as the overall dynamic of unfair exploitation of creative work, “copyright violation” is a good place to start. I even have a draft article where I was going to argue for this same point myself. But as I’ve thought through the problem further, that logic breaks down. And the more I work through it, every IP-based argument I’ve seen to try to support artists has massively harmful implications that make the cure worse than the disease.\n\nCopyright isn’t a stupid first thought. Copyright (or creative rights in general) intuitively seems like the relevant mechanism for protecting work from unauthorized uses and plagiarism, since the AI models are trained using copyrighted work that is licensed for public viewing but not for commercial use. Fundamentally, the thing copyright is “for” is making sure artists are paid for their work .\n\nSo let me focus in on the idea that one needs to license a “right to train”, especially for training that uses copyrighted work. Although I’m ultimately going to argue against it, I think this is a reasonable first thought. It’s also a very serious proposal that’s actively being argued for in significant forums.\n\nIn this way, AI training is once again parallel to human learning. Generative AI and human work have the same criteria for success. As an artist learning on material, you don’t want the input images to be closely mimicked in the outputs. You don’t want your style or pose choices to be dependent on specifics from your example material. You want to learn how to make art, and then you should be able to make anything.\n\nThis isn’t a cover-your-ass measure to make sure a service isn’t accidentally reproducing copyrighted materials (like Google Books, which stores full copies of books but is careful not to expose the underlying data to the public). The entire value of generative AI is that its outputs are new and not redundant. Accidentally outputting images that are even remotely similar to the inputs is poor performance for the product itself.\n\nSince the entire purpose of generative models is to be able to generate entirely new output, it’s very important to make sure individual input images are dependent mostly on the prompt given to the generator and not any particular images in the training data. Generative AI needs to have the broadest possible possibility space, and so significant amounts of research go towards that goal:\n\nThe case where a very generic prompt is able to produce a relatively specific work seems suspicious, but — again — makes sense when compared to a human. If you asked a human artist for something extremely tightly tied to one kind of work like “Italian video game plumber” they’d probably make the same associations you do, and draw something related to Mario unless you told them not to.\n\nI think, once again, this is very parallel to the human process. If you asked someone to draw a specific piece they’ve seen, they could probably approximate it around 2% of the time.\n\nBy running “attacks” on Stable Diffusion, models can be tricked into reproducing some of its input images to a reasonable degree of recognizability. Carlini, N., Hayes, J., Nasr, M., Jagielski, M., Sehwag, V., Tramèr, F., Balle, B., Ippolito, D., & Wallace, E. (2023). Extracting Training Data from Diffusion Models was one study in memorization. Researchers trained their own Stable Diffusion model on the CIFAR-10 dataset of publicly-available images. Given full access to the original data and their trained model, they attempted to generate image thumbnails that were significantly similar to images found in the input data. They were able to show “memorization” of only 1,280 images, or 2.5% of the training data.\n\nSo far in this article I’ve been discussing generative AI at a very high level. The actual frequency of overfitting and “input memorization” varies significantly depending on the dataset, training methodology, and other technical factors specific to individual products.\n\n“Memorization” is a similar bug that’s describes exactly what it sounds like: when an AI model is able to reproduce something very close to one of its inputs. Overwhelmingly, memorization is caused by bad training data that includes multiple copies of the same work. Since famous works of art are often duplicated in data sets of publicly available images, the model “knows” them very well and is able to reproduce them with a high level of fidelity if prompted:\n\nIn the field of generative AI research, if even 1%-2% of the outputs of a generative model are similar to any of the model’s inputs, that’s called overfitting, and it’s a bug. Overfitting is waste, and prevents these tools from being able to do their job.\n\nI have to take time away from my main argument here to make an important caveat, which is that it’s not true to categorically say generative AI is truly incapable of reproducing any of the work it was trained on. This is true from a data science perspective (since the domain of the training data overlaps with the domain of possible outputs), but it’s also practically possible to use a model to generate images that resemble its inputs, under specific conditions.\n\nIt’s also not true that generated outputs are “mosaics”, collages”, or snippets of existing artwork interpolated together. The tool fundamentally doesn’t work like that; it neither reproduces and composes image segments nor interpolates image chunks. Asserting that generative AI is a “collage” tool isn’t even reductive, it’s entirely wrong at all levels.\n\nThe authors also argued that Llama itself is an infringing work. Chhabria said the theory “would have to mean that if you put the Llama language model next to Sarah Silverman’s book, you would say they’re similar.” … The judge said he would dismiss most of the claims with leave to amend, and that he would dismiss them again if the authors failed to argue that Llama’s output was substantially similar to their works.\n\n“When I make a query of Llama, I’m not asking for a copy of Sarah Silverman’s book – I’m not even asking for an excerpt,” Chhabria said.\n\n[U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria] criticized the second claim on Thursday, casting doubt on the idea that the text generated by Llama copies or resembles their works.\n\nBlake Brittain, “US judge trims AI copyright lawsuit against Meta” The authors sued Meta and Microsoft-backed OpenAI in July. They argued that the companies infringed their copyrights by using their books to train AI language models, and separately said that the models’ output also violates their copyrights.\n\nThe same dynamic played out in another case, this time with complainants unable to demonstrate similarity even with much simpler text examples:\n\nAs Runway’s filing puts it: “First, the mere fact that Plaintiffs must rely on these papers to allege that models can “store” training images demonstrates that their theory is meritless, because it shows that Plaintiffs have been unable to elicit any “stored” copies of their own registered works from Stable Diffusion, despite ample opportunities to try. And that is fatal to their claim.”The complaint goes on:“…nowhere do [the artists] allege that they, or anyone else, have been able to elicit replicas of their registered works from Stable Diffusion by entering text prompts. Plaintiffs’ silence on this issue speaks volumes, and by itself defeats their Model Theory.”\n\nCarl Franzen, “Stability, Midjourney, Runway hit back in AI art lawsuit” However, the AI video generation company Runway — which collaborated with Stability AI to fund the training of the open-source image generator model Stable Diffusion — has an interesting perspective on this. It notes that simply by including these research papers in their amended complaint, the artists are basically giving up the game — they aren’t showing any examples of Runway making exact copies of their work. Rather, they are relying on third-party ML researchers to state that’s what AI diffusion models are trying to do.\n\nSARAH ANDERSEN, et al., v. STABILITY AI LTD., et al., ORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS AND STRIKE … I am not convinced that copyright claims based [on] a derivative theory can survive absent ‘substantial similarity’ type allegations. The cases plaintiffs rely on appear to recognize that the alleged infringer’s derivative work must still bear some similarity to the original work or contain the protected elements of the original work.\n\nWhen people have tried to demonstrate a reproductive effect in generative AI — even incredibly highly motivated people arguing a case in a court of law — they have been unable to do so. This played out dramatically in the Stability AI lawsuit, where complainants were unable to show cases of output even substantially similar to their copyrighted inputs, and so didn’t even make an allegation that was the case. Instead, they made the argument that there was somehow a derivative work involved even though there was nothing even resembling reproduction, and the judge rightly struck it down:\n\nBut are any of those accusations actually true? Pretty solidly “no”. The claim made in the suit is fundamentally wrong on all accounts. Not only does generative AI work like this in general, this isn’t even how Stable Diffusion works in particular. From a technical, logical, and philosophical perspective, we know the models don’t have copies of the original data, only information about the relationships between forms. They try to generate new work to match a prompt, and the new work is the product of the prompt, the model, and a random seed. There’s nothing close to a “make a copy of this specific input image please” button, and if you try to make it do that anyway, it doesn’t work.\n\nIf this were the case, it would be a solid argument against generative AI. Even if the model itself doesn’t contain literal copies of input work, it would still be a copyright violation for it to reproduce its inputs (or approximations of them) on-demand. And if the primary purpose of the tool were to make unlicensed copies of copyrighted inputs, that could make training a problem. Even if we can’t show copies being made during training, or analyze the model to find stored copies, if the main thing the tool does is make unlicensed reproductions of existing input works, that’s an issue.\n\nAndersen v. Stability AI Ltd. Complaint Diffusion is a way for a machine-learning model to calculate how to reconstruct a copy of its Training Images. For each Training Image, a diffusion model finds the sequence of denoising steps to reconstruct that specific image. Then it stores this sequence of steps. … A diffusion model is then able to reconstruct copies of each Training Image. Furthermore, being able to reconstruct copies of the Training Images is not an incidental side effect. The primary goal of a diffusion model is to reconstruct copies of the training data with maximum accuracy and fidelity to the Training Image. It is meant to be a duplicate. … Because a trained diffusion model can produce a copy of any of its Training Images—which could number in the billions—the diffusion model can be considered an alternative way of storing a copy of those images.\n\nThe Stable Diffusion lawsuit also makes the accusation that image diffusion is fundamentally a system to reconstruct the input images, and that the model is still effectively a reproduction tool:\n\nBut this downloaded “copy” is irrelevant to the question of copyright. By definition, the images at these public web addresses are already published and actively being shared for the public. There is already full permission for anyone to view them, and on the internet that includes downloading these temporary copies. The general public already has permission to view and study these images. So the acquisition of publicly published data is irrelevant, and the question still hinges on whether the act of training is a copyright violation.\n\nIt’s true that training requires copying copyrighted work as a prerequisite. Data sets used for image training pair images with text descriptions, but the data sets usually include a URL to where the image is publicly hosted instead of attaching the image files themselves. This means that before you can train a model on the data set, you have to download ephemeral copies of all the images in the data set.\n\nThe act of training on copyrighted work, even work distributed freely, requires the trainer to make copies of copyrighted work to use as input data. Even without getting into the details of training itself, AI companies have to download and “scrape” massive amounts of copyrighted work as a prerequisite. These are all unauthorized copies already, and constitute copyright violations.\n\nThere is a red-herring argument people make at this point about “unauthorized copying” that goes like this:\n\nThis is a technical reality, but it also makes intuitive sense that it doesn’t need to store images to work. The model isn’t trying to copy any given work, it’s only storing an understanding of the patterns and relationships between pixels. When an artist is sketching on paper and considering their line quality, that process doesn’t involve thinking through millions of specific memories of individual works. The new work comes from an understanding: information generated from study of the works, but not a memorized copy of any set of specific images.\n\nKit Walsh, How We Think About Copyright and AI Art The Stable Diffusion model makes four gigabytes of observations regarding more than five billion images. That means that its model contains less than one byte of information per image analyzed (a byte is just eight bits—a zero or a one). The complaint against Stable Diffusion characterizes this as “compressing” (and thus storing) the training images, but that’s just wrong. With few exceptions, there is no way to recreate the images used in the model based on the facts about them that are stored. Even the tiniest image file contains many thousands of bytes; most will include millions. Mathematically speaking, Stable Diffusion cannot be storing copies …\n\nBut even without requiring any knowledge of the process or the ability to inspect the models (both of which we do have), it’s literally impossible for the final model to contain compressed copies of the training images, because the model file simply isn’t big enough. From a data science perspective, we know full artistic works simply cannot be compressed down to one byte and reinflated, no matter how large your data set is. This should align with your intuition, too; you can’t fit huge amounts of data in a tiny space!\n\nThis description is entirely wrong. While it might be understandable as a naive guess at what’s going on, it’s provably false that this is what’s happening. It’s objectively untrue that the input data is stored in the model. Not only is that data not found in the models themselves, but the general technology is based on published research, and the process of training simply does not involve doing that. It’s baffling that anyone was willing to go on the record as saying this, let alone make it the basis of a major lawsuit.\n\nWhen used to produce images from prompts by its users, Stable Diffusion uses the Training Images to produce seemingly new images through a mathematical software process. These “new” images are based entirely on the Training Images and are derivative works of the particular images Stable Diffusion draws from when assembling a given output. Ultimately, it is merely a complex collage tool. … All AI Image Products operate in substantially the same way and store and incorporate countless copyrighted images as Training Images. … Stability did not attempt to negotiate licenses for any of the Training Images. Stability simply took them. Stability has embedded and stored compressed copies of the Training Images within Stable Diffusion.\n\nAndersen v. Stability AI Ltd. Complaint By training Stable Diffusion on the Training Images, Stability caused those images to be stored at and incorporated into Stable Diffusion as compressed copies. Stability made them without the consent of the artists and without compensating any of those artists.\n\nThis is such a common misconception that this myth was the argument made by the Stability lawsuit I described in “Naive copying”, that the act of training is literally storage of compressed copies of the inputs:\n\nFirst, copies of the training data are not stored in the model at all, not even as thumbnails. Text models don’t have excerpts of works and image models don’t have low-resolution thumbnails or any pixel data at all.\n\nEven if it’s for the purpose of analysis, it’s still critical that training not involve copying and storing the input data, which would be unlicensed reproduction. But training itself isn’t copying or reproduction, on either a technical or practical level. Not only does training not store the original data in the model, the model it generates isn’t designed to reproduce the inputs.\n\nThat’s why I think that the process of training really is, both mechanically and philosophically, more like human learning than anything else. It’s not quite “learning”, since the computer is a tool and not an actor in its own right, but it’s absolutely parallel to the process of training a subconscious. “Training” to create a “model” is the right description of what’s happening.\n\nAI instead tries to emulate these functionalities of the unconscious mind. For machine learning tasks like image recognition, instead of describing a logical procedure for recognizing various objects, the process of training creates a model that can later be used to “intuit” answers that reflect the relationships that were captured in the model. Instead of defining a specific procedure, the relationships identified in training reflect a model of what “correctness” is, and so allows a program to work according to a model never explicitly defined by human statements. When the program runs, the output behavior is primarily driven by the data in the model, which is an “understanding” of the relationships found in correct practice.\n\nBut there are also mental tasks people do unconsciously like shape recognition, writing recognition, facial recognition, et cetera. For these, we’re not doing active analysis according to a procedure. There’s some unconscious subsystem that gives our executive consciousness information, but not according to a procedure we consciously understand or can articulate as a procedure a machine could follow.\n\nIn terms of real-life tasks, there’s a type of mental task that’s done “consciously” by executive function, and a type of task that’s done “unconsciously.” Traditional programming is based on creating a machine that executes a program composed of consciously-written instructions, mirroring executive function. Mathematics, organization, logic, etc are things we learn to do consciously with intent, and can describe as a procedure.\n\nI’m using the word “understanding” here to capture the functionality of the tool, but I don’t mean to imply that it’s conscious or sentient. Machine learning is not a magical thinking machine, but it’s also not a database of examples it copies. It’s a specific approach to solving a particular kind of problem. In the same way scripted languages emulate conscious executive function, machine learning emulates unconscious processes.\n\nWhat’s fascinating about generative AI, from a technological perspective, is how this modeled understanding of relationships in the data is unlike traditional programming and instead functions like subconscious pattern recognition. The model does not understand the meaning of the patterns, and so doesn’t start with a human-authored description of the subject, nor does it construct an articulated program that can be run to produce a specific kind of output. The model is instead an attempt to capture an unarticulated understanding of what correct forms and patterns “seem like”.\n\nThis means many elements of copyrighted works are not themselves copyrighted or copyrightable. For example, “cats have four legs and a tail” is a fact that might be encapsulated in art, and an AI might be able to “understand” that well enough to know to compose a depiction of a cat. But creating another picture of a cat isn’t violating any copyright, because even if a copyrighted work was used to convey the information, you can’t reserve an exclusive right over the knowledge of what cats are. The data training captures is an understanding of these un-copyrightable elements.\n\nTraining saves the results of this analysis as a model. Copyright, though, is concerned with the reproduction of works. The compositional elements that training captures, like technique and style, are explicitly un-copyrightable. You can’t copyright non-creative choices: you can’t copyright a style, you can’t copyright a practice, you can’t copyright a technique, you can’t copyright a motif, and you can’t copyright a fact.\n\nWhile elements of the output like “form”, “technique”, and “style” bear resemblance to their source data, the form and function of the final generated product is up to the user and doesn’t need to resemble any of the training inputs.\n\nDALL·E is a 12-billion parameter version of GPT‑3⁠ trained to generate images from text descriptions, using a dataset of text–image pairs. We’ve found that it has a diverse set of capabilities, including creating anthropomorphized versions of animals and objects, combining unrelated concepts in plausible ways, rendering text, and applying transformations to existing images. … Combining unrelated concepts The compositional nature of language allows us to put together concepts to describe both real and imaginary things. We find that DALL·E also has the ability to combine disparate ideas to synthesize objects, some of which are unlikely to exist in the real world. We explore this ability in two instances: transferring qualities from various concepts to animals, and designing products by taking inspiration from unrelated concepts.\n\nWith generative AI, the purpose of models is to use this “understanding” as a tool to create entirely new outputs . The goal is generalization : the ability to “generalize” concepts from inputs and store this information not as a copy, but as vectors that can be combined to form outputs composed not of the words or pixels of training data, but their ideas. Generalization has been one of the main selling points — if not the selling point — of generative AI, ever since the earliest products:\n\nAndersen v. Stability AI Ltd. Complaint The program relies on complicated mathematics, linear algebra, and a series of algorithms and requires powerful computers and computer processing to recognize underlying relationships in the data.\n\nThis is something even the original complaint in the Andersen v. Stability AI case gets right:\n\nTraining is the process of mathematically analyzing data and identifying underlying relationships, then outputting a machine-usable model of information that describes how to use those relationships to generate new outputs that follow the same patterns. The data in the model isn’t copied from the work, it’s the analysis of the work.\n\nA surprisingly popular understanding is that generative AI is a database, and constructing an output image is just collaging existing images it looks up on a table. This is completely incorrect. The ways generative AI training actually works is something legitimately parallel to how humans “learn” what things should look like. It’s genuinely incredible technology, and it’s not somehow “buying the hype” to accurately understand the process.\n\nBefore understanding what training isn’t (copying), it’s important to understand what training is for, on both a technical and practical level.\n\nI think the unambiguous answer to this question is that the act of training is viewing and analysis, not copying . There is no particular copy of the work (or any copyrightable elements) stored in the model. While some models are capable of producing work similar to their inputs, this isn’t their intended function, and that ability is instead an effect of their general utility. Models use input work as the subject of analysis, but they only “keep” the understanding created, not the original work.\n\nTraining an AI involves processing large volumes of creative material. In the standard scenario where the entity training the model has the right to view that work but no particular license to copy it, is the act of training a copyright violation? The vital question this hinges on is this: is the actual act of training an AI equivalent to copying , or is it more comparable to viewing and analysis ? Are companies training on work copying that work (which they do not have the right to do) or reviewing the work (which they do)? If training is copying, then training on this data would be a copyright violation. If not, we’ll have to dig deeper to find a reason model training on unlicensed material could be illegal.\n\nThe point of copyright in the first place is to incentivize development and progress of the arts by offsetting a possible perverse incentive that would stop people from creating new work. Learning from other work and using that knowledge to develop new works is exactly the behavior copyright is designed to encourage. Moreover, when copyright does grant exclusive rights to creators, it only protects tangible creative expressions. It’s not a monopoly right over a vast possibility space of all the work they could theoretically make. So it’s exactly correct that learning is not a reserved right, and letting people view work necessarily allows them to learn from it.\n\nCopyright allowing people to freely learn from creative works makes complete sense because it also maps directly to what copyright is ultimately for.\n\nMeta’s behavior here is an extremely relevant case because it’s an explicit example of crossing the line into illegality. By my logic here, Meta had an extraordinarily large amount of data they could have trained on: any data in the public domain, any data published on the open web, and any media they purchased even one copy of. But instead they chose to train using more data than they had any right to access in the first place. Even though I’m arguing that most training should be legal, by engaging in unabashed media piracy to acquire the data in the first place Meta shows a clear example of what violating the limits and engaging in illegal training looks like.\n\nThis is a completely different situation than using works you own or scraping publicly available data from the internet. This is just doing crimes for profit. The model created from pirated data is criminal proceeds, and Meta should absolutely not be permitted to use the ill-gotten assets as part of any further business.\n\n“Meta has treated the so-called ‘public availability’ of shadow datasets as a get-out-of-jail-free card, notwithstanding that internal Meta records show every relevant decision-maker at Meta, up to and including its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, knew LibGen was ‘a dataset we know to be pirated,’” the plaintiffs allege in this motion.\n\nKate Knibbs, “Meta Secretly Trained Its AI on a Notorious Piracy Database, Newly Unredacted Court Docs Reveal” These newly unredacted documents reveal exchanges between Meta employees unearthed in the discovery process, like a Meta engineer telling a colleague that they hesitated to access LibGen data because “torrenting from a [Meta-owned] corporate laptop doesn’t feel right 😃”. They also allege that internal discussions about using LibGen data were escalated to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg (referred to as “MZ” in the memo handed over during discovery) and that Meta’s AI team was “approved to use” the pirated material.\n\nMeta did exactly that, because they don’t care about any of this high-minded “what’s actually legal” business. They’re just crooks.\n\nSo, if a company just pirates all the copyrighted material they can and use it to train a model, that’s still obviously illegal. In addition to the unfair competition issue, that particular model is the direct result of specifically criminal activity, and it’d be totally inappropriate if the company could still make money off it.\n\nThe flip side of this is that you do actually have to be able to lawfully view the material for any of this logic to apply. There is not an unlimited, automatic right to be able to view and learn from all information. You can’t demand free access to copyrighted work just because you want to learn from it. You can buy a copy, use a library, or find it published on the internet, but you still need to have a lawful way to access it in the first place.\n\nBut, — and this is me being extremely generous — I think what he was trying to get at here was the same point I’m trying to make: that people do have every right to learn from already-published material. He was just so staggeringly incompetent at selling it that instead of saying any of that he made a different, wrong claim.\n\nI think that with respect to content that’s already on the open web, the social contract of that content since the ‘90s has been that it is fair use. Anyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce with it. That has been “freeware,” if you like, that’s been the understanding.\n\nIn an all-time hall-of-fame screw up, the CEO of Microsoft AI Mustafa Suleyman responded to the question of whether “the AI companies have effectively stolen the world’s IP” with this historically disastrous answer :\n\nYou have the right to use materials that you already have the right to view to learn the craft. If you buy a painting, or someone posts an image online, your right to view it (which you’ve been granted) is inextricable from your right to think about that image. It’s definitely not “theft” to learn from work!\n\nAll that means the right to learn is mechanically coupled to the right to view. Rightsholders can use the reproduction right to control who is able to view a work, but if someone can view it, they can learn from it. There’s no way to separate the two. You can’t withhold the right for people to learn and still publish material for them to view.\n\nDon't want to trigger anyone, but I have to confess that I trained my writing algorithms by reading other people's books, including countless books I didn't pay for.\n\nYou don’t have to negotiate a commercial license for work just because knowing about it influenced something you did. That’s not reserved, and so isn’t a licensable right. You don’t have to negotiate a license from the creator, because the creator isn’t able to reserve an “education” right they can grant you. It would be absurd if they could!\n\nLearning is another unenumerated right, and is nearly the same thing as viewing already. If you’re able to learn from something, you’re allowed to do so. And this unenumerated right can’t be decoupled from the viewing. Learning isn’t a reserved right, so you don’t need specific permission to do it. You have the right by default, and the only way for people to deny you that right is to keep you from experiencing the work at all.\n\nBut only a few rights are enumerated and reserved by copyright. Viewing, like most actions, is an unenumerated right; you don’t need any particular active permission to do it, you just need to not be actively infringing on a reserved right. If you’re able to view something and there’s nothing specifically denying you the right, you have the right to view it. And the right to restrict someone from viewing something they’re already able to view isn’t one of the special rights copyright reserves.\n\nIf you hold the copyright to a work you are automatically granted a reserved reproduction right, and you can manage that right in an extremely granular way. You can reserve the right to make copies to yourself, or you can license specific parties to be able to copy and distribute the work by contract, or you can make a work generally redistributable under specific conditions, or you can relinquish these rights and release things as open-source or public domain . Because the law allows you to explicitly reserve that particular right, and that right can be sublicensed, you retain extremely specific control over the specific behavior that right covers.\n\nReserved rights are enumerated : only rights explicitly listed are reserved. Non-reserved rights are unenumerated : they’re not on any comprehensive list, but you have a right to do anything unless there’s a specific prohibition against it. It’s allow-by-default with a blacklist of exception, not deny-by-default with a whitelist. You can’t stab someone in the eye with a fork, not because “stabbing” is missing from your list of allowed actions, but because “stabbing” is assault, which is explicitly on a short list of things you are expressly prohibited from doing.\n\nCopyright grants creators specific reserved rights. Without copyright, people would be able to act lawfully : do whatever they want to do as long as there wasn’t a specific law or contractual agreement against it, including copying creative works and using them commercially without permission. Copyright singles out a few rights — namely the reproduction right — and reserves them to the creator, who can then manage those rights at their discretion. People are still able to do whatever they want with creative works as long as there isn’t a specific law prohibiting it or a reserved permission they don’t have. They can’t reproduce work by default, but only because that right is explicitly reserved.\n\nBut talking about who does and doesn’t “have” a “viewing right” is a backwards way to think about it.\n\nFortunately I think this all maps pretty cleanly to people’s actual expectations in the medium. If someone posts art, they know other people can see it, but they also know the public isn’t allowed to freely redistribute it or commercialize it. It’s just public to view.\n\nJust publishing something publicly doesn’t mean you forfeit the copyright to it. But you inevitably lose certain “soft power” over it, such as secrecy and the ability to prevent discussion of the work. But that doesn’t mean the work is in the public domain, and it doesn’t mean people have an unlimited right to reproduce or commercialize work just because it’s on the internet. Publishing a work does not mean you’re relinquishing any reserved right, except possibly licensing a web platform to serve the file to people. Putting work “out there” does not grant the public the reserved rights of copying, redistributing, or using your work commercially. Just because a stock image is on Google Images doesn’t mean you have the right to use it in a commercial product.\n\nWhen you post your creative work publicly (on the internet or elsewhere), you own the copyright (since it’s creative work fixed in a medium), but posting it publicly also means you are publishing the work. This scenario of someone having the right to view something but not owning a copy or any particular license is extremely common on the internet. If you put a work online, anyone you serve a copy to (or authorize a platform to serve a copy to) has the right to view it.\n\nIf you own a physical copy of something you’re obviously able — both physically and legally — to observe it. Examples of this are books, prints, posters, and any other physical media. You have it, it inspires you, you reference it, you’re golden. There are also cases when you don’t own a copy, but have the right to observe a performance. Examples of this are ticketed performances and theater showings, but also things like publicly and privately displayed work. If you visit a museum you can view the works; if you visit a library you can read the books.\n\nPeople are only able to learn from work we can observe in the first place, so let’s think about the set of instructional and inspiring work a given person/company has the right to view.\n\nRegardless of what new IP rights can and should be created, a reservable learning does not exist within copyright now.\n\nThere is a strange circular reasoning here. Even if you want to define art as something uniquely done by humans, tool-assisted art is still clearly human agency producing artistic output which is usually indistinguishable from work produced without the aid of the tool. There is no categorical distinction to make about the artistic products, either.\n\nI’ve seen people argue that AI outputs must necessarily be uncreative, and work can’t be considered to be “true” human authorship. “The final output reflects the user’s acceptance of [a system], rather than [authorship].” This logic is unconvincing. How does this differ from photoshop use reflecting “acceptance of a program’s facilities”, or a photograph reflecting “acceptance” of an existing view?\n\nTrying to find separate criteria that happens to map onto the result that makes sense to you, at the moment, is a dangerous mistake. (A “policy hack”, which is another topic I plan to write on later....) No, if you’re going to try to regulate a specific dynamic (in this case, learning) you need to actually regulate the dynamic in question in a clear, internally-consistent way.\n\nIf you’re trying to divide technology into categories of “good tools” and “bad tools”, you need a clear categorical distinction. But what is the criteria that makes generative AI uniquely bad? There doesn’t appear to be one. It’s obviously not just that generative AI is software. It also can’t be that generative AI is “theft-based”, because it obviously isn’t. It’s performing the same dynamic of learning that we want to see, but using software to do it. And we know “using software to do it” doesn’t turn a good thing bad. And it’s obviously absurd to say we should stop building new tools at some arbitrary point, and only techniques that were already invented and established are valid to use.\n\nAI is fundamentally the same kind of tool we expect people to use regularly, but a degree more “advanced” than our expectations. The people arguing that AI is anti-art aren’t arguing that the correct state of affairs is a technological jihad, they’re wanting to return to “good technology”, like Blender. But that’s no basis for a categorical distinction.\n\nThis “real person” distraction is a common stumbling point in discussions about things like accessibility. The goal is not to determine some “standard human” with a fixed set of capabilities and enforce that standard on people. The goal isn’t just to “elevate” the “disabled” to some minimum viable standard, and it’s certainly not to reduce the function of over-performers until everyone fits the same mold. Access and function are goods in and of themselves, and it’s worthwhile to extend both.\n\nThis is a pet issue of mine. I am convinced that trying to draw a clean line between “people” and “technology” is a disastrously bad idea, especially if that distinction is meant to be a load-bearing part of policy. People aren’t separable from technology. The fact that we use tools is a fundamental part of our intelligence and sapience. Every person is a will enacting itself on the world through various technical measures. If you don’t let a builder use a hammer or a painter use a brush, you’re crippling them just as if you’d disabled their arms. And — looking in the other direction — the body is a machine we use the same way as we use any tool. We use technology and tools as prosthesis that fundamentally extend human function, which is a good thing.\n\nRemember, AI is a tool, not an actor. There’s no sentient AI wanting to learn how to make art, only people building art-producing tools. So if you want to make a distinction here, it’s not between a person-actor and a machine-actor, it’s between a person with a tool and a person without a tool.\n\nI think this is another direction that makes some sense as a first thought, but quickly breaks down when taken to its logical conclusions. There simply isn’t a meaningful way to distinguish between a “tool-assisted” process and a “natural” process. Any requirement trying to limit AI training on the basis of its actual function of learning from work would necessarily limit human learning as well. And not in a way that can be solved by just writing down “no it doesn’t” as part of the policy!\n\nSo, if the problem is how automated or synthetic the tool is, is that somewhere we can draw a policy line? Is the right approach to say only humans can learn freely, and an automated system needs an explicit license to do the equivalent training?\n\nPeople objecting to training generative AI are objecting to a kind of learning, but they don’t have that same objection when people do the same thing. As I’ve said, I don’t think any reasonable person actually objects to humans learning from existing work they have access to. No, the objection to model training is tied to the “automatedness” of the training and the “ownability” of the models. Humans doing functionally the same thing (but slower) isn’t an issue.\n\nGoing after tools instead of individual works is an attempt to short-circuit the system. People creating work and being challenged if there’s a valid challenge to make is the only way this can reasonably be managed. If tools are banned and copyright expansionists are successful in preventing vast spaces of completely legitimate, non-infringing works from being created in the first place, that’s a disaster. In effect those works are all being banned without anything approaching due process. Artists have a right to defend themselves against accusations of copyright infringement, but if whole categories of work are guilty until proven innocent, the work can’t be created in the first place, and the opportunity for due process people are owed is implicitly smothered.\n\nIt makes complete sense that this is what they’d prefer, but total prevention satisfies that party at the expense of everyone else (and creativity as a whole), so it’s the job of a functional system to not accommodate it. The whole point of copyright needs to be encouraging the creation of new works, not giving rightsholders whatever conveniences they can think to ask for. Overaggressive enforcement that prevents whole categories of work from being produced in the first place needs to be completely off the table.\n\nThis is obviously not what corporations with “IP assets” would prefer. It would be much safer for them if no potentially infringing work could be created in the first place. If it’s impossible to make new art at all, not only do the rightsholders not have to make a specific claim and argue a specific case, they don’t risk any “damage” being done by circulation of an infringing work before they can catch it.\n\nBecause no one has been able to show that models are actually infringing works, anti-AI lawsuits are reduced to trying to make the act of training illegal. This is a dangerously wrong approach. The actual question copyright is concerned with is whether a specific work infringes on a reserved right. This is a question you can only effectively ask after a potentially infringing work is produced, and in order to evaluate the claim you have to examine the work in question.\n\nMedia companies frequently make the argument that an entire category of tools (from VHS to hard drives ) needs to be penalized or banned entirely just because it’s possible to use the tool in a way that infringes copyright. Arguing to prevent the training of generative AI in the first place is exactly the same cheat: trying to criminalize a tool instead of adjudicating specific violations as appropriate.\n\nThe idea that we should structure technology such that people are mechanically unable to do a particular objectionable thing is a familiar perversion of enforcement . This is a topic I want to write on later in more depth, but as it relates to learning rights, this is a pretty clear attempt to aggressively prevent whole categories of behavior by preemptively disabling people from a whole category of behavior.\n\nLearning isn’t theft. If it’s a machine for doing something that is not theft, it’s not a theft machine. It’s just a machine that humans can use to do the same things they were already doing.\n\nThe same logic applies to everything. Using copy-paste while editing a document doesn’t mean the final product doesn’t represent your original work, even though plagiarism is one of the things copy-paste can do. Tracing and reference images can be used for plagiarism, but the tools in use don’t determine the function of the product.\n\nPlagiarism, forgery, and other forms of harmful mimicry are not novel dynamics. Generative AI does not introduce these problems into a culture that hasn’t already been dealing with them. These are categories of violations that aren’t coupled to specific tools, but are things people do using whatever means are available.\n\nJiang, H. H., Brown, L., Cheng, J., Khan, M., Gupta, A., Workman, D., Hanna, A., Flowers, J., & Gebru, T. (2023). AI Art and its Impact on Artists. Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, 363–374. This type of invasive style mimicry can have more severe consequences if an artist’s style is mimicked for nefarious purposes such as harassment, hate speech and genocide denial. In her New York Times Op-ed, artist Sarah Andersen writes about how even before the advent of image generators people edited her work “to reflect violently racist messages advocating genocide and Holocaust denial, complete with swastikas and the introduction of people getting pushed into ovens. The images proliferated online, with sites like Twitter and Reddit rarely taking them down.” She adds that “Through the bombardment of my social media with these images, the alt-right created a shadow version of me, a version that advocated neo-Nazi ideology… I received outraged messages and had to contact my publisher to make my stance against this ultraclear.” She underscores how this issue is exacerbated by the advent of image generators, writing “The notion that someone could type my name into a generator and produce an image in my style immediately disturbed me… I felt violated.”\n\nPlagiarism and copyright infringement aren’t the only harms generative AI can be used to inflict on people. “Invasive style mimicry” can be a component of all sorts of horrible abuse:\n\nThe user was responsible for the direction and output of the tool. Neither the software nor its vendor participated; the user who actively used the tool towards a specific goal was the only relevant agent. The fact that the computer internally copies bytes from disk to RAM to disk doesn’t mean computers, disks, or RAM are inherently evil either. Tools just make people effective, and a person used that ability to commit orthogonal offenses.\n\nImagine the scenario where someone opens an image in Paint, changes it slightly, and passes the altered copy off as their original work. That’s copyright infringement because the output is an infringing copy and plagiarism because it’s being falsely presented as original authorship. The fact that Paint was used doesn’t mean Paint is inherently nefarious or that any other work made with Paint should be presumed to be nefarious.\n\nThe tools used don’t single-handedly determine if a particular action constitutes copyright infringement. Whether creating a new work constitutes copyright infringement (or even plagiarism more generally) is determined by the nature of the new work, not the method of its creation. If a tool is generally useful, you can’t argue that using that particular tool is evidence of foul play. It’s the play that can be foul, and that comes from the person using the tool. The evaluation of the work depends on the work itself.\n\nJiang, H. H., Brown, L., Cheng, J., Khan, M., Gupta, A., Workman, D., Hanna, A., Flowers, J., & Gebru, T. (2023). AI Art and its Impact on Artists. Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, 363–374. In conclusion, image generators are not artists: they require human aims and purposes to direct their “production” or “reproduction,” and it is these human aims and purposes that shape the directions to which their outputs are produced.\n\nGenerative AI is a tool, and has to be used by a human agent to produce anything other than noise. There’s agreement on this point across the spectrum, including the very wrong papers arguing for expansion of copyright to cover learning rights:\n\nFirst, generative AI is a general-purpose tool. It’s possible for people to intentionally use it in objectionable ways (plagiarism, replication, etc.), but the vast majority of its uses and outputs don’t constitute any sort of legitimate offense against anyone. The argument against training is that it creates a model that could be misused in the future, but it’s completely inappropriate to use copyright legislation to prevent the creation of a tool in the first place. Law has no business banning general-purpose tools just because they could potentially* be used later in infringing ways.\n\nIt’s against sound philosophical principles — including copyright’s — to try to attack tools and not specific objectionable actions. The applications of AI that are specifically offensive (i.e., plagiarism) are applications. Trying to go after the tools early is overaggressive enforcement that short-circuits due process in a way that prevents huge amounts of behavior that doesn’t represent any kind of legitimate offense against artists. There’s also not a clear way to cut a line between training and human learning.\n\nCreative work should not be considered a “derivative work” of every inspiring source and every work that their author used to develop their skills. And there’s not a sound way to make an argument for heavy creative restrictions that only “sticks” to generative AI, and not human actors.\n\nThe answer to all these questions is no. You can’t (and shouldn’t) expand copyright to limit how people can train on the material, no matter what tools are involved.\n\nBut is this the wrong outcome? Copyright isn’t a natural law that can only be understood and worked within; it’s an institution humans have created in order to meet specific policy goals. So should copyright powers be expanded to give creators and rightsholders a mechanism to prevent AI training on their works unless they license those rights? Can you somehow split the right to view the material and the right to learn from the material? Or could you isolate AI training as a case where the rates could be separate?\n\nSo, we can rule out AI training as being a copyright violation at this point. Training only requires the same ability to view and analyze work people already have. The training itself doesn’t involve “compressing” or making a copy of the work, and it doesn’t result in a tool that acts as a database that will reproduce the original inputs on demand. So just the act of training a model isn’t a copyright violation, even if the material used was copyrighted.\n\nThe IP coalition has always been “corporations, and a rotation of reactionary artists they tricked”, and this issue is no exception.\n\nFairly Trained launches certification for generative AI models that respect creators’ rights — Fairly Trained We’re pleased that a number of organizations and companies have expressed support for Fairly Trained: the Association of American Publishers, the Association of Independent Music Publishers, Concord, Pro Sound Effects, and Universal Music Group.\n\nThe “Fairly Trained” group proposes to “respect creators’ rights” by coming up with some sort of “certification criteria.” Who’s behind this, you wonder? It’s the same handful of companies who artists are rightfully trying to defend themselves against:\n\nThe Concept Art Association is raising money to hire a lobbyist to take the fight against AI image generators to DC. This is the most solid plan we have yet, support below.\n\nSo, predictably, the “anti-AI” learning rights campaign is the same familiar megacorporations and lobbying groups baiting in and publicly platforming artists, all while arguing for actual policy proposals that enrich themselves at the artists’ expense.\n\nPushes for copyright expansion have always benefited corporations at the expense of artists, but that’s a tough sell. The IP monopolists — the Adobes, the Disneys — need to sell copyright expansion as a measure that “protects artists”, even though it doesn’t.\n\nhuge day for maximizing corporate greed and making it impossible to create art freely without deep pockets and massive IP centralization. thanks karla! you're a piece of shit.\n\nI would love for this to be the absurd hyperbolic speculation it sounds like, but the IP ghouls are already salivating over the idea. The Adobe/Microsoft Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) campaign is a topic for another essay entirely, but it’s bleak. And Adobe and StabilityAI are already pushing the senate to mandate it .\n\nBecause the model isn’t copying the work, you can’t reliably determine what work a model was trained on just by examining the model. So in order to enforce a learning right, you have to prevent training in the first place. And to do that, you need chain-of-custody DRM on basically all information.\n\nAnd even before the environment got as drastic as that, one obvious thing a learning right does is destroy fan work. Since being able to draw a character or environment is obvious evidence that you learned how to do so from the original work, media properties would have an airtight case that any fan works or parody that references their IP is prima facie evidence of unlicensed training on the material. Even in cases where the fanwork itself isn’t infringing any copyright, this work would be evidence of illegal and unlicensed training on material. This would create a back-door way for media companies to control depictions of their own properties, and yet again extort or censor independent artists.\n\nThis would exacerbate all the worst problems in the current media ecosystem. Creative industries would necessarily consolidate around a few powerful rightsholder conglomerates, and new artists would face insurmountable barriers to entry. Even without looming threats of fascism and dystopian control, consolidation would lead (as it does) to sanitization, fewer perspectives, and a less pluralistic culture. Much, much more art would necessarily become a corporate output, censored to whatever standards that might require. This might not effectively “destroy art”, but since corporations would have vast power over cases they cared about, it would un-democratize art where it mattered.\n\nThis would effectively stifle independent artists from creating any new future work. A corporation with a content library can take any work from an individual artist, find the closest work in the library of their own work, and accuse the targeted work of being a product of “unlicensed learning”. An individual artist without a “content library” to draw from would be unable to show that any new work didn’t infringe on this nebulous right. This would give media conglomerates excessive power over artists: they could extort artists for payment or use the threat of a protracted legal battle to selectively censor material they deemed harmful to their own financial interests.\n\nA learning right in particular would be a massive hand-out to media companies like Adobe or stock photo companies who own licenses over vast libraries of images. If people need to license the right to learn from any work in that data set, those companies suddenly have strong grounds to make an argument that almost any new art was derived from art they have exclusive rights over. These companies already have a strong incentive to try to prevent any new competition from being created, so giving them a tool to do exactly that would be disastrous for art.\n\nBut even if artists could realistically keep the rights to their own work, there are other obvious problems with trying to extend copyright such that all work is a “derivative” of the resources used to train the artists.\n\n“AI could really devastate a certain subset of the creative economy, but I don’t think licensing is the way to prevent that,” said Brandon Butler, intellectual property and licensing director at the University of Virginia Library. “Whatever pennies that would flow to somebody from this kind of a license is not going to come close to making up for the disruption that could happen here. And it could put fetters on the development of AI that may be undesirable from a policy point of view.” Butler said AI presents a “creative policy problem” that will likely require a broader approach.\n\nAndrew Albanese, “Authors Join the Brewing Legal Battle Over AI” But a permissions-based licensing solution for written works seems unlikely, lawyers told PW. And more to the point, even if such a system somehow came to pass there are questions about whether it would sufficiently address the potentially massive issues associated with the emergence of generative AI.\n\nThe five publishers, four studios and three record labels know that they are unsympathetic figures when they lobby Congress for more exclusive rights (doubly so right now, after their mustache-twirling denunciations of creative workers picketing outside their gates). The only way they could successfully lobby for another expansion on copyright, an exclusive right to train a model, is by claiming they’re doing it for us — for creative workers. But they hate us. They don’t want to pay us, ever. The only reason they’d lobby for that new AI training right is because they believe — correctly — that they can force us to sign it over to them. The bullies want your kid to get as much lunch money as possible.\n\nIn those circumstances, giving your kid extra lunch money is just an indirect way of giving the bullies more money. … But the individual creative worker who bargains with Disney-ABC-Muppets-Pixar-Marvel-Lucasfilm-Fox is not in a situation comparable to, say, Coca-Cola renewing its sponsorship deal for Disneyland. For an individual worker, the bargain goes like this: “We’ll take everything we can, and give you as little as we can get away with, and maybe we won’t even pay you that.” … Every expansion of copyright over the past forty years — the expansions that made entertainment giants richer as artists got poorer — was enacted in the name of “protecting artists.”\n\nCory Doctorow, Everything Made By an AI Is In the Public Domain Giving more copyright to a creative worker under those circumstances is like giving your bullied schoolkid extra lunch money. It doesn’t matter how much lunch money you give your kid — the bullies are just going to take it.\n\nThis would let the handful of firms that pay creative workers for illustration—like the duopoly that controls nearly all comic book creation, or the monopoly that controls the majority of role-playing games—require illustrators to sign away their model-training rights, and replace their paid illustrators with models. Giant corporations wouldn’t have to pay creators—and the GM at your weekly gaming session couldn’t use an AI model to make a visual aid for a key encounter, nor could a kid make their own comic book using text prompts.\n\nThis would result in the worst of all worlds: the companies that today have cornered the market for creative labor could use AI models to replace their workers, while the individuals who rarely—or never—have cause to commission a creative work would be barred from using AI tools to express themselves.\n\nIf large firms like Getty win the right to control model training, they could simply acquire the training rights to any creative worker hoping to do business with them. And since Getty’s largest single expense is the fees it pays to creative workers—fees that it wouldn’t owe in the event that it could use a model to substitute for its workers’ images—it has a powerful incentive to produce a high-quality model to replace those workers.\n\nIf the right to train a model is contingent on a copyright holder’s permission, then these very large firms could simply amend their boilerplate contracts to require creators to sign away their model-training rights as a condition of doing business. That’s what game companies that employ legions of voice-actors are doing, requiring voice actors to begin every session by recording themselves waiving any right to control whether a model can be trained from their voices.\n\n… Creative labor markets are intensely concentrated: a small number of companies—including Getty—commission millions of works every year from working creators. These companies already enjoy tremendous bargaining power, which means they can subject artists to standard, non-negotiable terms that give the firms too much control, for too little compensation.\n\nKatharine Trendacosta and Cory Doctorow, “AI Art Generators and the Online Image Market” Requiring a person using an AI generator to get a license from everyone who has rights in an image in the training data set is unlikely to eliminate this kind of technology. Rather, it will have the perverse effect of limiting this technology development to the very largest companies, who can assemble a data set by compelling their workers to assign the “training right” as a condition of employment or content creation.\n\nThis dynamic has already been covered thoroughly, to the point where I can cover the topic completely by simply quoting existing work:\n\nIn anticipation of learning rights becoming a real thing, companies like Meta and Adobe are already using whatever dirty tricks they can invent to strip individual creators of those rights and stockpile them for corporate profit.\n\nArtists are already compelled to assign platforms and publishers rights over their creative work as a condition for employment or distribution. If the “learning rights” to your work suddenly become a licensable asset, that doesn’t actually make you richer. That just creates another right companies like Penguin Random House can demand themselves as part of a publishing contract, and then resell to AI companies without you ever seeing a dime from it.\n\nCreating a learning right would create a new licensable right, and so seems like this would create a new valuable asset creators could own. But think about what happens to the rights creators already have: huge media companies already own most of “the rights” to work, because they’re able to demand artists relinquish them in order to participate in the system at all. This is the Chokepoint Capitalism thesis .\n\nWhen the question is very hard, and all the general systems of power are pointed in the wrong direction, “We have to take immediate action to fix this!” is a wrong and very dangerous response. Anti-AI artists are supporting copyright as the thing it’s supposed to be , but the power they try to give it goes to a system of power that works against them instead.\n\nTrying to enclose and commodify information so that only people who can pay a competitive market rate won’t somehow disadvantage the corporations. Setting up a system that requires you to be optimally efficient at converting information to US dollars is not going to give the common man a leg up.\n\nAll the systems of power involved in IP enforcement that currently exist are heavily, heavily weighted in the favor of large corporations. The most basic example of this is that going through a legally-adjudicated copyright dispute in the courts can be made into a battle of attrition, and so the companies that can afford extensive legal expenses can simply outspend individuals in disputes. This makes any expansion of copyright automatically benefit corporations over small artists, just procedurally. Massively strengthening copyright enforcement power is not going to help the artists whose work is being used when the powers being enforced are already slanted to disadvantage those artists.\n\nPeople are using the threat of AI to argue for new copyright expansions in order to protect artists from exploitation. But this misunderstands a fundamental dynamic, which is that expanding copyright in general is bad for artists because of the way the system is weighted in favor of corporations against individuals.\n\nThe reason I care about the “philosophy of copyright” or whatever isn’t to invent a reason to let harm continue to be done unabated. Systems matter because systems affect reality, and understanding the mechanics is necessary to keep a reactionary response from doing more harm. Even if you want to “cheat” and get something done right now, the “break-glass” workarounds just aren’t pragmatic.\n\nThis is a common problem with reactionary movements. There’s an earnest, almost panicked energy that there’s a need to “get something done”, but if that energy goes to the wrong place, you’re just doing unnecessary harm.\n\nThere’s also a bigger-picture reason the learning rights approach is bad, even for the people still convinced copyright law should be expanded to include learning rights: doing this would not accomplish the things they want to accomplish, and instead make the world worse for everyone. And, importantly, it won’t eliminate the technology or keep corporations from abusing artist labor, which are the outcomes the people pushing for change want.\n\nIdentifying the labor problem\n\nWhen there’s a legitimate problem to be addressed, ruling out one approach doesn’t mean you’re done with the work; it means you haven’t even identified the work that needs to be done yet. So if copyright expansion isn’t the answer, what’s the right way to address the concern?\n\nLet’s look at that original complaint one more time:\n\nWhen a corporation trains generative AI, they have unfairly used other people’s work without consent or compensation to create a new product they own. Worse, the new product directly competes with the original workers. Since the corporations didn’t own the original material and weren’t granted any specific rights to use it for training, they did not have the right to train with it. When the work was published, there was no expectation it would be used like this, as the technology didn’t exist and people did not even consider “training” as a possibility. Ultimately, the material is copyrighted, and this action violates the authors’ copyright.\n\nFundamentally, the complaint here isn’t about copyright. What’s being (rightfully!) objected to is a new kind of labor issue.\n\nCorporations unfairly competing with workers: labor issue. Use of new technology to displace the workers who enabled it: labor issue. Using new methods to extract additional value from work without compensation: labor issue.\n\nAI threatens to put creative workers out of a job, and make the world a worse place as it does so:\n\nXe Iaso, Soylent Green is people My livelihood is made by thinking really hard about something and then rending a chunk of my soul out to the public. If I can’t do that anymore because a machine that doesn’t need to sleep, eat, pay rent, have a life, get sick, or have a family can do it 80% as good as I can for 20% of the cost, what the hell am I supposed to do if I want to eat?\n\nBuilding highly profitable new tools without compensation is simply unfair:\n\nAG Statement on Writers’ Lawsuits Against OpenAI - The Authors Guild Using books and other copyrighted works to build highly profitable generative AI technologies without the consent or compensation of the authors of those works is blatantly unfair\n\nCorporations are entirely willing to be “disrespectful” in the way they use available labor without consent and compensation, and are doing so in a way that’s entirely willing to harm workers:\n\nAnnie Gilbertson, Apple, Nvidia, Anthropic Used Thousands of Swiped YouTube Videos to Train AI Wiskus said it’s “disrespectful” to use creators’ work without their consent, especially since studios may use “generative AI to replace as many of the artists along the way as they can.”\n\nThe fear with copyrightabillity of AI-generated expressive works is destroying demand, displacing creative jobs, and exacerbating income inequalities:\n\nAnnie Gilbertson, Apple, Nvidia, Anthropic Used Thousands of Swiped YouTube Videos to Train AI “It’s still the sheer principle of it,” said Dave Farina, the host of “Professor Dave Explains,” whose channel showcasing chemistry and other science tutorials has 3 million subscribers and had 140 videos lifted for YouTube Subtitles. “If you’re profiting off of work that I’ve done [to build a product] that will put me out of work or people like me out of work, then there needs to be a conversation on the table about compensation or some kind of regulation,” he said.\n\nAndrew Tarantola, “Modern copyright law can’t keep pace with thinking machines” The fear, [Ben] Sobel explains, is that the subsequent, AI-generated work will supplant the market for the original. “We’re concerned about the ways in which particular works are used, how it would affect demand for that work,” he said. “It’s not inconceivable to imagine that we would see the rise of the technology that could threaten not just the individual work on which it is trained,” Sobel continued. “But also, looking forward, could generate stuff that threatens the authors of those works.” Therefore, he argued to IPW, “If expressive machine learning threatens to displace human authors, it seems unfair to train AI on copyrighted works without compensating the authors of those works.”\n\nEven when Meta pirates artists’ work outright, the piracy complaint isn’t really about piracy. The objection isn’t to the use (since people aren’t as critical individuals engaging in the same piracy), it’s that the work is being used to make money in a way that’s directly harmful to the workers who enabled that profit. It’s about unfair competition.\n\nCrouchingPenguinHiddenSword @sgtwaddles42.bsky.social Using this as an example—not calling this poster out specifically—since I've seen this a few times in the replies: Very few of the responses are critical of LibGen or its normal users The complaint is that Meta created a product, \"AI\", to *make money* off *their* works w/o paying *them* 2025-03-21T01:23:52.145Z\n\nThere is a fairness problem here. It just doesn’t have anything to do with copyright. It’s labor.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s a much harder policy sell. Copyright is a neutral-sounding enforcement mechanism. It’s fluid enough that corporations, lawmakers, and artists can sometimes be found arguing on the same side, even if the artists are getting duped. Labor is a much more divisive word. Lobbying has trained people to turn off their brains as soon as they hear the word, and fair labor proposals are rarely even crafted, let alone considered.\n\nBut the difference between copyright expansion and labor rights is the latter option actually addresses the complaint. It’d be nice if there were an easy salve, but given the choice between something hard that works and something easy that makes things worse, you’re obligated to push the former.\n\nOne interesting proposal I’ve seen is a copyright exception that explicitly puts work produced with generative AI into the public domain. This would specifically be a poison pill to defend against worker exploitation, and I think it’s an interesting idea. But this would have to be specifically understood as a labor measure to discourage the replacement of artists. Simply interpreting existing copyright policy won’t make this happen by itself, even if computer generated art isn’t copyrightable, because the human creativity involved in arranging and guiding AI outputs will be enough to qualify for copyright without an explicit poison pill policy.\n\nFortunately, making sure AI is only used in ways that are fair to the workers who enable it is an idea that’s picked up serious traction in the space of union negotiations. Just to zoom in on one group, SAG-AFTRA has made AI one of its key issues.\n\nAI was a key issue in the SAG-AFTRA TV negotiations, which included the 2023 TV strike. The final contract for TV workers included provisions requiring informed consent and limited scope, so studios would be required to pay people based on roles played, whether AI is used in the process or not.\n\nBut the fight continues for other workers, like voice actors and video game acting. As early as September 2023, the SAG-AFTRA union authorized striking action against video game companies over the issue of fair compensation for AI:\n\nSAG-AFTRA Members Approve Video Game Strike Authorization Vote With 98.32% Yes Vote | SAG-AFTRA SAG-AFTRA members have voted 98.32% in favor of a strike authorization on the Interactive Media Agreement that covers members’ work on video games. … “After five rounds of bargaining, it has become abundantly clear that the video game companies aren’t willing to meaningfully engage on the critical issues: compensation undercut by inflation, unregulated use of AI and safety,” said SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. “I remain hopeful that we will be able to reach an agreement that meets members’ needs, but our members are done being exploited, and if these corporations aren’t willing to offer a fair deal, our next stop will be the picket lines.” “Between the exploitative uses of AI and lagging wages, those who work in video games are facing many of the same issues as those who work in film and television,” said Chief Contracts Officer Ray Rodriguez. “This strike authorization makes an emphatic statement that we must reach an agreement that will fairly compensate these talented performers, provide common-sense safety measures, and allow them to work with dignity. Our members’ livelihoods depend on it.”\n\nThe union didn’t back down on this issue, and went on strike in July 2024 over this issue in particular:\n\nStephen Totilo, “Video game actors to go on strike over AI” Video game voice and performance actors will go on strike a minute after midnight (Pacific) tonight, citing an impasse after 21 months of negotiations between the SAG-AFTRA union and major western video game companies, for a new deal. The sticking point, it seems, is generative AI and concerns that it can be trained to create synthetic voices that would cost actors’ jobs. “We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members,” SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said in a statement.\n\nMember Message: Video Game Strike Update | SAG-AFTRA We encourage you to read this extensive updated comparison chart of A.I. proposals to see for yourself how far apart we remain on fundamental A.I. protections for all performers. They want to use all past performances and any performance they can source from outside the contract without any of the protections being bargained at all. You could be told nothing about your replica being used, offered nothing in the way of payment, and you could do nothing about it. They want to be able to make your replica continue to work, as you, during a future strike, whether you like it or not. And once you’ve given your specific consent for how your replica can be used, they refuse to tell you what they actually did with it.\n\nContract negotiations are a good place to work this out. There are ways to use AI that are fair to workers and ways to use AI that are unfair and exploitative. And the question at hand is whether companies have to pay artists or not, which isn’t something that can be left to corporate discretion.\n\nThe idea of a learning right is such a fundamentally bad idea, I think a valid way to interpret it is not as a serious proposal in the first place, but rather a mutual-destruction threat by tech companies who are intentionally moving the conversation away from labor rights. The amount of copyright expansion necessary to create an enforceable right to control how people learn from published work is absurd, and would devastate the creative industries.\n\nAI companies are pushing the idea that copyright expansion is the only way to prevent a new category of worker exploitation they’ve invented. They’re waving around the poison pill of copyright expansion around so it looks the only way to defend against unfair exploitation is crippling expression. All of that distracts from the fact that the real danger is unfair exploitation of artistic labor, and labor law could directly address the problem. It’s harder work, but unlike the candy-coated copyright expansion posion-pill proposals, it won’t actively destroy the artists it’s claiming to protect."}

With elite clubs across Europe keeping t… [+4196 chars]", "title": "Liverpool ‘Confident’ in Beating Man City in the Race to Sign £60m Bundesliga Star – Report", "fullContent": "Liverpool Confident of Xavi Simons Coup Amid Man City Rivalry\n\nLiverpool are reportedly feeling “confident” about beating Manchester City to the signature of RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons this summer, according to Caught Offside. With elite clubs across Europe keeping tabs on the Dutch wonderkid, the Merseyside giants believe they hold a unique edge in the race for one of football’s most exciting prospects.\n\nDutch Connections Give Liverpool the Edge\n\nSimons, just 21, has become one of Europe’s most coveted young midfielders, with a potential price tag of €70 million, per Caught Offside. While Manchester City are eager to line him up as a long-term successor to Kevin De Bruyne, Liverpool’s internal belief that they can pull off this deal stems from something more personal than money or prestige — national camaraderie.\n\nWith Dutch stars Virgil van Dijk, Cody Gakpo, and Ryan Gravenberch already at Anfield — not to mention fellow countryman Arne Slot taking the reins from Jurgen Klopp — Liverpool feel this shared heritage could be pivotal.\n\n“Liverpool and Manchester City are among Simons’ main suitors at the moment, though the Reds feel their Dutch connection could give them a key advantage,” the article notes. It’s a valid strategy — players are often swayed not just by wages or Champions League football, but by environment, familiarity and trust in leadership.\n\nLuis Diaz Future Adds Context\n\nOne of the more intriguing side notes to this rumour surrounds Luis Diaz. While Caught Offside claim that some figures at the club are eager to keep the Colombian winger, new boss Arne Slot is believed to have “some reservations about the player.”\n\nThat statement raises eyebrows. Diaz has been a fan favourite at times, but his performances have blown hot and cold since joining from Porto. With Barcelona and Saudi Pro League clubs circling, Liverpool might see now as the ideal time to cash in — particularly if they can secure an upgrade.\n\nSimons, who has flourished in the Bundesliga and has Champions League experience under his belt, could provide the creative thrust from wide or central areas that Slot is believed to value. In a tactical sense, he’s a versatile option capable of injecting something different into Liverpool’s attack.\n\nCity Facing a Kevin De Bruyne-Sized Hole\n\nOn the blue half of Manchester, there’s a growing sense of urgency. Kevin De Bruyne has confirmed his departure from the Etihad this summer, ending a glorious chapter at City. As Caught Offside put it, “those will be some very big boots to fill.”\n\nSimons is one of the few young players in Europe who could feasibly take on that mantle in a Pep Guardiola system — combining vision, dribbling, and positional intelligence. Yet the fact that City are in a more transitional moment, with an ageing core and tactical shifts on the horizon, may make Liverpool’s pitch all the more appealing.\n\nFederico Chiesa Another Potential Departure?\n\nIt’s also worth noting the mention of Federico Chiesa, who could be moved on after a “difficult first season in English football.” The forward has massively struggled for fitness and game time since his £12m move from Juventus last summer.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nLet’s be real: this is exactly the kind of transfer that gets the Kop buzzing.\n\nXavi Simons isn’t just hype — he’s got the technical quality, flair, and tactical discipline to shine in a high-intensity Liverpool side. Watching him glide past defenders and whip in a cross or pick a line-breaking pass? That’s Anfield theatre.\n\nMore than anything, this feels like a statement from Arne Slot and the recruitment team. Moving on from the Jurgen Klopp era was never going to be easy, but bringing in a player like Simons signals real intent. It tells the rest of Europe that Liverpool are not stepping back — they’re evolving.\n\nAnd let’s not ignore the Dutch connection. This isn’t just a PR angle — players do care about having compatriots around, especially in such an intense, demanding environment. Van Dijk’s leadership, Gakpo’s support, Gravenberch’s camaraderie — that’s a locker room foundation that could genuinely help Simons settle and thrive.\n\nIf it comes down to cold strategy, Simons might lean toward City. But if it comes down to heart, heritage, and playing in front of the best fans in the world at Anfield? Then this could be Liverpool’s biggest midfield signing since Thiago. And unlike Thiago, Simons has a whole decade ahead of him.\n\nOne word: YES."}

In his official matchday programme notes, Virgil van Dijk captures the gravity of the moment with measured dignity.\n\n“Sunday is an important one for Liverpool Football Club, both on and off the field,” Van Dijk writes, acknowledging the 36th anniversary of the Hillsborough tragedy. “You are in our thoughts, on this day and always.”\n\nIt’s a poignant reminder that some things are bigger than results. Anfield will pay tribute to the 97 supporters who lost their lives in 1989, and that emotion is sure to be felt on and off the pitch. The Kop will form a mosaic, tributes will flood the LED boards, and hearts will swell with remembrance and resolve.\n\nTaking Responsibility and Reacting the Right Way\n\nOn the pitch, the message from Liverpool’s captain is just as powerful. After a frustrating 3-2 defeat to Fulham last weekend, Van Dijk didn’t hide behind excuses.\n\n“It was a poor day at the office for us, no doubt, and we have to take it on the chin,” he says plainly, with the kind of candour supporters admire.\n\nLiverpool’s title challenge suffered a dent at Craven Cottage, but Van Dijk’s words are not those of a man rattled. They’re of a leader who understands the stakes and the standards required to stay in the fight.\n\n“We need to make sure we are ready from the first minute against West Ham,” he continues. It’s not just about playing well—it’s about setting the tone from the start and sustaining it until the final whistle.\n\nMentality, Momentum and a Message to the Squad\n\nVan Dijk doesn’t waver from his consistent theme this season: mentality is everything. “There is still a big job to be done,” he insists. “Everything starts with hard work.”\n\nThese are not hollow platitudes. They echo a reality that’s become increasingly clear: Liverpool cannot afford lapses in intensity. The Premier League punishes complacency, and Fulham offered a sharp lesson in that regard.\n\nVan Dijk reminds his teammates—and perhaps even the fans—that no title is won in April. “We know exactly what is required over the coming weeks,” he says. “We must be together, fully focused and ready to give absolutely everything for the cause.”\n\nExpecting a Response Against West Ham\n\nSunday is not just a chance for redemption, but an opportunity to reaffirm Liverpool’s credentials in front of a passionate Anfield crowd. Van Dijk is under no illusion about the threat West Ham pose, regardless of their mid-table position.\n\n“They have players that can hurt you if you are not at the right level,” he warns.\n\nIt’s a fair assessment. This is not a time for half-measures or slow starts. Van Dijk wants unity, energy, and a “big atmosphere” to lift the team.\n\n“We hear you and we feel you,” he tells the supporters. “So be loud, be noisy and let’s make life as hard as we possibly can for our opponents.”\n\nThe message is clear: the title charge isn’t over, but it needs everyone—players and fans alike—pulling in the same direction.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThis is exactly what we needed to hear from the captain.\n\nVirgil van Dijk’s leadership has been a beacon throughout this season, and once again he’s struck the perfect tone—measured, respectful, and full of belief. After a slip-up like Fulham, it’s easy to spiral into panic or point fingers. But Van Dijk reminds us that this team’s foundation is built on mentality and togetherness.\n\nThere’s something incredibly powerful about the way he ties the Hillsborough tribute to the performance required on the pitch. It’s not about pressure—it’s about honour. Playing for Liverpool means playing with heart, especially on days like this.\n\nArne Slot’s men know what’s at stake, and if this message from the captain doesn’t spark fire, nothing will. We’ve seen this team respond before. We’ve seen Anfield roar back into life when we need it most. Sunday has all the ingredients for a statement.\n\nAnd let’s be honest—we want this one. We want to show that Fulham was a blip, not a trend. We want to play with the kind of fury and focus that makes rivals nervous again. All eyes on Sunday. Let’s answer the call, from first whistle to last."}

On the latest ChatG&G episode by Anfield Index, hosts Gags Tandon and Grizz Khan dissected what this means for the Reds moving forward, both on and off the pitch.\n\nSalah’s Signature Speaks Volumes\n\nMohamed Salah’s decision to extend his stay is far more than a mere retention of a world-class footballer. As Grizz Khan remarked, “We need to speak about our legends… I can’t shut up when Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk are about to sign new contracts that will tie them down to this club.” His passion mirrored the sentiment of a fanbase that knows just how rare it is to have such icons wearing red.\n\nOpposition respect was also palpable. Gags noted that a Nottingham Forest full-back recently said, “Oh my God, Salah staying – the world’s in trouble.” This isn’t just a Liverpool triumph – it’s a message across the league. As Grizz said, “Every defence when Salah’s coming on the pitch, they’re all like a bit nervous. What the hell is he going to do this time?”\n\nLiverpool’s League Statement\n\nWhile rival fans have tried to downplay Liverpool’s title credentials, Gags was unequivocal: “Just winning the league? I laugh every time they say that.” He continued, “Yes, the league that Arsenal haven’t won for 20 years. The league that United haven’t won since when? Ten, twelve years?”\n\nGrizz highlighted the psychological edge Liverpool possesses. “Every player when he plays Liverpool – it’s a window of opportunity. It’s a chance to make a name for yourself.” That intensity, he explained, can be draining, and without fresh legs in January, the team has struggled with fatigue: “We won every single game almost up until Jan in sprinting… and since then, we’ve been getting outworked by everyone.”\n\nTactical Shift Under Arne Slot\n\nThe post-Klopp era is officially underway, and with Arne Slot now at the helm, Gags pointed to an evolution in tactical approach. “Klopp’s squad was built on outworking the opposition. Slot is a little more tactical – he can control the game more.” However, there remains a demand for reinforcements: “We need some legs… players he can trust.”\n\nThe Salah news is a foundation. “We’re sending a message to the rest of the league that this is actually done now – properly done – and the boys are staying,” Gags added. Grizz, meanwhile, acknowledged, “I want to enjoy a football match again… and I’d really like us to blitz them in the first half.”\n\nCherish This Era\n\nPerhaps the most poignant takeaway was a reminder from Grizz to appreciate this era. “Cherish these moments. These moments are few and far between… This is a glorious time to be a Liverpool fan.”\n\nThe podcast hosts spoke as fans first, but with clarity and weight that underscores the significance of Salah’s extension. For Liverpool, it’s about more than goals or assists – it’s about building an era that will be remembered, respected, and hopefully repeated."}

As part of… [+4731 chars]", "title": "Fabrizio Romano says Liverpool Star Could Leave This Summer and is One to ‘Keep an Eye On’", "fullContent": "Jarell Quansah’s Future at Liverpool: Will the Defender Depart in the Summer?\n\nThe upcoming summer transfer window is set to be an exciting one for Liverpool FC, with manager Arne Slot looking to strengthen his squad ahead of a potential Premier League title defence. As part of this squad revamp, several new signings are expected, but equally important is the outgoings list. One player who could be heading for the Anfield exit is young defender Jarell Quansah.\n\nThis is according to reliable journalist Fabrizio Romano, who provided an update on Quansah’s future during his latest episode of the Here We Go Podcast. Romano pointed out that the 21-year-old, despite his talent, could be one of the players leaving Liverpool in the summer transfer window, with clubs from both the Premier League and Bundesliga reportedly showing interest. Romano’s comments raise key questions about Quansah’s standing in Slot’s plans for the coming season.\n\nQuansah’s Struggle for First-Team Opportunities\n\nJarell Quansah has been on Liverpool’s books for a few years now, but his opportunities in the first team have been limited. The young Englishman has made only 11 appearances across all competitions this season, failing to cement a regular starting spot under Slot. While Slot has praised Quansah’s abilities in the past, it appears that the defender has yet to win the manager’s full trust. This has been evident in recent matches where Quansah has found himself sidelined in favour of players like Curtis Jones, who has been deployed in an unconventional full-back role.\n\nRomano’s insight into Quansah’s situation highlights a growing concern for the player’s future at Liverpool. “I’ll keep an eye on Jarell Quansah because he is very good and very talented,” Romano said. However, he went on to add, “But I think sometimes you want to play. So you have Virgil van Dijk and the contract. Ibrahima Konate is still there; there is interest in Dean Huijsen. Liverpool have many players in that position.”\n\nTransfer Window and Liverpool’s Defensive Depth\n\nWith several defensive options already available to Arne Slot, Quansah’s chances of breaking into the first team appear slim. Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate are both established starters, and the potential addition of players like Bournemouth’s Dean Huijsen only adds further competition for places. This creates a situation where Quansah may have to look elsewhere to find regular playing time.\n\n“It is true that injuries are part of the game. We have many games, as always, in modern football,” Romano continued. “But Jarell Quansah is attracting interest from several clubs. Newcastle, from what I’m hearing, but also German clubs. That is the information I can tell you. I’m told there is also interest from the Bundesliga.”\n\nWill Liverpool Cash in on Quansah?\n\nWhile Slot has expressed admiration for Quansah in the past, it seems increasingly likely that the young defender could be sold in the upcoming transfer window. The club may opt to cash in on Quansah, particularly if the player himself is keen on a move to secure more first-team football elsewhere. “I think there will be movement for Quansah,” Romano predicted. “I think he is one of the players that Liverpool will consider to cash in if the player wants to go and try something new.”\n\nLiverpool’s willingness to part ways with Quansah could also be a strategic move to balance the squad and potentially fund new arrivals. The summer transfer window promises to be a pivotal one for Slot and his team, as Liverpool aim to build a squad capable of competing at the highest level.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nJarell Quansah’s potential departure this summer is a bittersweet prospect. On one hand, there’s no denying his talent and potential; the young defender has shown promise when given the chance. However, the reality of competing for a spot in the Liverpool defence, with stalwarts like Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate already ahead of him, makes it difficult to imagine him getting the regular game time he deserves at Anfield.\n\nMany fans may feel that Quansah’s situation highlights the depth and strength of Liverpool’s defensive options, but there’s a sense of disappointment that the young player hasn’t been able to carve out a more substantial role. With the arrival of new defensive talents on the horizon, the prospect of Quansah leaving seems inevitable, and while it’s a shame, it could be the best move for his development. If he truly wants to secure first-team football, a fresh challenge elsewhere might be the best option.\n\nAs for Liverpool, the club needs to ensure that any sale of Quansah is balanced with the acquisition of players who can provide both depth and quality in defence. Slot’s focus must remain on building a squad that can defend well and compete for the title, with or without Quansah in the fold. Ultimately, the decision will come down to the player’s desire for more playtime and whether Liverpool can secure the right deal."}

After a challenging debut season under Arne Slot, the Italian international is now reportedly attracting transfer interest from across Europe — most notably AC Milan and three unnamed Premier League sides.\n\nAccording to a CaughtOffside exclusive, sources “with a close understanding of the situation” have confirmed that Chiesa has emerged as a summer target for the Rossoneri. It’s also suggested that “a return to Serie A could be an option for Chiesa again this summer as he’s continued to struggle to work his way into Arne Slot’s plans.”\n\nThe winger, who joined Liverpool with high expectations following an often electric spell at Juventus, has found himself on the periphery at Anfield. Though he turned down a move to Napoli in January, circumstances appear to have shifted dramatically in recent months.\n\nTransfer Value Set Between €25-30 Million\n\nLiverpool are reportedly prepared to listen to offers in the region of €25–30million/£21.7million for the 27-year-old, a figure that reflects both Chiesa’s pedigree and the sense of underachievement in his first Premier League campaign. While that price could deter some, it might be viewed as a calculated risk by a club willing to revive the player’s fortunes.\n\nAs CaughtOffside notes, “it perhaps seems hard to imagine there’ll be too many clubs willing to pay that, so it will be interesting to see if LFC end up backing down a bit after negotiations.”\n\nWith just a handful of standout performances and limited minutes in crucial fixtures, Chiesa has failed to displace any of the established front-line names at Liverpool. Slot already boasts attacking talent in Mohamed Salah, Luis Díaz, Diogo Jota, and Cody Gakpo, meaning opportunities have been scarce.\n\nAC Milan Lead Continental Interest\n\nAC Milan’s interest signals a potential lifeline in Italy. Chiesa’s familiarity with Serie A, where he made his name at Fiorentina and Juventus, could make a return appealing for both player and club. His previous injury troubles may temper expectations, but Milan, in need of fresh attacking impetus, appear ready to make a calculated gamble.\n\nCaughtOffside’s article explains that “Chiesa previously shone at Juventus, even if he had some injury issues during his time there, so it’s easy to see why a big name like Milan might be willing to gamble on him.”\n\nThe unnamed Premier League clubs, meanwhile, remain a wildcard. Though no details were revealed in the report, their interest suggests Chiesa’s talent is still recognised despite his muted Anfield stint.\n\nFuture Uncertain as Summer Nears\n\nLiverpool fans will remember Chiesa’s signing with cautious optimism. The deal was heralded as a savvy move — a proven international with Champions League experience. But football moves quickly. Just one season later, the narrative has shifted from hopeful integration to possible offload.\n\n“Chiesa had been keen to give his time at Liverpool more of a chance,” CaughtOffside reported, “but it now seems very clear that it’s just not working out for the 27-year-old.”\n\nIt’s an unfortunate twist for both club and player, though few would argue that Chiesa hasn’t been given a fair chance. If a sale materialises, it will be viewed more as a reshuffling of depth than a dramatic loss for Liverpool.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor many Liverpool fans, this Federico Chiesa saga feels like a case of what might have been. On paper, he ticked every box: pace, directness, tactical intelligence, and Champions League pedigree. But in practice, it seems the adaptation to English football — and perhaps Arne Slot’s system — just didn’t click.\n\nSupporters might ask: did he really get enough of a chance? Slot, in his first season, has understandably leaned on players more familiar with the league and with each other. With Salah still ever-reliable and Díaz offering width, Chiesa was often left fighting for scraps.\n\nThe fee being discussed — €25–30 million — might actually appeal to Liverpool’s recruitment team. It could be reinvested into a player better suited to Slot’s structure or used to bolster another area of the squad.\n\nBut let’s not sugar-coat it — there will be disappointment. Chiesa’s quality isn’t in doubt. Fans will remember glimpses of his brilliance, like the goal against Newcastle, and wonder if a second season could have unlocked his best. Unfortunately, in a club constantly striving for perfection, patience is a luxury rarely afforded.\n\nIf AC Milan or another side offers the right deal, it seems likely Chiesa will depart. Perhaps he’ll thrive again in Italy — and Liverpool fans will be left hoping this isn’t another case of a player shining only after leaving Anfield."}

With just weeks remaining in the title race, every selection call and return from injury carries significant weight.\n\nAlisson and Bradley Boost for Liverpool\n\nArne Slot will be pleased to call upon Alisson Becker once again, as the Brazilian goalkeeper returns following his absence due to concussion protocols. Having missed Liverpool’s last two fixtures, his availability provides much-needed assurance between the posts.\n\nSlot confirmed on Friday: “Alisson has been cleared to play,” ending speculation about whether the club would continue with Caoimhín Kelleher, who has deputised admirably but was part of the side that fell 3-2 at Fulham last week.\n\nAnother significant return comes in the form of Conor Bradley. The Northern Irish full-back was back in action as a substitute against Fulham, and Slot indicated he’s in contention for a starting role on Sunday.\n\n“Yes, it does,” Slot replied when asked if Bradley’s performance and week of training made him a viable option. “Of course it’s a boost, it’s always a boost when quality players come back… and Conor has done so well for us this season, just like Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. But when Trent then isn’t there, you always hope to look behind you and see that Conor is available.”\n\nStill, the Reds remain without both Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez. The right side of Liverpool’s defence will be an area to watch, with Bradley likely asked to fill significant shoes in a game where defensive stability will be crucial.\n\nVan Dijk Milestone Adds Leadership Edge\n\nVirgil van Dijk is poised to captain Liverpool for the 100th time in the Premier League, a remarkable feat underscoring his role as both a defensive lynchpin and a vocal leader. The Dutchman has now started 64 consecutive league matches — a record that speaks volumes about his durability and consistency, particularly amid Liverpool’s frequently rotated back line.\n\nHis presence will be essential not just for marshalling the defence, but for providing composure as Liverpool continue their pursuit of domestic silverware.\n\nWest Ham United Unchanged but Focused\n\nGraham Potter, now steering West Ham United through a steady campaign, reported no new injury setbacks. While Michail Antonio, Aaron Cresswell and Crysencio Summerville remain sidelined, the squad otherwise remains stable heading into the Anfield clash.\n\nNiclas Fullkrug has been monitored in training this week but is expected to be fit. “No major issues from the previous match,” Potter noted. “Fullkrug has a little bit of not fatigue but [we are] just making sure he’s OK after the weekend.”\n\nPotter is under no illusions about the challenge that awaits in Merseyside. “We have to make sure we’re resilient, make sure we’re the best version of ourselves. Because if we are then we’ll be competitive and that’s the most important thing.”\n\nIt’s a pragmatic assessment, and one that reflects both realism and quiet ambition. West Ham have shown they can play progressive football under Potter, and with players like Lucas Paquetá and Jarrod Bowen in strong form, they’ll look to capitalise on any lapses from the league leaders.\n\nTactical Considerations and Match Outlook\n\nLiverpool’s defeat at Craven Cottage will sting, but at home they remain formidable. The midfield trio of Gravenberch, Mac Allister and Szoboszlai will be expected to control the tempo, particularly against a West Ham side that can transition quickly. Bradley’s inclusion could allow more natural width and defensive balance compared to the makeshift deployment of Curtis Jones.\n\nWest Ham, who drew 2-2 with Bournemouth last time out, may not be setting the league alight, but they’ve avoided defeat in four of their last six. With tactical flexibility and a relatively healthy squad, they could frustrate Liverpool — provided they can weather the early storm.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAnfield is never a kind venue for visiting sides, but West Ham will take confidence from their recent form and Liverpool’s defensive vulnerabilities. For Slot’s side, this is about reasserting dominance and keeping their title hopes firmly alive.\n\nExpect a tight, tactical affair — and with Alisson and Bradley back, Liverpool will believe they’ve got the edge."}

This Premier League fixture not only sees the league leaders continue their pursuit of the title but also celebrates individual milestones that reflect the club’s current evolution under Arne Slot. Credit to liverpoolfc.com for compiling the original statistical breakdown which offers compelling insights ahead of the clash.\n\nSlot’s Stellar Start to Life at Anfield\n\nArne Slot will mark his 50th match in charge of Liverpool this weekend – a landmark that, remarkably, comes with the Dutchman having won 35 of his first 49 fixtures. That’s a club record, surpassing even managerial greats like Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish, who each won 29 of their first 50 games.\n\nSlot has revitalised the Reds with an energetic, controlled approach that balances pressing with possession. His squad, efficient in both attack and defence, has scored and conceded exactly the same number of goals as at this stage last season (72 for, 30 against), but crucially, they now boast two more points.\n\nThe consistency under Slot at Anfield is palpable. “Slot’s men have won each of their last five Premier League fixtures at Anfield – the Reds last won more in a row in December 2023 (seven),” the club noted. That form will be critical with the title race reaching its business end.\n\nHistoric Dominance Over West Ham\n\nLiverpool have been ruthless in recent meetings with the Hammers. Not only have they won each of the last nine matches against them at Anfield, but they’ve also lost just one of their last 57 home games versus West Ham in all competitions – a staggering record (won 42, drawn 14).\n\nThis season alone, the Reds have already put five goals past West Ham twice – 5-1 in the Carabao Cup and 5-0 in the league. As pointed out by Liverpoolfc.com: “No English top-flight team has ever scored five or more goals against another three times in the same campaign before.” Could history be made once again?\n\nKey Men in Red\n\nThe narrative wouldn’t be complete without spotlighting some individual brilliance. Mohamed Salah, ever-reliable in big games, has a remarkable record against West Ham: 11 goals and five assists in 14 Premier League starts. Only Manchester United and Newcastle have suffered more at his hands.\n\nLuis Diaz is also enjoying a strong run, having contributed to a goal in each of his last four league outings – “the longest ever run of goal involvements by a Colombian in the competition.” With Salah and Diaz in sync, the Hammers’ backline will need to be flawless.\n\nDiogo Jota’s habit of impacting this fixture from the bench is worth noting too. All three of his Premier League goals against West Ham have come as a substitute – and he’s scored in his last two league games against them. Slot may yet have another ace up his sleeve.\n\nWarning Signs from the Hammers\n\nWhile Liverpool’s dominance is clear, West Ham do pose threats. Jarrod Bowen, who has either scored or assisted six of West Ham’s last seven goals against Liverpool, remains a menace. He’s been directly involved in more goals against the Reds than any other player since the start of 2023-24.\n\nManager Graham Potter’s personal record at Anfield should also not be overlooked. He’s unbeaten in his last three league visits – two with Brighton and one with Chelsea. Only Sam Allardyce has avoided defeat more frequently in recent times, doing so four times between 2016 and 2020.\n\nAnd while West Ham are winless in 11 Sunday away games, the unpredictability of Premier League football means no stat can be taken for granted.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThere’s an air of optimism swirling around the red half of Merseyside. Slot’s 50th game feels symbolic – not just of how far Liverpool have come since Jurgen Klopp’s departure, but of how seamlessly they’ve adapted to a new era. The data doesn’t lie: a better win percentage, more points, and still in control of their title destiny.\n\nVirgil van Dijk captaining the side for the 100th time in the Premier League adds an emotional weight. The Dutchman has not only returned to his imperious best, but he’s become the spiritual successor to past leaders like Gerrard and Henderson – calming, commanding, and crucial.\n\nFrom a fan’s perspective, the potential to make history – scoring five or more goals against the same top-flight side three times in one season – is mouth-watering. But it’s not just about statistics. This squad is peaking at the right time, with depth, chemistry, and belief.\n\nYes, West Ham have Bowen and a smart manager, but this is Anfield in April. The Kop roars louder, expectations grow higher, and Liverpool – under Slot – look ready to rise to every challenge. Three points here would not only strengthen their title push, but send a message: this team isn’t just adapting post-Klopp; they’re evolving."}

This substantial movement aligns with the broader market trend, which saw a 5.4% rise in the same period. With the market also showing positive momentum over the last 12 months and anticipating a 14% annual earnings growth, General Dynamics’ performance reflects investor optimism. Any firm-specific news from this period could have added to the positive sentiment but would have been supportive rather than the primary drivers of the upward trend, given the strong market-wide ascent.\n\nGeneral Dynamics has 1 warning sign we think you should know about.\n\nNYSE:GD Earnings Per Share Growth as at Apr 2025\n\nDiversify your portfolio with solid dividend payers offering reliable income streams to weather potential market turbulence.\n\nThe recent 10.7% increase in General Dynamics' share price aligns with broader market momentum, signaling growing investor confidence. Over the past five years, General Dynamics has delivered a total return of 125.13%, including dividends, indicating consistent long-term performance. Compared to the market's performance over the past year, General Dynamics underperformed with a 3.6% return, showcasing challenges in keeping pace with industry levels.\n\nThis positive news might bolster General Dynamics' revenue and earnings projections, particularly given the expected demand for Gulfstream aircraft and submarine programs. Currently, revenue stands at US$47.72 billion, with earnings at US$3.78 billion. Analyst forecasts suggest revenue growth of 4.2% annually and increased profit margins over the next three years, potentially enhancing future earnings.

Find out more about how we test.\n\nRayNeo has been quickly iterating on its line of augmented reality glasses. While the company’s glasses don’t boast the rich feature set of competitors like Xreal, pricing tends to be more affordable for shoppers.\n\nThe company’s latest glasses, the Air 3s, are another evolutionary upgrade that offer improved performance and vastly superior audio over prior generations while retaining the same affordability that has always been a draw for RayNeo.\n\nDesign of the RayNeo Air 3s AR Glasses\n\nTODAY'S BEST DEALS $269 at Amazon\n\nSince I recently reviewed the RayNeo Air 2s , I initially thought there was a mix-up in the shipment sent to me because the Air 3s look the same from the outside. This is both good and bad – while the design is attractive, the use of cheap plastics still doesn’t impart a substantial feel to the glasses.\n\nThe Air 3s includes a shaded, single-piece front lens. Unlike the Xreal One , this opaque lens doesn’t feature electrochromic dimming. You also don’t get a separate, physical light blocker in the box, so if the default dimming isn’t enough to block ambient light from ruining your viewing experience, you’re out of luck (unless you go for a homemade or third-party solution).\n\nImage 1 of 7 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nYou’ll also notice the familiar silver-colored, three-position arms sprouting from the primary frame. The left arm contains a volume rocker and a menu button, while the right arm has a brightness rocker and a USB-C port at the end for the included USB-C to USB-C cable. I will mention that RayNeo no longer sticks the ugly FCC label on the outside of the right arm.\n\nThe Air 3s continues to use Sony Micro-LED panels, as do most consumer AR glasses. However, RayNeo has made some tweaks thanks to the inclusion of its HueView screen technology, which aims to provide a richer palette of colors. As a result, the Air 3s comply with the IMAX Enhanced standard, covering 98 percent of DCI-P3 and 145 percent of sRGB and delivering a native contrast ratio of 200,000:1 (up from 100,000:1 on the Air 2s). Maximum brightness has also improved slightly, increasing from 600 nits to 650 nits.\n\nLong-term wearing of AR glasses can cause fatigue (as I experienced acutely with the Air 2s), so RayNeo has implemented its 3,840 Hz DC+PWM “OptiCare” dimming system. OptiCare regulates color output and minimizes flickering that could cause eye discomfort.\n\nRayNeo also turned their attention to the audio subsystem, which was a sore point during my time with the Airs 2s. This time, the company uses an in-house designed and turned four-speaker setup with a claimed 200 percent boost in acoustic performance.\n\nThe box includes two nose pads, one of which is already installed. RayNeo also provides a sample frame for prescription lenses, a carrying case, and a cleaning cloth. The company continues to include a hard carrying case, although it has received a slight redesign compared to the version included in the Air 2s. It has enough room for the glasses, the USB-C cable, and the cleaning cloth.\n\nSpecifications for the RayNeo Air 3s\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Display 1920 x 1080 per eye Display Type OLED Brightness 650 nits Field of View 47 degrees Degrees of Freedom 3 DoF Audio Dual open-air speakers Connectivity USB-C Weight 2.68 ounces (76 grams)\n\nUsing the RayNeo Air 3s\n\nThe Air 3s connects to supported devices (which support video-out over USB-C) with the included braided USB-C cable. The USB-C end that plugs into the right arm of the Air 3s has a slight downward bend, which prevents the cable from sticking straight out behind you.\n\nThere is broad support for most smartphones, tablets, PCs, and Macs on the market. I had no trouble using the Air 3s with a MacBook Pro (M3 Pro), Mac Mini (M4), iPhone 16 Pro, iPad Pro (M4), Lenovo Legion Go , and a Legion Go S . I attempted to use the glasses with the Asus ZenFone 10, but it was a no-go since the Android smartphone doesn’t support video-out via its USB-C port.\n\nThe Air 3s simulates a 201-inch virtual display projected six meters in front of your face and has a 47-degree field of view (FoV), slightly up from 46 degrees on the Air 2s. However, the most significant change I noticed with the Air 3s was that I didn’t experience the edge blurriness that marred my experience with the Air 2s.\n\nThe Air 2s were crisp towards the center of my field of vision, but became blurrier towards the periphery. This mismatch caused severe fatigue as my eyes attempted to lock on to on-screen text. I had no issues with the Air 3s, even after spending multiple hours using the glasses to write and edit articles.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nAs was the case with the Air 2s, I was able to thoroughly enjoy movies on the Air 3s. While it’s perfectly feasible to use the glasses for productivity tasks in Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia 15.4, I feel they are more at home when used purely as a media consumption accessory.\n\nFor example, I enjoyed playing Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Forza Horizon 5 using the Air 3s with the Legion Go S. The former game was incredibly immersive with the “big screen” experience – playing it at night, with all the lights off in a room with nighttime also set in the game’s time settings is a transformative experience.\n\nI also enjoyed just lounging around and watching movies on the Air 3s. I watched Inception and Oppenheimer with the glasses, and even managed to watch a good portion of one of my childhood favorite movies: Innerspace.\n\nThe enjoyable media watching experience was enhanced by another significant upgrade over the Air 2s: the audio system. I harped on the mediocre speaker system on the Air 2s, which sounded horrible and had issues with distortion. More problematic was the incessant buzzing and rattling that I experienced. The Air 3s exhibits none of those ailments and actually has performance more closely aligned with the Xreal One Series.\n\nI still would have liked a tad more bass, but there’s not much else to complain about with the sound quality. RayNeo even includes a Whisper Mode 2.0, which cuts down on sound leakage from the speakers when playing multimedia content while wearing the Air 3s in public.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe previous generation RayNeo Air 2s was a big disappointment; however, the Air 3s have improved upon its predecessor in two significant ways: the speaker system and the optics. It’s like night and day comparing the audio performance of the Air 3s with its predecessor. Audio sounds more precise, and there’s none of the plastic buzzing that plagued the Air 2s. The blurriness I experienced around the edges of the viewing area on the Air 2s has also been addressed with the Air 3s.\n\nEven better, the improvements don’t come with a price hike compared to its predecessor. The Air 2s are currently available for $299 from Amazon , while the Air 3s will go on sale priced at $269, according to RayNeo. That’s a screaming bargain in the AR glasses realm, and makes the Air 3s a must-buy if you’re in the market."}

With its striking two-tone design, upgraded cameras, and a powerful new chip, the device aims to redefine the premium smartphone experience. However, its bold design choices and premium price tag may provoke mixed reactions among users, sparking debates about its appeal and practicality. The video below from Unbox Therapy gives us a look at the design of this year’s flagship iPhone.\n\nDesign: Aesthetic Evolution or Risky Departure?\n\nApple has introduced a bold new design with the iPhone 17 Pro Max, featuring a distinctive two-tone back that reduces the glass area. This fresh aesthetic is paired with an aluminum frame, a departure from the titanium used in previous models. The aluminum frame not only makes the device lighter but also contributes to its durability and comfort during extended use.

Use these free tools instead", "fullContent": "Microsoft mainly supplies Windows in two different editions: Home and Professional.\n\nWindows 11 Home is pre-installed on many PCs, while the Pro edition is often installed on business devices. This is because Windows 11 Pro can be integrated into a company’s network infrastructure (Active Directory), whereas the Home edition cannot.\n\nHowever, this feature is not necessary for private users who are unlikely to operate a Windows server in their home network.\n\nNevertheless, the Windows Pro edition has some features that are of interest to everyone.\n\nIf you want to take advantage of this, you can perform a Pro update for a fee. For details, see the box “Upgrade from Windows 11 Home to Pro.”\n\nHome or Pro? Users of the Home edition receive most of the additional Pro functions free of charge. Additional tools provide what is missing in the cheaper Windows edition. IDG\n\nBut an upgrade from Windows Home can also be completely free: Almost all Pro functions can be replaced by free software.\n\nIt is even possible to unlock two Pro functions in the Home Edition, which we describe in more detail in this article.\n\nThe differences between Windows Home and Pro\n\nThere are actually only a few points where the two editions differ. Here are the most important and relevant for private users:\n\nBitlocker encryption , which can be used to secure the entire drive or USB sticks, is reserved for the Pro edition. Bitlocker is particularly useful for laptops so that nobody can access your data if the device is lost. However, Microsoft has added a similar function to the Home edition of Windows 11 24H2 with device encryption (point 3). This requires you to log in with a Microsoft account. Users who do not want a Microsoft account or use Windows 10 can use alternative methods (points 4 and 5).\n\n, which can be used to secure the entire drive or USB sticks, is reserved for the Pro edition.

Users who do not want a Microsoft account or use Windows 10 can use alternative methods (points 4 and 5). Hyper-V is software that can be used to virtualize operating systems. For example, you can install Linux or Windows in Hyper-V while Windows is running and use it as a virtual second system. We describe how Hyper-V can be activated in the Home edition and what the alternative Virtualbox offers in points 6 and 7.\n\nis software that can be used to virtualize operating systems. For example, you can install Linux or Windows in Hyper-V while Windows is running and use it as a virtual second system. We describe how Hyper-V can be activated in the Home edition and what the alternative Virtualbox offers in points 6 and 7. The remote desktop enables remote access to the desktop of another Windows computer via the network. The Home edition only offers remote support, where a user must first invite a helper before they can access the other PC. Both methods are only suitable to a limited extent for spontaneous help via the internet. Remote access only works if the necessary ports are open in the router firewall. This is not necessary for other remote assistance programs (see point 8).\n\nenables remote access to the desktop of another Windows computer via the network. The Home edition only offers remote support, where a user must first invite a helper before they can access the other PC. Both methods are only suitable to a limited extent for spontaneous help via the internet. Remote access only works if the necessary ports are open in the router firewall. This is not necessary for other remote assistance programs (see point 8). Group policies offer centralized management of user rights. They are mainly used in larger company networks in which functions can be restricted or specified on all PCs via the central server. Local group policies are a variant for computers that do not belong to a Windows domain. The editor for this can be activated in the Home edition, or an alternative tool can be used (see box “Configuring Windows with group policies”).\n\nEncryption with Windows on-board resources\n\nWith the Home edition of Windows 10 and 11, you cannot encrypt drives with Bitlocker. However, it is possible to integrate encrypted external hard drives or USB sticks into the file system. Encryption must be carried out on another PC on which the Pro or Enterprise edition is installed.\n\nIf no other computer is available, use a virtual PC (point 6 or 7).\n\nSecurity for external drives: Encrypt the drive with Bitlocker under Windows Pro. Although the Home Edition cannot create it, it can still integrate it into the file system.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nGo to “Settings” (Win-I), search for Bitlocker and click on “Manage Bitlocker.” Click on the desired drive and then on “Activate Bitlocker.”\n\nTick the box “Use password to unlock the drive” and enter a sufficiently secure password. After clicking on “Next,” save the recovery key in a file, for example. Follow the further instructions of the wizard.\n\nA drive encrypted in this way can also be used with the Home edition. If you open it in the file manager by double-clicking on it, Windows will ask you for the password.\n\nDevice encryption of Windows 11 24H2\n\nMicrosoft has equipped Windows 11 24H2 Home with a new function that can be used to encrypt the system drive. Bitlocker provides the basis, albeit with fewer options than the Pro edition. Windows login with a Microsoft account is also required.\n\nIn Windows 11 24H2 Home: Activate “Device encryption” in the “Settings” if you want Windows to encrypt the system partition. A Microsoft account is required for this. Chris Hoffman / IDG\n\nIf you are using version 24H2, you should check the option in the “Settings” under “Privacy and security > Device encryption.”\n\nIf “Device encryption” is not displayed, the system requirements for Windows 11 are probably not met. Then check in the firmware settings of the PC whether TPM and Secure Boot are activated.\n\nIf you activate device encryption, you should save the associated recovery key. You can determine the key via account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey after logging in with your Microsoft account.\n\nThe recovery key is required so that you can access your data via a rescue or secondary system in the event of Windows or hardware problems.\n\nSee also: How to make Microsoft Windows services work for you\n\nEncrypt drives with Veracrypt\n\nIf you don’t want to or can’t use Bitlocker or device encryption, Veracrypt is an almost equivalent alternative. The tool also has the advantage that it is available for Linux and Mac OS. You can also use it to integrate encrypted Windows drives under these systems.\n\nIn terms of security, it is difficult to compare Bitlocker and Veracrypt. With the open source tool Veracrypt, you can examine the source code and check the code quality and implementation of the algorithms. This is not possible with Bitlocker.\n\nNeither method can promise 100 percent security — ultimately, the use of any software is a question of trust.\n\nA study conducted by the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT) in 2020 is entitled “VeraCrypt with minor flaws.” No serious vulnerabilities were found.\n\nVeracrypt is not as well integrated into the system as Bitlocker. It is somewhat cumbersome to use and you have to enter the password for decryption every time you restart Windows. For security reasons, the password should be more than 20 characters long and sufficiently complex.\n\nIf this is too much effort for you, you should consider whether you really need to encrypt the entire hard drive. Perhaps the solution presented in point 5 will suffice. Please also note that Veracrypt only requests the password on a restart. When reactivating after “Sleep,” only the Windows password is requested by default.\n\nIf you want to encrypt the system partition, proceed as follows:\n\nStep 1: The use of Veracrypt is considered secure. Nevertheless, it is advisable to create a complete backup of the Windows partition or at least the personal files.\n\nIf, for example, the power fails during encryption, the files on the hard drive will no longer be readable. Also have a USB stick ready that is formatted with the FAT32 file system.\n\nAbout 5MB of free space is sufficient and you can also use the stick for other purposes.\n\nIn Veracrypt you will have to create a sufficiently long password for an encrypted drive to be used every time you restart your computer. Veracrypt\n\nStep 2: In Veracrypt, go to “System > Encrypt system partition/system drive.” Follow the easy-to-understand instructions of the wizard. You can accept the defaults almost everywhere.\n\nWhen entering the password, please note that the Veracrypt bootloader works with the U.S. keyboard layout. The program takes this into account and switches the keyboard layout when entering the password. Tick the “Show password” box to see the actual password.\n\nStep 3: The wizard prompts you to create a rescue data carrier. By default, Veracrypt saves the required file under the name “VeraCrypt Rescue Disk.zip” in your “Documents” folder.\n\nUnzip the file and copy the “EFI” folder it contains to your FAT32-formatted USB stick. After clicking on “Next,” the wizard will check whether the folder is present.\n\nStep 4: In the “System encryption pre-test” step, click on “Test.” Read the description, which is best printed out. Click on “Yes” when you are prompted to restart the PC. Type in the password and confirm with the Enter key.\n\nIf Veracrypt does not accept the password, for example if it is entered incorrectly, press the Esc key. Windows will then start as usual from the previously unencrypted hard drive and you will have to configure the encryption again.\n\nOtherwise, Windows will start after you enter the password. After Windows logon, the “Pre-test completed” window appears automatically, in which you click on “Encrypt.” Veracrypt then starts the encryption process, which may take some time. A window will inform you of the progress.\n\nStep 5: Try booting from the rescue drive. You may need to change the boot sequence in the firmware setup. The rescue system offers a simple menu that can be used to repair the Veracrypt boot loader, load an alternative boot loader, or decrypt the system partition.\n\nUpgrade from Windows 11 Home to Pro The Home edition can be converted to a Pro edition without reinstallation. All you need is a new product key. Microsoft currently charges $99 for the upgrade in the official store. In the PCWorld shop, however, you can get the official upgrade for just $59. If you have purchased a Pro key, go to “System” in the “Settings” under Windows 11, click on “Activation” and then on “Update Windows Edition.” Click on “Change” after “Change product key” and enter the new product key. Foundry\n\nEncrypted container with Veracrypt\n\nIf you encrypt your Windows partition, you no longer have to worry about the security of individual files. On the other hand, it is not particularly convenient to have to enter a long and complicated password when restarting the system.\n\nFor more security, only encrypt the files that are really worth protecting. To do this, use Veracrypt to create an encrypted container file that holds the sensitive files.\n\nSecure container: Create an encrypted container file with Veracrypt. Store sensitive and important documents in it. The file can be stored on any drive. Veracrypt\n\nStep 1: In Veracrypt, go to “Volume > Create new volume.” Leave the first option “Create encrypted container file” and click on “Next” and again on “Next.”\n\nStep 2: Specify the storage location and file name after clicking on “File.” Follow the further instructions of the wizard.\n\nStep 3: In the “Volume password” window, enter a sufficiently complex password with 20 characters or more. If you tick the “Show password” box, you can check the entry.\n\nStep 4 (optional): You can also use a short password or a PIN if you also create a key file. To do this, tick the box next to “Use key file” and then click on “Key files.”\n\nClick on “Create key file(s)” and generate the entropy by moving the mouse. Enter a name for the key file, click on the “Create and save key file(s)” button and select the storage location.\n\nSave the file to a USB stick. The container cannot be unlocked without the stick or the key file in combination with the password.\n\nClose the window, click on “Add files,” select the key file you have just created, and click on “OK.” Continue with the wizard.\n\nStep 5: In the Veracrypt main window, click on a free drive letter, go to “Volume > Select file” and specify the file created in Step 2. Then click on “Volume > Mount volume” and enter the password.\n\nIf you created a key file in step 4, tick “Use key file,” click on “Key files,” and specify the file via “Add files.”\n\nStep 6: For faster access to the encrypted container, right-click on the (virtual) drive in the Veracrypt main window and select “Add to favorites” in the context menu.\n\nTick the box “Mount selected volume at login” and confirm with “OK.” Veracrypt then automatically opens a window for entering the password after the Windows logon.\n\nIf you are using a key file, you should specify this via “Settings > Default key files.” Otherwise, you will have to select the file each time in the password entry window. You can specify the same key file when creating further data containers.\n\nVirtual second PC with Virtualbox\n\nVirtualbox is open source software and therefore available free of charge for all Windows editions. The range of functions corresponds roughly to Microsoft’s Hyper-V. Install Virtualbox and the Virtualbox extension package, which is required for some functions, such as remote access and encryption of virtual hard disks.\n\nClick on the “New” button to start a wizard for setting up a virtual machine in Virtualbox. You enter the ISO image with the installation system and specify the operating system and the size of the RAM and virtual hard drive.\n\nAfter completing the wizard, click on “Start” and install the operating system as usual.\n\nConfigure VMs with Virtualbox: A wizard supports you with the installation of the system. You will need the ISO file of the Linux or Windows installation system, for example. Oracle\n\nIn the virtual machine window, go to “Devices > Insert guest extensions” and install the guest extensions from the virtual DVD drive. The optimized drivers ensure better graphics performance, for example.\n\nRemote access or remote maintenance via the network\n\nRemotely control another PC: The free Rustdesk enables access to a remote desktop. This works in the local network and also over the Internet without further configuration. Rustdesk\n\nYou do not have to rely on the remote desktop connection of the Pro edition for remote access. There is plenty of software for this task. For example, the open source solution Rustdesk is free of charge.\n\nThe program does not require a firewall configuration. The connection is established in encrypted form via the provider’s switching server.\n\nThe program works without installation — the people involved only need to start it. The person seeking help tells you the ID and password displayed. You then establish the connection, which the person on the other PC must confirm.\n\nActions that require increased rights must also be confirmed. For convenient use, however, you should install Rustdesk using the button at the bottom left of the window. This also enables unattended access to a computer. You must set a password for this in the settings under “Security.”"}

But is the advice from the controversial financial educator and his team right?\n\nRead Next: Robert Kiyosaki Is Dumping Gold and Silver: Here’s What He’s Buying Instead\n\nLearn More: Here's the Minimum Salary Required To Be Considered Upper Class in 2025\n\nGOBankingRates talked to experts to get the inside scoop on what investment moves and retirement savings plan are right for you.\n\nKiyosaki’s Case Against the 401(k)\n\nThe Rich Dad’s argument centers on several key points. First, it challenges the conventional wisdom about employer matches. “If it weren’t for 401(k)s, your employer would have to pay you that money as part of your salary,” Kiyosaki said. In other words, according to Kiyosaki, what many consider “free money” is actually compensation that would otherwise be paid directly to employees.\n\nThe Rich Dad article also took aim at the fees associated with traditional retirement accounts. “A typical 401(k) plan takes 80 percent of the profits,” it explained, leaving investors with just 20% of their potential returns.\n\nAdditionally, the article points to tax disadvantages, noting that while 401(k) gains are taxed as ordinary income (up to 35%), real estate investors can benefit from more favorable tax treatment.\n\nThe article also emphasized the lack of control that can come with traditional retirement accounts, unlike real estate, where you can directly influence returns.\n\nFind Out: How To Protect Your 401(k) From a Stock Market Crash\n\nThe Case for Multifamily Real Estate\n\nInstead of relying on a 401(k), the Rich Dad article promoted multifamily real estate investing as a superior alternative. Here is some of the reasoning.\n\nLeverage: This involves using other people’s money to purchase a valuable asset.\n\nAppreciation: This is the ability to increase property value through effective management.\n\nControl: With real estate, you can have direct influence over income and expenses, unlike market-dependent investments.\n\nTax Advantages: There are significant tax benefits with real estate, including depreciation deductions and capital gains deferrals.\n\n“For many investors, it’s short-sided to find only one building and make managing it your job,” the article noted. “Instead, become an investor and find more great deals that you can purchase and have professionally managed.”"}

The strong quarterly share price increase of 40% contrasts with the company's decline in net income and earnings per share for 2024. However, the declared dividend and active share buyback program have reinforced investor confidence. These moves, combined with confirmed production guidance, suggest a strategy focused on shareholder value, potentially bolstering future revenue and earnings forecasts.\n\nOver a five-year period, Agnico Eagle Mines has delivered a total shareholder return of 148.21%, highlighting robust long-term performance. This surpasses the broader US market return of 3.6% over the past year. Despite the one-year challenges, such as a 2.9% drop in production guidance, Agnico Eagle's commitment to expansion projects like Hope Bay and Malartic could sustain revenue growth, though rising costs remain a concern.\n\nWhile the stock's current price of US$100.13 remains below the consensus price target of US$114.69, indicating a potential upside of 12.7%, it reflects cautious investor sentiment amid varying analyst earnings projections. The consensus anticipates earnings reaching US$2.4 billion by April 2028, contingent on the company maintaining a Price-to-Earnings ratio of 30.0x. As such, the news from the introduction supports a cautiously optimistic outlook, balanced against revenue risks and cost escalation concerns.\n\nAccording our valuation report, there's an indication that Agnico Eagle Mines' share price might be on the expensive side.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

(TSE:NOA) shareholders may wish to note that the Independent Chairman of the Board, Martin Ferron, recently bought CA$444k worth of stock, paying CA$22.19 for each share. However, it only increased shareholding by a small percentage, and it wasn't a huge purchase by absolute value, either.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nNorth American Construction Group Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn fact, the recent purchase by Independent Chairman of the Board Martin Ferron was not their only trade of North American Construction Group shares this year. Earlier in the year, they sold shares at a price ofCA$30.75 per share in a -CA$610k transaction. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (CA$19.87). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.\n\nHappily, we note that in the last year insiders paid CA$3.1m for 127.65k shares. But insiders sold 31.21k shares worth CA$961k. In total, North American Construction Group insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nSee our latest analysis for North American Construction Group\n\nTSX:NOA Insider Trading Volume April 12th 2025\n\nThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. If investing in lesser known companies is your style, you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nDoes North American Construction Group Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 11% of North American Construction Group shares, worth about CA$62m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At North American Construction Group Tell Us?\n\nIt is good to see recent purchasing. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of North American Construction Group we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Be aware that North American Construction Group is showing 4 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those can't be ignored..."}

It is recommended that all users upgrade to this version for improved reliability. rpki-client is a FREE, easy-to-use implementation of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure ( RPKI ) for Relying Parties to facilitate validation of BGP announcements. The program queries the global RPKI repository system and validates untrusted network inputs. The program outputs validated ROA payloads, BGPsec Router keys, and ASPA payloads in configuration formats suitable for OpenBGPD and BIRD, and supports emitting CSV and JSON for consumption by other routing stacks. See RFC 6480 and RFC 6811 for a description of how RPKI and BGP Prefix Origin Validation help secure the global Internet routing system. rpki-client was primarily developed by Kristaps Dzonsons, Claudio Jeker, Job Snijders, Theo Buehler, Theo de Raadt and Sebastian Benoit as part of the OpenBSD Project. This release includes the following changes to the previous release: - rpki-client now includes arin.tal which is no longer legally encumbered. See https://www.arin.net/announcements/20250116-tal/ - rpki-client reports Certification Authorities that do not meaningfully participate in the RPKI as non-functional CAs . By definition, a CA is non-functional if there is no currently valid Manifest. The number of such CAs is printed at the end of each run and more detailed information is available in the JSON (-j) and ometrics (-m) output. - OpenBSD reliability errata 014: Incorrect internal RRDP state handling in rpki-client can lead to a denial of service. Affected are rpki-client versions 7.5 - 9.4. - Termination of rsync child processes with SIGTERM is no longer treated as an error if rpki-client has sent this signal. This only affects openrsync. - Do not exit filemode with an error if a .gbr or a .tak object contains control characters in its UTF -8 strings. Instead, only warn and emit a sanitized version in JSON output. Upcoming breaking change: - Starting with release 9.6, rpki-client will emit all key identifiers ( AKI and SKI ) encoded in JSON as bare hex strings without colons."}

With a comprehensive redesign, enhanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, and smarter features, it aims to redefine how you interact with your iPhone. However, these advancements come with a notable trade-off: older devices will no longer be supported. Below is an in-depth look at the key updates and their implications for you in a new video from iReviews.\n\nDevice Compatibility: A Focus on Newer Models\n\nApple is prioritizing newer hardware with iOS 19, marking a significant shift in device compatibility. Older models such as the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR will no longer receive updates. Supported devices will include the iPhone 11 series, SE2, SE3, and all subsequent models.

By modernizing the operating system’s visual elements, Apple aims to enhance both functionality and user satisfaction. This update not only refreshes the iPhone’s appearance but also aligns it with contemporary design trends, making sure a seamless and visually appealing experience.\n\nFloating Bar: A Smarter Way to Navigate\n\nNavigation on iOS 19 takes a significant leap forward with the introduction of a floating bar. Unlike the traditional static navigation bar, the floating bar offers a dynamic and layered interface that adapts to your usage. This feature is designed to make multitasking more efficient, allowing you to switch between apps and tasks with ease.\n\nThe floating bar enhances productivity by providing quick access to frequently used functions and apps. Its intuitive design ensures that navigation feels natural and fluid, reducing the time spent searching for tools or features. Whether you’re managing multiple tasks or simply browsing, this update simplifies the way you interact with your device, making everyday actions more seamless.\n\nSmarter Battery Management\n\nBattery management receives a significant upgrade in iOS 19, with new features aimed at improving transparency and efficiency. Real-time charging status and estimated charging time will now be displayed directly on the lock screen, giving you immediate access to critical information about your device’s power. These updates help you monitor your battery more effectively, making sure that you can avoid overcharging and extend the lifespan of your device.\n\nIn addition to these features, iOS 19 introduces smarter algorithms for battery optimization. By analyzing usage patterns and adjusting power consumption accordingly, the operating system ensures that your device remains efficient throughout the day. This focus on battery intelligence reflects Apple’s commitment to enhancing the practical aspects of device management, making it easier for you to stay connected without interruptions.\n\nSiri 2.0: A More Context-Aware Assistant\n\nSiri undergoes a fantastic upgrade with the release of Siri 2.0, making it a more context-aware and proactive assistant.

For example, Siri can provide relevant suggestions based on the app you’re using or the task you’re performing, streamlining your workflow and saving time.\n\nAdditionally, Siri 2.0 integrates more deeply with both native and third-party apps. This enhanced functionality allows Siri to perform tasks within Notes, Messages, and other applications, expanding its utility across various aspects of your device. These updates make Siri a more versatile and intelligent assistant, capable of anticipating your needs and delivering a personalized experience.\n\nAI Integration Across Core Apps\n\nArtificial intelligence plays a central role in iOS 19, with expanded functionality across core apps such as Safari, Mail, Photos, and Messages. In Photos, AI enhancements improve search accuracy, making it easier to locate specific images or albums. In Mail, smarter categorization tools help you organize your inbox more efficiently, reducing clutter and improving productivity.\n\nThese AI-driven updates are designed to simplify everyday tasks, allowing you to focus on what matters most. By using machine learning and advanced algorithms, Apple is creating a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. The integration of AI across multiple apps highlights the company’s commitment to innovation, making sure that iOS 19 remains at the forefront of technological advancements.\n\nBeta Testing Timeline\n\nThe rollout of iOS 19 will begin with a developer beta on June 9, 2025, coinciding with Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). A public beta is expected to follow by mid-July 2025, providing an early opportunity for users to explore the new features and offer feedback. This phased approach allows Apple to refine the operating system based on user input, making sure a polished and reliable final release.\n\nWhat iOS 19 Means for You\n\niOS 19 represents a significant evolution in Apple’s operating system, combining a bold redesign with advanced features and smarter functionality. From the revamped user interface to the introduction of the floating bar and enhanced AI integration, this update is tailored to meet the demands of modern users. While the decision to drop support for older devices may require some users to upgrade, the innovations in iOS 19 set a new standard for what an operating system can achieve. With the beta release just around the corner, you’ll soon have the chance to experience these exciting changes firsthand.\n\nUncover more insights about iOS 19 redesign in previous articles we have written.\n\nSource & Image Credit: iReviews\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

More than 92% pass on the first try.\n\nBut if you were to ask these same questions of President Donald Trump and his top advisers, I’m not sure if their answers would be accepted by a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services officer.\n\nLet’s compare public statements from Trump and his allies with history and civics facts provided for test-takers by the U.S. government. Keep in mind that “passing” this portion of the test means merely getting six out of 10 questions correct.\n\nWhat is the supreme law of the land?\n\nCorrect answer: the Constitution.\n\nWhile speaking at a White House event for the National Governors Association in February, Trump asked Maine Gov. Janet Mills if she intended to follow his executive order on transgender athletes. She said her state would comply with state and federal laws. Trump responded, “We are the federal law.” It’s hard say exactly what Trump meant. Is he personally the law? Or the executive branch? Or the federal government? But any interpretation is hard to square with either the separation of powers or federalism, especially since Trump was referring to an executive order.\n\nWhat is the rule of law?\n\nCorrect answer: No one is above the law.\n\nIn January, Trump posted a supposed quote from French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte on his Truth Social and X accounts, then reposted it from the White House X account and pinned it to the top of his feed. A day later, he reposted a variation of it with a portrait of Napoleon. The quote: “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.”\n\nTrump adviser Elon Musk, meanwhile, has been known to claim, “The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics. Everything else is a recommendation.”\n\nWhat stops one branch of government from becoming too powerful?\n\nCorrect answers: Checks and balances, or the separation of powers.\n\nIn a May 2024 podcast on President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness, now-Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino openly laughed at the idea of checks and balances. “That’s really funny,” he told his listeners, arguing that “the only thing that matters” is power.\n\nIn response to an order from a judge barring the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive Treasury Department data, Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.” Around the same time, Trump said at a news briefing, “It seems hard to believe that a judge could say, ‘We don’t want you to do that,’ so maybe we have to look at the judges because I think that’s a very serious violation.”\n\nMusk has gone even further, calling for the firing of federal judges, who serve lifetime appointments under the Constitution. “This evil judge must be fired!” he posted on X in February, in an apparent reference to Judge John Bates. (Bates has ruled against the Trump administration in recent months and presided over multiple Jan. 6 riot cases.)\n\nUnder our Constitution, some powers belong to the states. What is one power of the states?\n\nCorrect answers: Provide schooling, provide police and fire departments, issue driver’s licenses, approve zoning and land use.\n\nSpeaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee in April, Trump called for a federal bill on elections, which are run by the states under the elections clause of the Constitution. “The states are just an agent of the federal government,” he said. To be fair, Trump is correct that Congress has some power over elections, but his description of states as agents of the federal government does not jibe with the general principles of federalism.\n\nWhat are two rights of everyone living in the United States?\n\nCorrect answers: Freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to petition the government, freedom of religion and the right to bear arms.\n\nTrump has argued that he “brought back free speech in America,” but critics have questioned his administration’s actions. Speaking to reporters during a trip to Ireland in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended his decision to revoke the visas of foreign students at U.S. universities who protested the war in Gaza. “This is not about free speech,” he said. “This is about people that don’t have a right to be in the United States to begin with. No one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card.” However, as the citizenship test notes in the question itself, the First Amendment applies to everyone living in the United States, not just U.S. citizens.\n\nThese are not the only examples of problematic statements from Trump and his advisers on the basics of American democracy, but they are five that are most directly addressed by the citizenship test.\n\nTrump has also posted on Truth Social an image of himself wearing a crown with the phrase “LONG LIVE THE KING!” over a dispute on congestion pricing in New York City.\n\nHe’s also mangled the number of articles in the Constitution (it’s seven), telling House Republicans, “I’m for Article I, I’m for Article II, I’m for Article XII.” And in a Truth Social post in 2022 that made false claims of election fraud, he called for the “termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution.”\n\nWhile those basic factual inaccuracies are unlikely to come up during a citizenship test, they certainly would raise eyebrows if you volunteered them at a naturalization hearing."}

Bigme is poised to release its first color e-paper dedicated monitor. To date, it has only issued an all-in-one PC with a super expensive price tag. It will employ Kaleido 3 and use its super refresh system to eliminate ghosting and ensure customers can be productive while using something that is easy on the eyes for long sessions.\n\nThe upcoming 13.3-inch Bigme monitor is the company’s first external screen to display colors. The pixel density for color content is 150 PPI, which would indicate a resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels at an aspect ratio of 4:3. The refresh rate of 30Hz might sound slow compared to modern OLED or LCD monitors, but for a color e-ink panel it’s rather smooth\n\nThe full specs are unknown since they have not officially announced it yet, but they are teasing the release on Reddit. However, it should have USB-C, HDMI, and hopefully a Displayport. It will also be compatible with both macOS and Windows. The price is unknown, but hopefully, we won’t have to wait that long.\n\nMichael Kozlowski Michael Kozlowski is the editor-in-chief at Good e-Reader and has written about audiobooks and e-readers for the past fifteen years.

Located on the coast of Ishikari Bay, Otaru is famous for its preserved canal district, illuminated by streetlights after sundown, and roads that rise steeply from the shoreline making for dramatic wide views of the city and sea, especially from the vantage point near the top of the slope known as Funamizaka (“Ship-viewing Hill”).\n\nHowever, being a picturesque place means lots of people coming to take pictures, and Otaru, like many of Japan’s most popular tourism destinations, is struggling with issues related to overtourism from foreign travelers who, inadvertently or not, aren’t following Japanese etiquette norms. As shown in the news report below, tourists have been standing in the middle of public roads to line up their photos just as they like them, and there have also been incidents of tourists encroaching on private property to snap pictures or create their own shortcuts from Point A to Point B.\n\nSo to address the problem, Otaru has decided to dispatch ninja.\n\nMercifully, the ninja won’t be incapacitating offenders with shuriken, blowgun darts, or other shinobi weaponry. Instead, Otaru Next 100, a local community outreach organization made up primarily of local residents in their 20s, is creating a series of multilingual poster-style awareness graphics in an effort to adjust tourist behavior in a way that’s informative and direct while still being playful and non-aggressive. “I think it’s simply a matter of [foreign tourists] not knowing the rules, and not that they’re intentionally choosing to break them,” said Otaru Next 100 member Noriaki Ikeda. “What we need is to have them enjoy sightseeing while understanding [what is and isn’t OK].”\n\nSo far three posters have been produced, cautioning tourists to keep out of private property, not walk in the middle of the road, and especially not to stand in the middle of the road and pose for pictures.\n\nSure, the English translations could be better. “Local people are in trouble,” for example, sounds more like locals themselves have been caught doing something wrong, when what the poster is really trying to say is that local people are troubled by tourists’ behavior. Still, it’s clear what each poster is saying to not do, and the way they all cordially start with “Thank you for coming” and include the hope that visitors will “enjoy Otaru” communicates that the ninja/city have no beef with foreign tourists themselves, and that it’s only the demonstrated dangerous/inconsiderate actions that they want to stop.\n\nThere are at least seven more ninja manners posters planned, and they’ll be shown through the Otaru Next 100 official Twitter account as they’re completed.\n\nSource: Otaru Next 100, FNN Prime Online, NHK News Web\n\nTop image: Pakutaso\n\nInsert images: Otaru Next 100\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

Some of it we knew was going to happen — he campaigned on it. But then there are things that never came up in the campaign that are now happening. Some are cruel and almost all are pointless things that make you wonder: Who voted for this?\n\nLike, who voted against National History Day? More than half a million students work to qualify for the national history competition each year. It is awesome and adorable. Students select a topic within the constraints of the theme and the time period. They can make an exhibit, do a performance, write a paper or make a website or documentary.\n\nIf a candidate in November’s election had run on the promise to destroy a history contest for children, would that have affected anyone’s decision?\n\nIt’s the most amazing, all-American thing I can imagine. If you look at local news over the past few weeks, you will see articles about students in places like Iowa, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Ohio and Missouri proudly qualifying for their regional competition. Once they clear that, they go on to the national competition, which was set to start in just nine weeks.\n\nBut last week, Trump and Elon Musk killed its funding. Why? Does slashing funds for a children’s history competition really help with “government efficiency”?\n\nAfter the Trump administration gutted the budget, Cathy Gorn, the executive director of National History Day, posted on social media to ask folks to donate so the kids can make it to the national competition in June.\n\n“This means the loss of more than $336,000 over this year and next,” Gorn said in a video posted to Instagram. “[P]art of that funding was to support the national contest, so now we need your help. We need to raise in the next few months about $132,000 to make history day happen in June.”\n\n$132,000 is all that is standing between these kids and the national awards. If Trump skipped some of his golf weekends down in Florida, the savings could fund National History Day for decades.\n\nAll of this makes me wonder: If a candidate in November’s election had run on the promise to destroy a history contest for children, would that have affected anyone’s decision?\n\nSeriously, who voted for this?"}

We’re all in this crazy world together, and we all get weary at times. Be recklessly gracious!\n\nThe wisest, most loving, and well-rounded people you have ever met are likely those who have been shattered in some way. Yes, life often creates the greatest humans by breaking them first. It’s the painstaking journey of falling apart and coming back together that fills their hearts and minds with a level of compassion, understanding, and deep-loving wisdom that can’t possibly be acquired any other way.\n\nAngel and I have worked with hundreds of these incredible people over the past 16 years, both online and offline, through various forms of coaching and live events. In many cases they came to us feeling stuck and lost, unaware of their own brilliance, blind to the fact that their struggles have strengthened them and given them a resilient upper hand in this crazy world. Honestly, many of these people are now our biggest heroes. Over the years they have given us as much, if not more, than we have given them. And they continue to be some of our greatest sources of inspiration.\n\nSo today, to honor these unlikely heroes of ours, we want to share a selection of their stories with you (with full permission, of course). Below you will find tiny excerpts from 20 different emails we’ve received over the years — they are super short but incredibly powerful accounts of real life, real struggle, and the human resilience required to take the next step. There’s definitely something here for all of us to think about and reflect on:\n\n1. Happier Now\n\n“It’s been exactly ten years since my controlling, abusive ex-fiancé sold my favorite guitar which cost almost $2,000 and took me ages to save for. He sold it on the day I broke up with him. When I went to pick up my belongings, he was proud that he had sold it to a local pawnshop. Luckily, I managed to track down the guy who bought it from the pawnshop. The guy was really sweet and gave it back to me for free, on the condition that I join him on his front porch for an hour and play guitar with him. He grabbed a second guitar and we ended up sitting there on his porch for the rest of the afternoon playing music, talking, and laughing. He’s been my husband for almost nine years now, and we are happier now than ever.”\n\n2. Absolutely OK\n\n“The happiest moment of my life is still that split-second a year ago when, as I laid crushed under a 2000-pound car, I realized my husband and nine-year-old son were out of the vehicle and completely uninjured.”\n\n3. Second Chance\n\n“Today, on my 47th birthday, I re-read the death note I wrote on my 27th birthday about two minutes before my girlfriend showed up at my apartment and told me, ‘I’m pregnant.’ She was honestly the only reason I didn’t follow through with it. Suddenly I felt I had something to live for. Today she’s my wife and we’ve been happily married for 19 years. And my daughter, who is now a 19-year-old college student, has two younger brothers. I re-read my death note every year on my birthday as a reminder to be thankful — I’m thankful I got a second chance at life.”\n\n4. First Time\n\n“Last night just before bed, my daughter, whom I adopted three years ago at the age of seven, called me ‘mom’ for the very first time.”\n\n5. I Remember\n\n“It’s been five years since my mom — my best friend in the world — was in a car accident that resulted in her losing all of her long-term memory from before the crash. When I was little my mom and I used to quote a Winnie The Pooh book as an inside joke. One of us would ask, “Have you ever seen a dragon fly?” And the other would reply, ‘I have, I have seen a dragon fly!’ This evening I was sitting with her while we were watching TV and I randomly asked, ‘Have you ever seen a dragon fly?’ And she responded with, ‘I have, I have seen a dragon fly!’ We stared at each other for a prolonged moment, and then she jumped out of her seat and exclaimed, ‘Oh my gosh, I remember!’”\n\n6. Lucky One\n\n“I’m sitting in my hospital bed waiting to have both my breasts removed. But in a strange way I feel like the lucky one. Up until now I have had no health problems. I’m a 64-year-old woman in the last room at the end of the hall before the pediatric division of the hospital begins. Over the past few hours I have watched dozens of cancer patients being wheeled by in wheelchairs and rolling beds. None of these patients could be a day older than 17. And right now, I’m feeling like the lucky one.”\n\n7. The One\n\n“My dad is a blind cancer survivor. He lost both his eyes when he was in his early 30’s to a rare form of cancer. Despite this, he raised my sister and I, and took care of my mom who was in and out of rehab for alcoholism and depression. My mom is a fully recovered alcoholic now, my sister and I have graduated college, and my parents are still together and back to being happy. I’m certain none of this would have been possible if my dad hadn’t been such a resilient, positive force in our lives. My dad’s mental strength literally saved our family. And he’s the one who pointed me towards your blog, which he reads daily with text to speech software.”\n\n8. Perfectly Healthy\n\n“Earlier this week I went to the doctor’s office because I was experiencing awful stomach pains. They ran some tests, took blood, and told me they’d contact me in a few days. I assumed the pain was at least partially due to stress. Three weeks ago, at the age of 35, my husband, the love of my life, died from a heart attack. And this afternoon I felt another wave of despair come over me, feeling like I had nothing left. As I sat there the phone rang; it was the doctor. She said, ‘You’re perfectly healthy. You’re pregnant.’ And in that moment I cried, happy tears, for the first time three weeks. Because a couple months ago a fertility clinic discovered a condition with my husband that they said would take ‘a small miracle’ for us to get pregnant.”\n\n9. The Guidepost\n\n“I’m a war veteran. Upon arriving home 15 years ago from my final tour in Afghanistan, I found out that my wife had been cheating on me and had spent almost all of our savings. I had nowhere to stay and no phone and was suffering from it all. One of my close friends from high school, Shaun, and his wife, seeing that I was in need of help, took me in and let me live with their family of five. They helped me deal with my divorce and gave me space to get my life together. Since then I’ve moved into my own place, rediscovered my passion for life, opened a fairly successful local diner, and my friend’s kids call me Uncle Jay when they see me. The way they supported me and adopted me into their family in my desperate time of need is now the guidepost for how I try to live my life.”\n\n10. I’m Back\n\n“I’ve been dying of Leukemia since my 17th birthday. I was sent home from the hospital for my final few weeks 156 days ago. But now I’m back at the hospital being treated again, because my doctors now believe there is hope. And so do I.”\n\n11. Home Now\n\n“Today, after my daughter’s funeral, and several hours of tearful soul-searching, I started going through my phone and deleting two weeks’ worth of condolence messages. There were so many of them that I eventually selected ‘delete all,’ but one message didn’t delete. It was one of the last messages my daughter left me before she died, and it was still marked as ‘new.’ Sometimes my voicemail forces me to listen to old messages before I can delete them, so played it, even though I really didn’t want to at that moment. My daughter said, “Hey dad, I just wanted to let you know I’m okay and I’m home now.”\n\n12. Our Differences\n\n“After three years of separation, and lots of regretful drama, my ex-wife and I finally resolved our differences and we met for dinner last night. We laughed and chatted for almost five hours. Then just before we parted ways, she handed me a large envelope. In it were 20 ‘love and forgiveness’ letters she wrote me over the last three years. There was a post-it note on the envelope that read, ‘Letters I was too stubborn to send.’ And even crazier is that I wrote her a few letters too, and I still have them stored on my work computer’s desktop.”\n\n13. Simple Pleasures\n\n“Yesterday, after completing ten straight months of rehab at a live-in treatment center, I spent my first day out with my five-year-old daughter. We sat on my parent’s front porch all day making construction paper collages. The sight and sound of my daughter’s laughter and the simple pleasures of cutting construction paper and peeling Elmer’s glue off our hands are the best reminders I’ve had in ten months of why I’m choosing sobriety and life.”\n\n14. Here Praying\n\n“I was born on this day 57 years ago, but today isn’t my birthday, at least not this year. Your birthday doesn’t really come when you’re sitting in a hospital room hoping your wife of 25 years wakes up from a coma. And although the doctors are optimistic, I’m still here praying, and waiting, patiently.”\n\n15. True Blessing\n\n“Last night there was a family of six staying at the hotel where I work. They were hanging out in the lobby sharing stories, laughing, and taking turns reading excerpts from a joke book. I asked them where they were from. ‘Oh, we’re from here,’ the father said. ‘Our house literally burned down yesterday, but miraculously all of us got out safely. And that makes today a true blessing!’”\n\n16. The Sunrise\n\n“I realized that although it was the darkest period of my life, if I had not worked through and overcome those five long years of depression, I would not be here now smiling so appreciatively at the sunrise through my living room window.”\n\n17. Better Now\n\n“It took years, but when I finally found the courage to divorce him after decades of abuse, I found myself feeling alone because our closest mutual friends continued to believe his lies over my tears. But I’m finally making new friends — real friends — and feeling so much better now.”\n\n18. The Truth\n\n“I recently lost the respect of a few people I love, and the desire to hurt myself, when I finally told everyone the truth about who I really am and what I have decided to do with my life. In a nutshell, I have chosen to love and honor myself, instead of convincing others to do it for me every day.”\n\n19. Squeezed Back\n\n“At 8 A.M. this morning, after nearly four months of lifelessness in her hospital bed, we took my mom off life support. And her heart continued beating on its own. And she continued breathing on her own. Then this evening, when I squeezed her hand three times, she squeezed back three times.”\n\n20. A Promise\n\n“This afternoon, at the age of 70, I graduated from The University of North Carolina with a bachelor’s degree in business. I’ve been a successful business owner most of my life, but I decided to earn my degree to fulfill a promise I made to my mom before she lost her battle with cancer on my 20th birthday, just over 50 years ago.”\n\nFinding Growth Through Life’s Ups & Downs\n\nThe stories above obviously hold many lessons, but as mentioned earlier, one lesson I think they collectively share is that life’s challenges don’t just break a person, they can also shape a person, gradually…\n\nChallenging times are like strong storms that blow against your soul. And it’s not just that these storms hold you back from places you might otherwise go, they also tear away from you all but the essential parts of you that cannot be torn, so that afterward you see yourself and your priorities as they really are in the present, without all the distractions you’ve been clinging to. In a very real sense, you are here to endure these storms, to risk your heart — to be bruised by life at times. And when it happens that you are hurt, or rejected, or knocked off course, let yourself remember that life’s challenges are necessary.\n\nIn all seasons of life, your goal shouldn’t be to seek a perfect and pain-free existence, but to live an imperfect and sometimes challenging one in radical amazement. To get up every morning and take a good look around in a way that takes nothing for granted. Everything is extraordinary in its own right. Every day is a gift. To be spiritual in any way is to be amazed in every way.\n\nAnd it’s important to note, too, that Angel and I don’t just preach. We’ve endured our own pain, crawled through our own strong storms, and learned from firsthand experience many times over. Over the past couple of decades we have dealt with several severe hardships, including the sudden death of a sibling, the loss of a best friend to illness, significant betrayal from a business partner, an unexpected breadwinning employment layoff that forced us out of our home, and more. These experiences were brutal. Each of them knocked us down hard and kept us down for a while. But when our time of mourning was over after each hardship, we pressed forward with a greater understanding and respect for life. (Angel and I discuss our journey and life story more in the books “Getting Back to Happy” and “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nYes, it’s your turn to own your story, and to not let life’s bitterness steal your sweetness. Remember, no life story is one chapter long, no chapter tells the whole tale, and no isolated event entirely defines who you are. Give yourself grace when you must, and keep turning the pages that need to be turned.\n\nBut before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂\n\nWhich tiny story above resonated the most today?

Starbucks’ newest branch is the perfect location for families.\n\nThe number of my kindergarten and elementary students who have told me about their mother’s love of Starbucks, and their most recent visit, is…uncountable. Calling Starbucks “popular in Japan” might possibly be the understatement of the century. It feels like not a day goes by where I don’t see someone carrying something emblazoned with the Starbucks logo. So, it’s no surprise that young children will often be seen in and around the stores, particularly in shopping malls. Starbucks stores are undeniably stylish, but child-friendly? Not exactly. With last year’s announcement of a store designed with families in mind at Aeon Lake Town Mall in Saitama, the intense popularity that ensued was to be expected.\n\n▼ Aeon Lake Town Mori 3F store in Koshigaya, Saitama\n\nSeeing how well-received their new branch was, Starbucks are taking the idea and rolling with it, with the second store having just opened in Osaka on April 10, and are keen to continue opening similar stores nationwide.\n\nDesigned to be a welcoming space where families with young children can relax, Starbucks have opened their new store in a spacious lawn area called Shibaniwa on the third floor of Aeon Mall Dainichi in Moriguchi, Osaka. Aeon Mall Dainichi is located next to Dainichi Station on the Tanimachi subway line and Osaka Monorail, easily accessible from Osaka City.\n\nThe wide layout allows easy accommodation of strollers and wheelchairs, even while sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee, so no more having to apologize to other customers who are trying to get past, or having to leave them outside.\n\nChildren can’t yet be expected to be coffee connoisseurs, reeling off orders like a “Venti cafe latte, soy milk, extra foam, two shots of signature espresso, and two pumps each of caramel and vanilla syrup,” so Starbucks are also bringing over their Kids Frappuccino range to help kids under 12 enjoy the experience. All drinks in the range are 440 yen (US$3.03) in-store and 432 yen for take-out, and come in the short size only. If you were hoping to pop into a nearby Starbucks and pick one up for your child, you might be out of luck as they are only available at these family-friendly stores.\n\n▼ Vanilla Cream (non-caffeinated), Mango and Fruit (non-caffeinated), Chocolate\n\nGiving children a hint of what wild options are available at the store, Starbucks are also including a hands-on experience at the “condiment bar” where parents and children can customize their drinks together.\n\nIf adults haven’t quite finished their conversation and the kids are getting a little restless, the store also provides original coloring sheets that, when completed, can be cut out and inserted into a custom Starbucks tumbler (1,800 yen).\n\nEven though this store is leaning heavily into the “fun for kids and families” angle, individuals and couples are welcome at the store too, and the regular menu is also available to order from. If instead you wanted a quieter atmosphere, there is still a regular shop on the first floor of the mall. With more locations likely on the horizon, Starbucks is brewing something special for families across Japan.\n\nStore information\n\nStarbucks Coffee Aeon Mall Dainichi 3-kai Shibaniwa-ten / スターバックス コーヒー イオンモール大日3階 SHIBANIWA店\n\nAddress: Osaka-fu, Moriguchi-shi, Dainichi Higashimachi 1-18 Aeon Mall Dainichi 3-kai\n\n大阪府守口市大日東町1-18イオンモール大日3階\n\nOpen: 10:00 a.m.-9:00 p.m.\n\nSource and top image: PR Times\n\nInsert images: PR Times (1, 2)\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

Japanese lighter company finds out", "fullContent": "If you can eat it, you can sear it.\n\nWhen dining at Japanese restaurants, you may come across an item described as “aburi” which is the Japanese word for seared, in that it was briefly exposed to a strong flame. This can caramelize desserts or give a smoky tinge to meats, bringing different flavors and textures to well-known foods.\n\nIt’s even easy to do at home if you have the right tools, such as the Aburi-shi (“Searing Master”) by Lightech. These disposable burner lighters sell for 550 yen (US$4) and instantly let you torch your favorite dishes with ease. This opens the door to a whole range of foods one wouldn’t think of searing, such as convenience store fare.\n\nSo, Lightech gathered a bunch of items from Family Mart, Lawson, and 7-Eleven, put them all under fire, and ranked the top three.\n\nIn third place was Sweet Red Bean Paste and Butter French Bread from Lawson. As you might imagine, this small baguette filled with sweet bean paste and butter benefits greatly from a little toasting. The bean paste is delightfully warmed and the butter melts into the crevices of the bread for an even more flavorful snack.\n\nThe second-best convenience store item to blaze up is the Spam Musubi with Three Kinds of Cheese from Family Mart. It’s like making a grilled cheese sandwich out of a rice ball with a variety of gooey cheese and fragrant, golden-brown surface.\n\nAnd the best item from a major convenience store chain to sear was found to be Chilled & Moist Baumkuchen from Family Mart. Here the sugary outer surface is caramelized to give it a crispy texture and bittersweet notes. It even looks more appetizing when seared, but don’t eat it too fast because it gets pretty hot this way.\n\nFans of 7-Eleven might be disappointed that none of their items cracked the Top 3, but Lightech also ranked each store’s items individually so we can still see what’s best among their offerings.\n\nIn third place was the Whipped Cream and Sweet Bean Paste Dorayaki, although the picture Lightech provided shows a fish-shaped taiyaki. I’m not sure if they made a mistake with the name or the picture, but I’m sure either one would taste rather nice with a dose of fire.\n\nIn second place was the chain’s Sweet Potato Flavored Yokan dessert and taking top honors was Salmon Sushi, which makes perfect sense since aburi salmon is a popular dish at a lot of revolving sushi restaurants.\n\nFamily Mart’s Top 3 should come as no surprise since we already saw two of them. Rounding out their elite offerings is their Aromatic Grilled Dried Squid, which apparently is even better when grilled again.\n\nAnd while the French bread with bean and butter is best at Lawson, we can see that it was followed by their Browned Corn and Mayonnaise bread when browned a little more in second place and their Tricolored Dango mochi dumplings in third.\n\nThey also made a video of the overall Top 10 items, showing the searing in action. Strangely, the dorayaki and taiyaki are both shown and since it doesn’t mention what store they came from, the mystery lingers about which one is 7-Eleven’s third. It’s probably the dorayaki though.\n\nOf course, taste is a subjective thing, so your favorite seared convenience store food might not even be on this list. Personally, I’m thinking a cinnamon bun would turn out pretty nice this way. But the only way to find out for sure is to put the fun back into burning food by getting yourself an Aburi-shi at your nearest fire dealer today.\n\nSource, images: PR Times\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

Black Ops 6's latest seasonal update is live, and after two years of remaining absent from the series, the return of Black Ops 6 3rd Person Mode is upon us. However, I have a feeling it won't be around for long.\n\nAlongside the resurrection of Verdansk in the battle royale game spin-off Call of Duty: Warzone, players heading into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer can experience the FPS game's sleek movement from a fresh perspective. The 3rd Person Moshpit playlist pits players against each other on a limited selection of maps, showcasing how solid Call of Duty's gunplay is from an over-the-shoulder viewpoint. There is something odd at first about playing a COD game this way, but Treyarch's smooth animations and omnimovement system arguably shine brighter here.\n\nUntil now, playing Black Ops 6 in third person is a luxury only Zombies players could enjoy. The feature exists across the entire mode, continuing over from Sledgehammer Games and Treyarch's usage of it in Modern Warfare Zombies. It also took the spotlight in a Modern Warfare 3 multiplayer playlist of its own.\n\nWith the rise of crossovers and more over-the-top cosmetics in the series, it isn't too surprising that third-person is on the cards.\n\nAfter all, how else are you going to see your operator skins in all their glory? I've been chewing up the arena as Jay and Silent Bob, which gives us the most surreal imagery of Clerks director Kevin Smith holding a Kilo 141 in the middle of a torn-up battlefield. 3rd Person Moshpit is live in Black Ops 6 right now, although it remains unclear as to whether it is a limited-time playlist or a permanent fixture to the game's multiplayer roster.\n\nFor more of the latest mobile hardware and gaming news, whether you're diving into the best Steam Deck games or the best Switch games, follow us on Google News to stay in the loop"}

During an appearance on “The Evening Edit,” Conway pointed to a surge of U.S. investments and job announcements tied to Trump’s economic agenda and said that Democrats have yet to present a serious alternative as they kept going against the president’s trade strategy.\n\n“So many corporations are hightailing it to 1600 [Pennsylvania Avenue] and saying ‘Hey, Mr. President, we’re opening up a new facility in North Carolina. We’re going to invest $20 billion in Americans and hire 5,000 new Americans in rural America over the next four or five years. And the White House is highlighting these success stories,” Conway told host Elizabeth MacDonald.\n\n“These American investment stories, Liz, it’s public knowledge. They’re putting it out every week. The Democrats don’t want to see it and acknowledge it. Some of these countries, Liz, are going to have to decide whether they’re for America or they’re for China. It sounds like some of these Democrats are going to have to decide [whether] they are for America or for China.”\n\nWATCH:\n\n\n\nWhen asked why Democrats haven’t offered a clear trade strategy, Conway said it’s because Trump has already shown the kind of strength and fairness Americans want. (RELATED: Josh Hawley Says Liberals ‘Going Crazy’ Because They Know Trump Is Right On China And Biden Wasn’t)\n\n“It’s called respect and fear. And I think this last election shows that Americans want strength over weakness, Liz, and they want fairness over unfairness. And what President Trump is doing and demonstrating with his trade and tariff agenda, with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, the energy dominance, the smaller government footprint, whatever that ends up looking like, all that needs to be priced into this tariff and trade strategy as well,” Conway said. “Look, I think if they do two, three, four deals that we know about, and that they can announce the beginnings of, it’s akin to the investments in America that so many corporations are making.”\n\nConway also criticized former President Barack Obama.\n\n“In the first 100 days of Donald Trump’s first term, former President Barack Obama, who failed to get Hillary Clinton his third term, felt the need to go and tell the Wall Street Journal in an interview what President Trump, what Americans should be doing. Isn’t that rich? He won’t even say it now, won’t agree with it,” Conway said. “Now, I didn’t hear him say much about that at all last fall when he was trying to prop up Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and Tim Walz. So the Democrats, everything Trump, clouds their minds.”\n\nSpeaking Thursday at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., Obama said standing up to Trump’s policies may demand personal sacrifice. On “Jesse Watters Primetime,” Victor Davis Hanson slammed Obama and said that his words clash with his own lifestyle, which he said erodes the former president’s credibility and weakens his public image.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

On “The Ingraham Angle,” host Laura Ingraham asked Towery whether Democrats’ attacks on Trump’s reciprocal tariffs were breaking through with voters.\n\n“No, not right now. If you look at the polls that are out by pollsters who did well in the 24 and 20 elections, President Trump has had a minor decrease in his approval rating, but very minor, not significant,” Towery said.\n\n“When you look at the pollsters — like Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight like to go to and push — who were way off. Oh, well, their averages have him way down. The truth is Trump is not off very much right now. The message is not resonating,” Towery added.\n\nAfter Trump announced April 2 that the U.S. would impose reciprocal tariffs on a list of countries, Democrats pushed back and criticized Trump’s trade policy. By Wednesday, Trump declared a 90-day pause on all tariffs except China’s.\n\nWATCH:\n\nDespite the market rebound, Democrats like Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Thursday that “chaos is still up.”\n\nTowery went on to say how some polls, like Quinnipiac, have Trump significantly down in approval, but added that Americans are more understanding of the president’s actions.\n\n“I think they’ve been waiting, Laura, for a time period when they could say ‘He’s falling apart,’ and they could rush in with these legacy media polls. But you haven’t seen them because it’s not happening. I mean, Quinnipiac said he’s down 12 [points],” Towery said.\n\n“Look, they missed the race last time by a mile. So if we listen to who really got the race right and knows how to poll Trump, this is not a big deal,” Towery added. “The American people are more understanding of what Trump is doing than the Wall Street pundits.”\n\nAccording to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, 41% of respondents approved of Trump’s job performance —down 12 points from CBS’ recent high but just one point lower than Quinnipiac’s March 13 poll.\n\nMeanwhile, a Rasmussen Reports poll released Friday had Trump at 48% approval. Additionally, a Harvard Caps Harris poll conducted between March 26-27 — notably prior to the tariffs’ announcement — shows Trump with a 49% approval rating.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Long term Feintool International Holding AG (VTX:FTON) shareholders know that all too well, since the share price is down considerably over three years. Regrettably, they have had to cope with a 76% drop in the share price over that period. And over the last year the share price fell 36%, so we doubt many shareholders are delighted. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 16% in the last 90 days.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver the three years that the share price declined, Feintool International Holding's earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. But it's safe to say we'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result!\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nSWX:FTON Earnings Per Share Growth April 12th 2025\n\nBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here .\n\nWhat About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?\n\nWe'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Feintool International Holding's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Dividends have been really beneficial for Feintool International Holding shareholders, and that cash payout explains why its total shareholder loss of 62%, over the last 3 years, isn't as bad as the share price return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWhile the broader market lost about 0.03% in the twelve months, Feintool International Holding shareholders did even worse, losing 34%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 9% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Feintool International Holding ."}

We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Cochlear. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 7.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nCochlear already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cochlear's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Cochlear.\n\nAnd institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 4.0% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 21% for shareholders. Often called “market movers\", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. Hence, if weakness in Cochlear's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.\n\nA look at the shareholders of Cochlear Limited ( ASX:COH ) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 51% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nStory Continues\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Cochlear\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur information suggests that Cochlear Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own AU$65m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 48% stake in Cochlear. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free .\n\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on AlzChem Group's ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for AlzChem Group is:\n\n26% = €54m ÷ €207m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every €1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of €0.26.\n\nView our latest analysis for AlzChem Group\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of AlzChem Group's Earnings Growth And 26% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that AlzChem Group has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 9.0% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, AlzChem Group's considerable five year net income growth of 21% was to be expected.\n\nAs a next step, we compared AlzChem Group's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 8.3%.\n\nXTRA:ACT Past Earnings Growth April 12th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is AlzChem Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide."}

The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI in a court case over the company’s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution.\n\nOpenAI claims that Musk has tried “nonstop” to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using “bad-faith tactics” against it to help him control AI technology.\n\nMusk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a “for-profit” company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity.\n\nOpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round.

They oppose renewing and expanding the Trump tax cuts because those cuts, they believe, benefit the rich over the poor. Elizabeth Warren and others on the left support a wealth tax — the seizure of a percentage of total assets of affluent Americans. Their proposals for taxing unrealized capital gains, for a minimum tax on the rich, and other new taxes all assume that affluent Americans have grown rich on the backs of the poor. It is exactly what Karl Marx meant when he wrote in The Communist Manifesto of “the exploitation of the laborer ... [who] is set upon by ... the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.”\n\nIn theory, Marxism seizes wealth from the rich and transfers it to workers. In reality, in every case where Marxism has actually been tried, wealth and the means to produce it are controlled by the State, not the workers. The only winners under Marxism are those who run the State, and never in 200 years has there been a Marxist ruler who shared wealth on an equal basis with the poor or who willingly returned power to the common people. Democrats resist Trump’s reforms because he aims to expose the lie of Marxism: the fraudulent idea that Democrat programs for the poor have done the poor any good. Instead, they have enriched Democrat leaders themselves and the enormous cohort of bureaucrats, academics, media, and others on the left.\n\nThe left’s resistance has turned violent, with firebombing of Tesla dealerships, death threats, assassination attempts, and violent protests at several universities. Very few Democrats have wholeheartedly condemned this violence, and some have urged the public to continue it.\n\nWhy is the left so violently opposed to Trump’s policies? Why did Democrats immediately turn to resistance instead of cooperation?\n\nIt is because Trump is shifting the nation’s thinking away from Marxism. Trump often speaks of restoring the American Dream, as he did on April 2 in his Rose Garden speech on tariffs. The American Dream is an idea that goes back to our nation’s founding, with Jefferson’s defense of the rights “of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” an idea echoed by Presidents Jackson, Coolidge, and Reagan. When President Trump spoke of making America wealthy again, he was repeating a quintessential conservative idea: that America is a providential society blessed with unlimited resources and that opportunity is a God-given right. That idea flies in the face of Marxism, and Democrats have chosen Marxism over the American Dream.\n\nDemocrats have always opposed Republican presidents. They opposed Reagan, but even that opposition was not as heated as it is now. When Democrats raised paddles with the word “Resist” during Trump’s address to Congress, they revealed what they were about. They were not taking issue with particular policies that might be debated and left to compromise; they resist Trump on the more general ground that he is unapologetic in his defense of American capitalism.\n\nDemocrats claim to care about the poor, but they did not stand to honor the ordinary Americans whom Trump invited to his congressional address. They sat with their arms folded across their chests and raised their little paddles as a sign of resistance. It made them look silly and weak.\n\nIt’s crucial to understand that left-wing resistance is based on the fear that Trump, by his success, will actually restore our nation’s faith in free-market economics. Democrats have been leading America on a long march toward socialism for more than a century and they refuse to give it up. Wilson instituted the personal income tax in 1913; FDR created an alphabet soup of agencies, supposedly to assist the poor; LBJ expanded those bureaucracies, including Medicare and Medicaid; Jimmy Carter added Title IX; Clinton attempted socialized medicine and “welfare without work” until he was reined in by voters at the polls; Obama and Biden picked up where Clinton failed.\n\nNone of those Democrats had a whole lot to say about the American Dream because that dream is based on the opportunity that capitalism affords the poor. Democrat resistance has always failed to recognize that capitalism is a better pathway to wealth than government handouts. Eighteen percent of U.S. households are millionaires; the vast majority of these millionaires, somewhere between 80 and 90 percent, are self-made, and it would be hard to believe that many of them were created by the kind of government programs that Bernie Sanders and AOC believe in and want to expand.\n\nThe reality is that Democrats are Marxists because they want government to control almost all wealth. When asked how much more the wealthy should pay, Democrats do not respond. As a start, Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax would collect two to three percent each year of the total wealth of those with more than $50 million in assets — but like all new taxes, the wealth tax would start small and eventually apply to everyone. There is no limit to what Democrats would confiscate — perhaps even 100 percent of private wealth. This is the very definition of communism.\n\nUnlike Trump’s subtle and transparent supply-side economic policies, the left’s “economic policy,” if you can call it that, does not focus on investing more capital and producing more goods. It consists of nothing more than stealing existing capital and distributing it to political clients in return for votes. It is no more subtle than what Lenin did when he seized the means of production, including agricultural production and private property, and condemned the rich to poverty and starvation.\n\nOrdinary Americans realize how dangerous and immoral Marxism is. They recognize that taxation, beyond a basic level necessary for national defense and other essential and constitutional functions, is wrong. They also know that new forms of taxation meant to apply only to the rich will eventually apply to themselves, as did the personal income tax, which initially applied to only a few citizens.\n\nWhy has the left so uniformly fallen into the mode of resistance? Why is there almost no effort to negotiate or compromise? It’s because, by way of his commitment to America First, Trump undermines their Marxist agenda. America First equates with individual opportunity and personal freedom — not exactly the hallmarks of communism. Liberals dream of global egalitarianism, with Americans no better off than Ugandans and with the state controlling most of the property and capital — and Trump stands in their way.\n\nThe success of Trump’s policies will put a stop to Marxism in America, at least for a while, just as the success of Reagan’s two terms set communism back on its heels until a new generation of socialists that included Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren stepped up and pretended that communism could do no harm. From the left’s point of view, Trump must not be allowed to succeed even if the country fails. “Resist” is the byword on the left because Trump’s success, and the success of America, will put the final nail in the coffin of Marxism.\n\nJeffrey Folks is the author of many books and articles on American culture.\n\nImage via Max Pixel."}

Despite being introduced as an innovative product with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities under the “Apple Intelligence” branding, several of its key features remain incomplete even six months after launch. This has led to widespread criticism, legal scrutiny, and growing concerns about Apple’s transparency and readiness to deliver on its ambitious promises. AppleTrack investigates further and provides an overview of the issues Apple AI is facing.\n\nUnfulfilled AI Promises\n\nApple’s announcement of the iPhone 16 was accompanied by bold claims about its AI-powered features, which were positioned as fantastic for the user experience. Central to these promises was a smarter Siri, designed to understand personal context and provide intuitive, proactive assistance. Additionally, features like on-screen awareness—allowing Siri to interpret and act on what users are viewing—and in-app actions to streamline interactions were heavily promoted as innovative advancements.\n\nHowever, these highly anticipated functionalities remain unavailable, leaving users with a device that feels incomplete compared to its advertised potential. The absence of these core features has sparked frustration among consumers, who expected a seamless integration of AI into their daily lives. This gap between marketing promises and actual performance has raised questions about Apple’s ability to deliver on its commitments.\n\nLimited AI Feature Rollout\n\nWhile Apple has introduced some AI-driven tools with the iPhone 16, they fall short of the innovation promised during its launch. These features, aimed at enhancing user experience, include notification summaries, photo cleanup tools, and Genoji avatars. However, their reception has been mixed, with many users finding them underwhelming:\n\nPhoto Cleanup Tools: Although functional, these tools offer only incremental improvements over similar features available on competing platforms, failing to set Apple apart in the crowded tech landscape.\n\nAlthough functional, these tools offer only incremental improvements over similar features available on competing platforms, failing to set Apple apart in the crowded tech landscape. Genoji Avatars: Designed to create personalized digital characters, these avatars have been criticized for their limited customization options, which restrict user creativity and engagement.\n\nThese incremental updates, while useful to some extent, lack the new impact that Apple’s marketing suggested. As a result, they have done little to distinguish the iPhone 16 from its competitors, leaving many users disappointed.\n\nMarketing Missteps and Controversy\n\nApple’s handling of the iPhone 16’s AI shortcomings has drawn significant criticism. Initially, the company heavily promoted the incomplete features, presenting them as fully functional innovations. However, following public backlash, Apple quietly removed references to these features from its advertisements and official website. This shift in messaging coincided with the filing of a class-action lawsuit accusing Apple of false advertising.\n\nCritics argue that Apple knowingly marketed features that were not ready for deployment, raising serious concerns about the company’s accountability and transparency. For a brand that has built its reputation on trust and reliability, this controversy has cast a shadow over its credibility. The situation has also sparked broader discussions about the ethical implications of promoting unfinished technologies in a highly competitive market.\n\nInternal Development Challenges\n\nReports from within Apple suggest that internal mismanagement may have played a significant role in the delays and shortcomings of the iPhone 16’s AI features. According to insiders, some engineers were reportedly unaware of the actual development status of key functionalities, such as the smarter Siri and on-screen awareness, at the time of the device’s announcement.\n\nThis has led to speculation that Apple showcased these features as conceptual ideas rather than fully developed technologies. Such revelations have further eroded consumer trust, as they suggest that the company may have prioritized meeting launch deadlines over making sure the readiness of its flagship features. For a company renowned for its meticulous attention to detail, these internal challenges represent a concerning departure from its usual standards.\n\nReputation at Risk\n\nThe controversy surrounding the iPhone 16 has overshadowed its other achievements, such as a refined design, improved battery life, and enhanced performance. While these upgrades are noteworthy, they have been largely overlooked due to the focus on AI feature delays and marketing missteps.\n\nFor Apple, a company synonymous with innovation and reliability, this situation poses a significant risk to its reputation. The iPhone 16’s struggles highlight the importance of aligning marketing strategies with product readiness to maintain consumer trust. As competitors continue to advance their own AI capabilities, Apple’s ability to recover from this setback will be critical in preserving its leadership in the tech industry.\n\nLegal and Consumer Fallout\n\nApple now faces mounting legal challenges, including a class-action lawsuit alleging misleading advertising. Critics argue that the company’s actions reflect a broader issue of prioritizing competitive positioning over delivering fully realized products. This has fueled consumer frustration, with many questioning whether Apple’s focus on maintaining its market dominance has come at the expense of transparency and product quality.\n\nMeanwhile, competitors are capitalizing on Apple’s missteps by advancing their own AI technologies, potentially threatening Apple’s position as an industry leader. The growing dissatisfaction among consumers underscores the need for Apple to address these issues promptly to avoid further erosion of its brand loyalty.\n\nFuture Implications\n\nThe launch of the iPhone 16 has highlighted the challenges Apple faces in delivering on its promises of new AI features. While some tools have been introduced, the absence of core functionalities like a smarter Siri and on-screen awareness has left many users disappointed. The resulting criticism, legal scrutiny, and reputational damage emphasize the importance of transparency, accountability, and product readiness in maintaining consumer trust.\n\nAs Apple moves forward, its ability to address these shortcomings will be crucial in shaping the future of its AI initiatives and its standing in the competitive tech landscape. By learning from the iPhone 16’s challenges, Apple has an opportunity to refine its approach and reaffirm its commitment to innovation and reliability.\n\nCheck out more relevant guides from our extensive collection on iPhone 16 that you might find useful.\n\nSource & Image Credit: AppleTrack\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

Just as important to the cafe experience is the ambiance, lingering in a cozy chair and soaking up the relaxing, inviting ambiance even after you’ve taken the last sip from your cup.\n\nCafe owners understand this too, which is why they generally don’t try to rush you out the door as soon as you’ve finished your drink. As a matter of fact, at a new cafe in the city of Yokohama, about 30 minutes south of downtown Tokyo, not only do you not have to leave right away, you’re technically not allowed to leave until you’ve solved a mystery.\n\nHatena Coffee, whose on-the-street sign you can see in the above photo, takes the first part of its name from hatena, the Japanese word for “question mark.” True to its name, it’s all about puzzles, riddles, and other brain-teasing mental challenges. Customers order not only a drink but a mystery too, with the understanding that you’re supposed to solve it before you go home.\n\nThe concept is similar to an escape room, but with a fundamental difference in tone. Escape rooms are all about trying to find the way out as quickly as possible. There’s usually a time limit, and with the goal being not just to solve the puzzles, but to solve them as quickly as possible, so you’re always aware of the ticking clock.\n\nHatena Coffee, on the other hand, wants to let you take your time with its mysteries, savoring them like you would a nice cup of coffee or a skillfully mixed cocktail (the cafe offers both soft drinks and alcoholic beverages). The management estimates that most of its puzzles will take between 30 to 60 minutes to solve, but there’s no rush as you figure out how to unlock boxes, decipher codes, or whatever else your mystery involves.\n\n▼ By the way, odds are that the staff will let you go home if you absolutely can’t solve your puzzle, so you could also think of the cafe’s policy as being that you can take as long as you like to solve it.\n\nAll drinks are priced at 500 yen (US$3.35) and all mysteries at 1,500 yen, with customers required to order one of each (though you can tack on more of either category after that). The puzzles are all created by Tantei Atalier, a group that also runs a chain of murder mystery game rooms, and while Hatena Coffee’s initial batch of puzzles is oriented towards newcomers to the hobby, the cafe says it plans to add more challenging ones too going forward. Oh, and if you can’t think on an empty stomach, they also serve sandwiches, pasta plates, and desserts with prices from 500 to 700 yen.\n\n▼ The cafe has also posted a mini teaser riddle, with some sort of special prize for those who can decode it and enter the correct answer at the linked URL.\n\nHatena Coffee is located about a five-minute walk from Yokohama Station. Walk-in customers are welcome, but reservations can be made online here. Note, however, that the cafe is only open on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays which are also not holidays, though it will be open on April 29 and 30 and May 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 for customers who wish to come in during the Golden Week vacation period. Admittedly, that’s a little complicated, but it’s also appropriate that it takes a little brain power to figure out when exactly the mystery cafe is open.\n\nCafe information\n\nHatena Coffee / はてな珈琲店\n\nAddress: Kanagawa-ken, Yokohama-shi, Kanagawa-ku, Tsuruya-cho 3-32-19, Aoyagi Building 3rd floor\n\n神奈川県横浜市神奈川区鶴屋町３丁目３２−１９ 青柳ビル 3階\n\nWebsite\n\nSource: PR Times, Hatena Coffee\n\nTop image: PR Times\n\nInsert images: Hatena Coffe, PR Times\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

You might assume you’re out of luck when it comes to airport lounges. After all, JetBlue doesn’t operate its own lounges, and many of its terminals aren’t known for lounge access. But depending on your airport and credit cards, you may still find a comfortable spot to relax before your flight.\n\nHere’s what JetBlue flyers can expect at the major NYC-area airports and in Orlando.\n\nNew York / New Jersey Airports\n\nJFK Airport (Terminal 5)\n\nLounge Access: None (Be Relax Spa is currently closed)\n\nWhat to Know: JetBlue’s main hub terminal at JFK. Terminal 5 has no airside lounges. Priority Pass members previously had access to the Be Relax Spa, but it is temporarily closed. That said, when it is open, it’s a decent place to wait for your flight, with free Wi-Fi and a rooftop terrace.\n\nNewark Airport (Terminal A)\n\nLounge Access: None\n\nWhat to Know: JetBlue now flies from the newly opened Terminal A, which replaced the old and overcrowded facility. While there are no lounges yet, there are plenty of dining and relaxation options. Priority Pass members (excluding AMEX and Capital One cardholders) can access the Be Relax Spa here. But note: Terminal A isn’t yet connected to the AirTrain, so accessing lounges in other terminals would involve a lengthy and inconvenient transfer.\n\nLaGuardia Airport (Terminal B)\n\nLounge Access:\n\n💳 AMEX Platinum : Centurion Lounge\n\n: Centurion Lounge 💳 Chase Sapphire Reserve / Ritz-Carlton : Sapphire Lounge\n\n: Sapphire Lounge 💳 Priority Pass: One visit/year to Sapphire Lounge\n\nWhat to Know: JetBlue flies from Terminal B, where eligible cardholders can access excellent lounge options. This is one of the best lounge situations for JetBlue flyers in NYC.\n\nWestchester County Airport\n\nLounge Access: None\n\nWhat to Know: Smaller airport with limited amenities. No lounges available.\n\nOrlando International Airport (Terminal C)\n\nJetBlue flies out of Terminal C at MCO, the newest terminal at the airport.\n\nLounge Access:\n\n💳 AMEX Platinum\n\n💳 Priority Pass\n\nWhat to Know: Although designed for international business class travelers, this lounge is available to eligible cardholders. When we visited, it was crowded due to delayed flights, but it still offered a more comfortable experience than waiting at the gate. If you don’t have access, Terminal C also features plenty of great food and drink options.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned JetBlue traveler or planning your first trip from NYC to Orlando, knowing your lounge options can make a big difference in how you start—or end—your journey. While JetBlue’s terminals aren’t overflowing with lounges, travelers with the right credit cards still have some solid opportunities to relax away from the gate. And even if you don’t score lounge access, a little planning can help you make the most of each airport. Safe travels—and if you find a new hidden gem in one of these terminals, let us know in the comments!\n\nWant to comment on this post? Great!
