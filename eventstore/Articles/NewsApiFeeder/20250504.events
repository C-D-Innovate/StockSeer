They’ll do their best to grind the agenda to a halt.”\n\nMidterm elections historically are painful for parties in power. And Democrats believe Trump’s sagging poll numbers and voter fears of an economic recession amid his trade war will be enough to win the narrowly divided House and give them a shot at the Senate majority, though the map is much tougher to flip that chamber.\n\nBut Trump is already showing intense personal interest in trying to buck the trend, Republican leaders say. In recent days, Trump has met privately with GOP leaders, including Johnson, to discuss candidate strategy and ways the White House can help in key races. Trump is signaling he will be fully engaged in the midterms, already planning more rounds of endorsements and offering to help in other ways, such as fundraisers and rallies, wherever he is needed, three GOP strategists said.\n\nAnd in the Senate, GOP leaders have been on an all-hands-on-deck push to woo perhaps their biggest recruit of the 2026 cycle: Gov. Brian Kemp in Georgia.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, along with Sen. Tim Scott, who leads the Senate GOP campaign arm, flew down to Atlanta over the Easter recess to discuss a potential run with Kemp and his wife, Marty. And the Georgia governor has sounded out senators for their advice, including Nebraska Sen. Pete Ricketts, a former governor himself, and Sen. Steve Daines, who used to run the Senate GOP campaign arm.\n\nAnd perhaps most importantly, Trump has spoken to Kemp about a potential Senate run — in February — when the nation’s governors were meeting in Washington, according to a source briefed on the conversation. While Trump made no commitments to Kemp, the fact that the president spoke with him has been viewed positively in GOP circles given that Trump lambasted the governor for years after Kemp refused to overturn the president’s 2020 election loss in Georgia.\n\n“It’s a very personal decision, but we’re going to give him every reason to run,” Thune told CNN, noting that Kemp was looking “over his options” and consulting with his family. “We’re all in.”\n\nIn multiple instances, Trump and his team have signaled they want to put up the best candidates — not simply the biggest MAGA acolytes — in a critical show of cooperation for a party that has been hobbled by ugly infighting over candidates in recent years, including between Trump and the party establishment in the 2022 midterms, according to multiple GOP strategists briefed on recent discussions.\n\n“They’re focusing on winning and finding the candidates that can win, period,” one GOP strategist said of the White House’s strategy.\n\nEven as Democrats believe Trump will be a huge liability for Republicans in the midterms, GOP leaders say they plan to fully embrace him — despite his polarizing politics — in a gamble to avoid their 2018 wipeout. One factor in their favor: Republicans are facing one of the narrowest House battlefields in recent memory, with roughly a dozen seats likely to determine the majority — with three Republicans holding seats in districts Kamala Harris won in 2024 compared with 13 Democrats in districts Trump carried.\n\nEven with some anxious about cratering poll numbers and ramifications of the trade war, many Republicans insist they can maintain control of Washington if they can successfully turn out Trump’s base.\n\n“President Trump’s gonna be crucial for us in keeping the House,” said Rep. Richard Hudson, the House GOP campaign chief, who met with Trump and his political team last week. “It’s gonna be critical for us to turn out that Trump coalition in the next election.”\n\nAsked whether swing-district Republicans should campaign with Trump next year, Hudson said: “Absolutely.”\n\nYet some swing-district Republicans are uncertain whether Trump will be helpful to their cause.\n\n“It’s always hard in a midterm year,” said Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, one of the three Republicans in a district Harris carried.\n\nBut Bacon also revealed he’s weighing retirement, a decision he’ll make over the summer that will have big ramifications for a hotly contested seat pivotal for House control.\n\n“I have a chance maybe for a third life,” Bacon said. “So just praying on it.”\n\nGeorgia on their minds\n\nKemp, the term-limited governor, has been torn about a possible run for Senate. He has, nonetheless, been the subject of a concerted lobbying push from the many Senate Republicans who believe that Georgia — and specifically, Kemp — hold the key to their midterm map.\n\nIf Kemp were to run, top Republicans believe it would give them their best shot at taking down first-term Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff — and make it nearly impossible for Democrats to flip the Senate, which stands at a 53-47 GOP advantage.\n\nDaines, the former Senate GOP campaign chief who is close to Trump, recently spent 30 minutes on the phone with Kemp. Daines said the two spoke extensively about life in the Senate.\n\n“He showed great interest [in] what the Senate is about, what it’s like, what you do here as a senator, and I tried to give him as much of my own experience from the inside, so that he has as much information as possible to make a decision,” Daines said of the phone call with Kemp.\n\nRicketts, the former Nebraska governor-turned-senator, hosted Kemp and other GOP governors for dinner at his townhouse earlier this year, in addition to multiple personal calls on the subject of running for Senate, according to a person familiar with the outreach.\n\nIt was during that same governors’ trip to Washington that Trump spoke to Kemp, the first source said. That same night, the president also offered effusive praise for the governor in his public remarks, calling him “fantastic” and thanking him for helping him win Georgia in 2024. “We did a great job together, and I appreciate it. We won’t forget it,” Trump said at the time.\n\nThat Georgia seat is seen as one of the GOP’s top pickup opportunities, alongside the open seats in Michigan and New Hampshire. The GOP is also on defense in two potentially difficult races in both Maine and North Carolina, while facing a bitter intraparty primary in Texas that could cost party resources and give Democrats an opening.\n\nMeanwhile, other Republicans are considering a run. Rep. Buddy Carter, who has represented a Savannah-area district for the past decade, has said he would look at the seat if Kemp does not run.\n\nAnd Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the hard-right firebrand and staunch Trump ally, did not rule out a run, when asked by CNN.\n\n“I’ve got a lot of options open to me. There’s the governor’s race, there’s the Senate race, and then there’s my district, which I love,” Greene said, referring to her northwest Georgia district. Asked about Kemp as a possible candidate, she said: “I’ve always been a strong supporter of our governor.”\n\nDemocrats not eager to talk Trump impeachment as MTG offers warning\n\nBut Greene also offered a word of warning to Republicans as they plot their midterm strategy, saying talk of impeachment won’t be good enough to win if they don’t pass Trump’s agenda in Congress and deliver on what their voters are demanding.\n\n“If the Republican campaign message in the midterms is to vote for House Republicans and vote for Republican candidates for Senate to stop the Democrats from impeaching Trump, the American people are not going to care because they’ve seen that show twice, and it didn’t matter,” Greene said. “It won’t work.”\n\nBack home in Georgia late last month, Ossoff caused a stir in Washington when he told a town hall audience that Trump has “already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment.” Within an hour of those comments Friday night, three separate GOP campaign groups had unleashed attacks on Ossoff.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has said little about whether he would push to impeach Trump a third time if his party can flip the House next year, despite being pressed about articles of impeachment recently filed by from one of his members, Rep. Shri Thanedar. The topic has not come up in private leadership or caucus meetings this year, multiple Democrats said, though Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive firebrand, told CNN last week that impeachment “should absolutely be on the table” if Democrats take the House.\n\nBut inside party leadership, there is no appetite to undertake that push, those Democrats said.\n\n“This is not an exercise that we’re willing to undertake,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, the No. 3 House Democrat, told reporters last week.\n\n“That’s just dumb,” Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said of the impeachment talk. “That’s not going anywhere.”\n\nAsked about his town hall comments, Ossoff said he stood by them but demurred when asked whether Democrats should pursue impeachment if the party retakes the House next year.\n\n“As I said last week, that kind of misconduct, I think, exceeds virtually any prior standard for that kind of inquiry in the House,” Ossoff told CNN, saying Trump is enriching himself through a cryptocurrency venture. “I can’t predict what a future House will do.”\n\nAsked whether he is concerned that Republicans will now weaponize his impeachment comments into his 2026 race, Ossoff replied: “I stand by those comments 100% and I think that the GOP should be concerned that the incumbent president appears to be selling access.”\n\nAs for a potential Kemp run, Ossoff seemed undeterred.\n\n“I am ready for any challenger,” the 38-year-old Democrat told CNN. “The pool is open. We’ll see who runs and I’m prepared.”\n\nCNN’s Casey Riddle, Ali es.ulpgc.dacd.businessunit.Main and Ileya Robinson-Williams contributed to this report."}

Here are 11 features you’re probably not using–but should", "fullContent": "These days, iPhones can do a lot – and we mean a lot. From photography and video editing to gaming and artificial intelligence, it’s enough to make you forget they can also, you know, make phone calls and send text messages.\n\nWith all these headline features, it’s not surprising that a bunch of clever capabilities slip through the cracks. Whether you’re an Apple veteran or an iOS newbie, we bet there are scores of interesting iPhone features that you never knew existed. Here, we’ve rounded up some of the best iPhone settings you’re probably not using.\n\nNameDrop: Easily share contacts\n\nNameDrop, which lets you touch two iPhones together to exchange contacts, is a great example of Apple’s seamless and intelligent integration between hardware and software, and it’s something that few other phone makers could pull off.\n\nJust bring the top ends of two iPhones running iOS 17 or later close to each other and hold them there until you see a bubble-like animation show on their displays. Once that happens, NameDrop will be shared between the two users like magic, and you can then choose the fields you want to share before exchanging your details or tap Receive Only to get their info without sending your own.\n\nAnd here’s a bonus: The feature also works when sending Apple Cash to another iPhone user.\n\nBack Tap: Add a button to the back of your iPhone\n\nSome iPhone features feel so natural that you wonder why you didn’t know about them before, and Back Tap certainly qualifies. With a quick double or triple tap on the back of your phone, you can open your camera app, turn on the flashlight, switch apps, and more.\n\nTo get started, open the Settings app on your iPhone and head to Accessibility > Touch > Back Tap. Select either Double Tap or Triple Tap, then pick an option from the extensive list. You can run system functions, activate accessibility controls, and even launch a shortcut, which is a clever way to kickstart a powerful workflow with minimal effort.\n\nFoundry\n\nVisual Look Up: Use the camera to learn about nature\n\nHow many times have you seen an animal or plant and found yourself scratching your head over what it was? With your iPhone, there’s no need to be left wondering what you saw – just use Visual Look Up.\n\nSimply snap a photo of the animal or plant in question, open the image in the Photos app, then swipe up. You’ll see an option to Look Up Plant or Look Up Animal, which will show likely matches and similar images.\n\nIf you have an iPhone with Camera Control, you can use the visual intelligence feature to tap into Apple Intelligence or ChatGPT to get similar assistance. Tap and hold the Camera Control for a couple of seconds until a new camera window bursts onto your screen. Point your camera at the object in question, and an animal or plant name will appear at the top. (If it says “Maybe,” tap the name to see a few options of what it could be. If ChatGPT is more certain, it will show the name of what it thinks it is, and you can tap it to get some information.)\n\nFoundry\n\nSong Recognition: Identify music that you hear\n\nShazam is a fantastic way to discover a new song or identify those earworm songs that you can’t quite remember the names of—but with your iPhone, you don’t need to open the Shazam app itself every time. You can put a handy Shazam button right into the Control Center for quick access instead.\n\nOpen the Control Center by swiping down from your iPhone’s top-right corner. From here, tap the + in the top-left corner, tap Add a Control, type “recognize music” in the search bar, and then tap the result. The next time you hear a song you can’t identify, open the Control Center and tap the Shazam button, and it’ll identify the song within seconds.\n\nFoundry\n\nTimer Control: Start a countdown in no time\n\nThere’s another handy hidden feature that can be found in the Control Center that lets you swiftly set up a timer without hunting for the Clock app.\n\nYou probably know that you can jump to the Timer section in the Clock app by tapping the dedicated Control Center button, but you might not know there’s an even shorter shortcut. Tap and hold the Timer button in the Control Center, and a slider will appear on your screen. Move your finger up or down the slider to increase or decrease the duration in one-minute increments and tap Start to begin.\n\nFlashlight: Adjust the width of your beam\n\nEveryone knows that your iPhone can provide a helpful flashlight to guide you through the darkness. But did you know that you can adjust the width and distance of its beam in just a few taps?\n\nTo do so, tap to turn on your phone’s flashlight (or ask Siri), and the icon will appear in the Dynamic Island. It’s not just a reminder that it’s on—tap it and you’ll be able to adjust the light beam by moving left (to make the beam narrower and more intense) or right (to make it wider and more diffuse). You can also move your finger up and down to increase or decrease the light’s strength as usual.\n\nFoundry\n\nMeasure: Use the iPhone’s hidden virtual ruler\n\nMost of us don’t carry tape measures around with us, but there are times when we need one. Not to worry – your iPhone actually has a hidden Measure app that can help.\n\nTo find it, tap the Search box on your iPhone’s Home screen and type “Measure” to find the Measure app. Open it, and it’ll activate the rear camera with two options: Measure and Level. To measure something, aim your phone at one edge of the object you want to measure, tap the plus (+) symbol, then move your camera to the other edge and tap the plus symbol again. The length of the object will appear on your screen. You can calculate multiple lengths by tapping + again after you’ve taken the first measurement.\n\nOn iPhone 12 Pro or later with a Lidar sensor, you can move your phone near the subject and the line will transform into a ruler that displays incremental units of length. Pro phones can also gauge the height of a person who appears in the Measure app’s viewfinder.\n\nFoundry\n\nWidgets: Get quick info on the Lock screen\n\nWidgets aren’t just for the Home screen—you can add a few to your Lock screen as well to view data at a glance.\n\nTo add widgets to your Lock Screen, tap and hold the screen until the Customize button appears. Tap it, then tap Lock Screen. Underneath the time, you’ll see an empty rectangle with a box labeled Add Widgets underneath it. Just tap any widgets from the list and they’ll be added to this box.\n\nFoundry\n\nApp Tracking: Stop apps from following your activity\n\nWhen you open an app for the first time, you might see a pop-up window asking if you want to let the app track you across other apps and websites. If you find yourself getting tired of repeatedly tapping “Ask App Not to Track,” there’s a simple fix that will reject tracking attempts once and for all.\n\nOpen the Settings app and navigate to Privacy & Security > Tracking, then disable the toggle next to Allow Apps to Request to Track. When you do this, you won’t get any more prompts about being tracked—disabling this toggle tells iOS to automatically reject all app tracking attempts on your behalf, so you can protect your privacy without all the annoying pop-ups.\n\nFor years, Apple devices have been heavily locked down, and that’s even extended to controlling your default apps for email, web browsing, and more. That’s no longer the case, though, so if you want to switch up your default apps, it’s now easier than ever.\n\nTo start customizing your app choices, open the Settings app and go to Apps > Default Apps. You’ll see several options, from email and messaging to web browsing and translation. Just tap one, then pick an app from the resulting list. Your options will be limited to apps installed on your iPhone, so make sure you’ve downloaded your apps of choice before getting started.\n\nFoundry\n\nText replacement: Give your thumbs a break\n\nTired of typing all the time? Use text replacement. This automatically fills out words and phrases when you enter a shortcut. For instance, you could create a text replacement shortcut that enters your email address whenever you type @@ or to automatically capitalize BBQ when you type bbq..\n\nThis feature can be enabled in Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement. There, tap + to add a new entry. The Shortcut box contains the condensed word or phrase you want to use, while the Phrase box is for the full version that will be inserted by your phone.\n\nAlternatively, if there’s a word or phrase that you don’t want to be corrected, create a new text replacement entry and type it into the same field, but keep the Shortcut box empty."}

Wait for all ongoing requests to finish. If a request takes too long, respond with a graceful error. Release critical resources such as database connections, file locks, or network listeners. Do any final cleanup.\n\nThis article focuses on HTTP servers and containerized applications, but the core ideas apply to all types of applications.\n\nFor further discussion on graceful shutdown practices in Go, see the conversations on Reddit and Hacker News.\n\n1. Catching the Signal\n\n#\n\nBefore we handle graceful shutdown, we first need to catch termination signals. These signals tell our application it’s time to exit and begin the shutdown process.\n\nSo, what are signals?\n\nIn Unix-like systems, signals are software interrupts. They notify a process that something has happened and it should take action. When a signal is sent, the operating system interrupts the normal flow of the process to deliver the notification.\n\nHere are a few possible behaviors:\n\nSignal handler : A process can register a handler (a function) for a specific signal. This function runs when that signal is received.\n\n: A process can register a handler (a function) for a specific signal. This function runs when that signal is received. Default action : If no handler is registered, the process follows the default behavior for that signal. This might mean terminating, stopping, continuing, or ignoring the process.\n\n: If no handler is registered, the process follows the default behavior for that signal. This might mean terminating, stopping, continuing, or ignoring the process. Unblockable signals: Some signals, like SIGKILL (signal number 9), cannot be caught or ignored. They may terminate the process.\n\nWhen your Go application starts, even before your main function runs, the Go runtime automatically registers signal handlers for many signals ( SIGTERM , SIGQUIT , SIGILL , SIGTRAP , and others). However, for graceful shutdown, only three termination signals are typically important:\n\nSIGTERM (Termination): A standard and polite way to ask a process to terminate. It does not force the process to stop. Kubernetes sends this signal when it wants your application to exit before it forcibly kills it.\n\n(Termination): A standard and polite way to ask a process to terminate. It does not force the process to stop. Kubernetes sends this signal when it wants your application to exit before it forcibly kills it. SIGINT (Interrupt): Sent when the user wants to stop a process from the terminal, usually by pressing Ctrl+C .\n\n(Interrupt): Sent when the user wants to stop a process from the terminal, usually by pressing . SIGHUP (Hang up): Originally used when a terminal disconnected. Now, it is often repurposed to signal an application to reload its configuration.\n\nPeople mostly care about SIGTERM and SIGINT . SIGHUP is less used today for shutdown and more for reloading configs. You can find more about this in SIGHUP Signal for Configuration Reloads.\n\nBy default, when your application receives a SIGTERM , SIGINT , or SIGHUP , the Go runtime will terminate the application.\n\nInsight: How Go Terminates Your Application\n\nWhen your Go app gets a SIGTERM , the runtime first catches it using a built-in handler. It checks if a custom handler is registered. If not, the runtime disables its own handler temporarily, and sends the same signal ( SIGTERM ) to the application again. This time, the OS handles it using the default behavior, which is to terminate the process.\n\nYou can override this by registering your own signal handler using the os/signal package.\n\nfunc main () { signalChan := make ( chan os . Signal , 1 ) signal . Notify ( signalChan , syscall . SIGINT , syscall . SIGTERM ) // Setup work here <- signalChan fmt . Println ( \"Received termination signal, shutting down...\" ) }\n\nGraceful shutdown begins with signal setup\n\nsignal.Notify tells the Go runtime to deliver specified signals to a channel instead of using the default behavior. This allows you to handle them manually and prevents the application from terminating automatically.\n\nA buffered channel with a capacity of 1 is a good choice for reliable signal handling. Internally, Go sends signals to this channel using a select statement with a default case:\n\nselect { case c <- sig : default : }\n\nThis is different from the usual select used with receiving channels. When used for sending:\n\nIf the buffer has space, the signal is sent and the code continues.\n\nIf the buffer is full, the signal is discarded, and the default case runs. If you’re using an unbuffered channel and no goroutine is actively receiving, the signal will be missed.\n\nEven though it can only hold one signal, this buffered channel helps avoid missing that first signal while your app is still initializing and not yet listening.\n\nNote You can call Notify multiple times for the same signal. Go will send that signal to all registered channels.\n\nWhen you press Ctrl+C more than once, it doesn’t automatically kill the app. The first Ctrl+C sends a SIGINT to the foreground process. Pressing it again usually sends another SIGINT , not SIGKILL . Most terminals, like bash or other Linux shells, do not escalate the signal automatically. If you want to force a stop, you must send SIGKILL manually using kill -9 .\n\nThis is not ideal for local development, where you may want the second Ctrl+C to terminate the app forcefully. You can stop the app from listening to further signals by using signal.Stop right after the first signal is received:\n\nfunc main () { signalChan := make ( chan os . Signal , 1 ) signal . Notify ( signalChan , syscall . SIGINT ) <- signalChan signal . Stop ( signalChan ) select {} }\n\nStarting with Go 1.16, you can simplify signal handling by using signal.NotifyContext , which ties signal handling to context cancellation:\n\nctx , stop := signal . NotifyContext ( context . Background (), syscall . SIGINT , syscall . SIGTERM ) defer stop () // Setup tasks here <- ctx . Done () stop ()\n\nYou should still call stop() after ctx.Done() to allow a second Ctrl+C to forcefully terminate the application.\n\n2. Timeout Awareness\n\n#\n\nIt is important to know how long your application has to shut down after receiving a termination signal. For example, in Kubernetes, the default grace period is 30 seconds, unless otherwise specified using the terminationGracePeriodSeconds field. After this period, Kubernetes sends a SIGKILL to forcefully stop the application. This signal cannot be caught or handled.\n\nYour shutdown logic must complete within this time, including processing any remaining requests and releasing resources.\n\nAssume the default is 30 seconds. It is a good practice to reserve about 20 percent of the time as a safety margin to avoid being killed before cleanup finishes. This means aiming to finish everything within 25 seconds to avoid data loss or inconsistency.\n\n3. Stop Accepting New Requests\n\n#\n\nWhen using net/http , you can handle graceful shutdown by calling the http.Server.Shutdown method. This method stops the server from accepting new connections and waits for all active requests to complete before shutting down idle connections.\n\nHere is how it behaves:\n\nIf a request is already in progress on an existing connection, the server will allow it to complete. After that, the connection is marked as idle and is closed.\n\nIf a client tries to make a new connection during shutdown, it will fail because the server’s listeners are already closed. This typically results in a “connection refused” error.\n\nIn a containerized environment (and many other orchestrated environments with external load balancers), do not stop accepting new requests immediately. Even after a pod is marked for termination, it might still receive traffic for a few moments.\n\nKubernetes internal components like kube-proxy are quickly aware of the change in pod status to “Terminating”. They then prioritize routing internal traffic to Ready,Serving endpoints over Terminating,Serving ones.\n\nThe external load balancer, however, operates independently from Kubernetes. It typically uses its own health check mechanisms to determine which backend nodes should receive traffic. This health check indicates whether there are healthy ( Ready ) and non-terminating pods on the node. However, this check needs a little time to propagate.\n\nThere are 2 ways to handle this:\n\nUse a preStop hook to sleep for a while, so the external load balancer has time to recognize that the pod is terminating. lifecycle : preStop : exec : command : [ \"/bin/sh\" , \"-c\" , \"sleep 10\" ] And really importantly, the time taken by the preStop hook is included within the terminationGracePeriodSeconds . Fail the readiness probe and sleep at the code level. This approach is not only applicable to Kubernetes environments, but also to other environments with load balancers that need to know the pod is not ready.\n\nWhat is readiness probe?\n\nA readiness probe determines when a container is prepared to accept traffic by periodically checking its health through configured methods like HTTP requests, TCP connections, or command executions. If the probe fails, Kubernetes removes the pod from the service’s endpoints, preventing it from receiving traffic until it becomes ready again.\n\nTo avoid connection errors during this short window, the correct strategy is to fail the readiness probe first. This tells the orchestrator that your pod should no longer receive traffic:\n\nvar isShuttingDown atomic . Bool func readinessHandler ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) { if isShuttingDown . Load () { w . WriteHeader ( http . StatusServiceUnavailable ) w . Write ([] byte ( \"shutting down\" )) return } w . WriteHeader ( http . StatusOK ) w . Write ([] byte ( \"ok\" )) }\n\nDelay shutdown by failing readiness first\n\nThis pattern is also used as a code example in the test images. In their implementation, a closed channel is used to signal the readiness probe to return HTTP 503 when the application is preparing to shut down.\n\nAfter updating the readiness probe to indicate that the pod is no longer ready, wait a few seconds to allow the system time to propagate the change.\n\nThe exact wait time depends on your readiness probe configuration; we will use 5 seconds for this article with the following simple configuration:\n\nreadinessProbe : httpGet : path : /healthz port : 8080 periodSeconds : 5\n\nThis guide only gives you the idea behind graceful shutdown. Planning your graceful shutdown strategy depends on your application’s characteristics.\n\n4. Handle Pending Requests\n\n#\n\nNow that we are shutting down the server gracefully, we need to choose a timeout based on your shutdown budget:\n\nctx , cancelFn := context . WithTimeout ( context . Background (), timeout ) err := server . Shutdown ( ctx )\n\nThe server.Shutdown function returns in only two situations:\n\nAll active connections are closed and all handlers have finished processing. The context passed to Shutdown(ctx) expires before the handlers finish. In this case, the server gives up waiting.\n\nIn either case, Shutdown only returns after the server has completely stopped handling requests. This is why your handlers must be fast and context-aware. Otherwise, they may be cut off mid-process in case 2, which can cause issues like partial writes, data loss, inconsistent state, open transactions, or corrupted data.\n\nA common issue is that handlers are not automatically aware when the server is shutting down.\n\nSo, how can we notify our handlers that the server is shutting down? The answer is by using context. There are two main ways to do this:\n\na. Use context middleware to inject cancellation logic\n\n#\n\nThis middleware wraps each request with a context that listens to a shutdown signal:\n\nfunc WithGracefulShutdown ( next http . Handler , cancelCh <- chan struct {}) http . Handler { return http . HandlerFunc ( func ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) { ctx , cancel := WithCancellation ( r . Context (), cancelCh ) defer cancel () r = r . WithContext ( ctx ) next . ServeHTTP ( w , r ) }) }\n\nb. Use BaseContext to provide a global context to all connections\n\n#\n\nHere, we create a server with a custom BaseContext that can be canceled during shutdown. This context is shared across all incoming requests:\n\nongoingCtx , cancelFn := context . WithCancel ( context . Background ()) server := & http . Server { Addr : \":8080\" , Handler : yourHandler , BaseContext : func ( l net . Listener ) context . Context { return ongoingCtx }, } // After attempting graceful shutdown: cancelFn () time . Sleep ( 5 * time . Second ) // optional delay to allow context propagation\n\nIn an HTTP server, you can customize two types of contexts: BaseContext and ConnContext . For graceful shutdown, BaseContext is more suitable. It allows you to create a global context with cancellation that applies to the entire server, and you can cancel it to signal all active requests that the server is shutting down.\n\nFull graceful shutdown with propagation delay\n\nAll of this work around graceful shutdown won’t help if your functions do not respect context cancellation. Try to avoid using context.Background() , time.Sleep() , or any other function that ignores context.\n\nFor example, time.Sleep(duration) can be replaced with a context-aware version like this:\n\nfunc Sleep ( ctx context . Context , duration time . Duration ) error { select { case <- time . After ( duration ): return nil case <- ctx . Done (): return ctx . Err () } }\n\nLeaking Resources\n\nIn older versions of Go, time.After can leak memory until the timer fires. This was fixed in Go 1.23 and newer. If you’re unsure which version you’re using, consider using time.NewTimer along with Stop and an optional <-t.C check if Stop returns false. See: time: stop requiring Timer/Ticker.Stop for prompt GC\n\nAlthough this article focuses on HTTP servers, the same concept applies to third-party services as well. For example, the database/sql package has a DB.Close method. It closes the database connection and prevents new queries from starting. It also waits for any ongoing queries to finish before fully shutting down.\n\nThe core principle of graceful shutdown is the same across all systems: Stop accepting new requests or messages, and give existing operations time to finish within a defined grace period.\n\nSome may wonder about the server.Close() method, which shuts down the ongoing connections immediately without waiting for requests to finish. Can it be used after server.Shutdown() returns an error?\n\nThe short answer is yes, but it depends on your shutdown strategy. The Close method forcefully closes all active listeners and connections:\n\nHandlers that are actively using the network will receive errors when they try to read or write.\n\nThe client will immediately receive a connection error, such as ECONNRESET (‘socket hang up’)\n\n(‘socket hang up’) However, long-running handlers that are not interacting with the network may continue running in the background.\n\nThis is why using context to propagate a shutdown signal is still the more reliable and graceful approach.\n\n5. Release Critical Resources\n\n#\n\nA common mistake is releasing critical resources as soon as the termination signal is received. At that point, your handlers and in-flight requests may still be using those resources. You should delay the resource cleanup until the shutdown timeout has passed or all requests are done.\n\nIn many cases, simply letting the process exit is enough. The operating system will automatically reclaim resources. For instance:\n\nMemory allocated by Go is automatically freed when the process terminates.\n\nFile descriptors are closed by the OS.\n\nOS-level resources like process handles are reclaimed.\n\nHowever, there are important cases where explicit cleanup is still necessary during shutdown:\n\nDatabase connections should be closed properly. If any transactions are still open, they need to be committed or rolled back. Without a proper shutdown, the database has to rely on connection timeouts.\n\nshould be closed properly. If any transactions are still open, they need to be committed or rolled back. Without a proper shutdown, the database has to rely on connection timeouts. Message queues and brokers often require a clean shutdown. This may involve flushing messages, committing offsets, or signaling to the broker that the client is exiting. Without this, there can be rebalancing issues or message loss.\n\noften require a clean shutdown. This may involve flushing messages, committing offsets, or signaling to the broker that the client is exiting. Without this, there can be rebalancing issues or message loss. External services may not detect the disconnect immediately. Closing connections manually allows those systems to clean up faster than waiting for TCP timeouts.\n\nA good rule is to shut down components in the reverse order of how they were initialized. This respects dependencies between components.\n\nGo’s defer statement makes this easier since the last deferred function is executed first:\n\ndb := connectDB () defer db . Close () cache := connectCache () defer cache . Close ()\n\nSome components require special handling. For example, if you cache data in memory, you might need to write that data to disk before exiting. In those cases, design a shutdown routine specific to that component to handle the cleanup properly.\n\nSummary\n\n#\n\nThis is a complete example of a graceful shutdown mechanism. It is written in a flat and straightforward structure to make it easier to understand. You can customize it to fit your application as needed, using errgroup , WaitGroup , or any other patterns:\n\nconst ( _shutdownPeriod = 15 * time . Second _shutdownHardPeriod = 3 * time . Second _readinessDrainDelay = 5 * time . Second ) var isShuttingDown atomic . Bool func main () { // Setup signal context rootCtx , stop := signal . NotifyContext ( context . Background (), syscall . SIGINT , syscall . SIGTERM ) defer stop () // Readiness endpoint http . HandleFunc ( \"/healthz\" , func ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) { if isShuttingDown . Load () { http . Error ( w , \"Shutting down\" , http . StatusServiceUnavailable ) return } fmt . Fprintln ( w , \"OK\" ) }) // Sample business logic http . HandleFunc ( \"/\" , func ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) { select { case <- time . After ( 2 * time . Second ): fmt . Fprintln ( w , \"Hello, world!\" ) case <- r . Context (). Done (): http . Error ( w , \"Request cancelled.\" , http . StatusRequestTimeout ) } }) // Ensure in-flight requests aren't cancelled immediately on SIGTERM ongoingCtx , stopOngoingGracefully := context . WithCancel ( context . Background ()) server := & http . Server { Addr : \":8080\" , BaseContext : func ( _ net . Listener ) context . Context { return ongoingCtx }, } go func () { log . Println ( \"Server starting on :8080.\" ) if err := server . ListenAndServe (); err != nil && err != http . ErrServerClosed { panic ( err ) } }() // Wait for signal <- rootCtx . Done () stop () isShuttingDown . Store ( true ) log . Println ( \"Received shutdown signal, shutting down.\" ) // Give time for readiness check to propagate time . Sleep ( _readinessDrainDelay ) log . Println ( \"Readiness check propagated, now waiting for ongoing requests to finish.\" ) shutdownCtx , cancel := context . WithTimeout ( context . Background (), _shutdownPeriod ) defer cancel () err := server . Shutdown ( shutdownCtx ) stopOngoingGracefully () if err != nil { log . Println ( \"Failed to wait for ongoing requests to finish, waiting for forced cancellation.\" ) time . Sleep ( _shutdownHardPeriod ) } log . Println ( \"Server shut down gracefully.\" ) }\n\nWho We Are\n\n#\n\nIf you want to monitor your services, track metrics, and see how everything performs, you might want to check out VictoriaMetrics.

The first story is so familiar it hardly warrants retelling. It goes like this. The Internet is breaking the old powers of the state, the media, the church, and every other institution. It is even breaking society itself. By subjecting their helpless users to ever more potent algorithms to boost engagement, powerful platforms distort reality and disrupt our politics. YouTube radicalizes young men into misogynists. TikTok turns moderate progressives into Hamas supporters. Facebook boosts election denialism; or it censors stories doubting the safety of mRNA vaccines. On the world stage, the fate of nations hinges on whether Twitter promotes color revolutions, WeChat censors Hong Kong protesters, and Facebook ads boost the Brexit campaign. The platforms are producing a fractured society: diversity of opinion is running amok, consensus is dead.\n\nFrom the Special Series: Reality: A Post-Mortem\n\nThe second story is very different. In the 2023 essay “The age of average,” Alex Murrell recounts a project undertaken in the 1990s by Russian artists Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid. The artists commissioned a public affairs firm to poll over a thousand Americans on their ideal painting: the colors they liked, the subjects they gravitated toward, and so forth. Using the aggregate data, the artists created a painting, and they repeated this procedure in a number of other countries, exhibiting the final collection as an art exhibition called The People’s Choice. What they found, by and large, was not individual and national difference but the opposite: shocking uniformity — landscapes with a few animals and human figures with trees and a blue-hued color palette.\n\nAnd it isn’t just paintings that are converging, Murrell argues. Car designs look more like each other than ever. Color is disappearing as most cars become white, gray, or black. From Sydney to Riyadh to Cleveland, an upscale coffee shop is more likely than ever to bear the same design features: reclaimed wood, hanging Edison bulbs, marble countertops. So is an Airbnb. Even celebrities increasingly look the same, with the rising ubiquity of “Instagram face” driven by cosmetic injectables and Photoshop touch-ups.\n\nMurrell focuses on design, but the same trend holds elsewhere: Kirk Goldsberry, a basketball statistician, has shown that the top two hundred shot locations in the NBA today, which twenty years ago formed a wide array of the court, now form a narrow ring at the three-point line, with a dense cluster near the hoop. The less said about the sameness of pop melodies or Hollywood movies, the better.\n\nAs we approach the moment when all information everywhere from all time is available to everyone at once, what we find is not new artistic energy, not explosive diversity, but stifling sameness. Everything is converging — and it’s happening even as the power of the old monopolies and centralized tastemakers is broken up.\n\nAre the powerful platforms now in charge? Or are the forces at work today something even bigger?\n\nI. The Rise of the Network\n\nProfessor Hayek’s Elegant Argument\n\nFor decades after the First World War and the Russian Revolution, the profession of economics roiled with a theoretical debate with enormous practical consequences. The question was whether economies grew by getting better at calculation or at something else. During the war, each of the major combatants had engaged in massive economic mobilization, with varying levels of centralized planning of war production. Famously, after the war the revolutionary Soviet government instituted a centralized planning system. Would it work?\n\nThe first round of the socialist calculation debate, kicked off by Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises in 1920, argued that “rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth,” because central planners had no mechanism to efficiently coordinate supply and demand. By contrast, market economies had a decentralized planner of a size and scope vastly more efficient than any computing power then available: the price system. Socialist economists took Mises’s argument in stride, on the one hand theorizing forms of decentralized planning called “market socialism,” and on the other developing new mathematical techniques to solve calculation problems, like the Nobel Prize–winning discovery of linear programming by Leonid Kantorovich. Whatever other challenges remained, calculation per se did not seem to pose an insuperable problem for economic planning.\n\nIn the 1945 essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society,” Mises’s student Friedrich von Hayek took the problem deeper than mere calculation. The fundamental barrier to central planning was not the decentralized distribution of desire or need but of knowledge. Market participants have unique local knowledge about the circumstances they face: the costs of making something, what they would accept as substitutes, their beliefs (right or wrong) about what other people might want. This knowledge was impossible to summarize and convey to a centralized planner, not least because it was in motion, “constantly communicated and acquired.” This knowledge operates not only through buying and selling but through making a prototype, viewing the available wares, shutting a business down, taking out a loan, and many more kinds of human activity. What makes markets efficient is not that they are better at arriving at a full accounting of supply and demand than a centralized planner, but that they never require anything like full knowledge in the first place, allowing decentralized coordination across actors who each only have partial knowledge of the whole. The old conceit of a market as an auction where buyers and sellers met at a single clearinghouse hid a social structure that was much more complex.\n\nFor Hayek, the market is not a price system or an auction. It is a network.\n\n‘Intergalactic Computer Network’\n\nThe Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, or ARPANET, was not the first computer network, but it was the most important. Built in the 1960s, it was the first to show what could happen if you emphasized the network rather than the computer.\n\nDuring the birth pangs of the Information Revolution, computing power was precious. It was the era of the mainframe, massive heaping computers the size of entire rooms, where various functions like working memory and disk space occupied separate cabinets. In this paradigm, networking was how you connected terminals, peripherals, or smaller computers to the coveted power of the mainframe. At a satellite location, you might work on a program or feed in some data from a terminal, but you needed to run it on the mainframe. And so did everyone else. This hub-and-spoke structure dictated everything. Network capacity was about the power of the mainframe, with computing resources metered like an electric utility. Inconsistent workloads meant that programmers used “batch processing” and multi-user time-sharing, running programs as computing resources became available.\n\nThe mainframe sat at the center of a closed system. To work, everything had to be keyed to its needs, including the programming languages you used and the compatible peripherals you attached.\n\nIt is sometimes said that the Advanced Research Projects Agency created ARPANET in order to provide for command and control in the case of nuclear war. While this use case helped motivate RAND Corporation researcher Paul Baran’s development of distributed communications theory, it didn’t have anything to do with the motivations and goals of the people actually building ARPANET. And ARPANET didn’t really solve any problems for the big research laboratories, who already had powerful mainframes and who expressed wariness about the network “stealing” computing time from them. The engineer who was first presented with the request to actually build ARPANET said, “I can’t see what one would want such a thing for.”\n\nSo what was it for? The aim of ARPANET was to revolutionize human communication. That was the vision of J.C.R. Licklider, who jokingly referred to his vision of an “Intergalactic Computer Network” in which programmers could access resources and people anywhere in the network. This vision was elaborated by Bob Taylor, who imagined how the communities of researchers that were then beginning to form around individual mainframes could one day form around entire computing networks. Together the two wrote the seminal 1968 article “The Computer as a Communication Device,” in which they predicted that “in a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face.”\n\nCommunity, self-organization, and the expansion of human consciousness were baked in from the start. That was why so many members of the California-centered Human Potential Movement became early enthusiasts and adopters of networked computing. The Stanford Research Institute formed one half of the first-ever ARPANET exchange. And the Stanford group that worked on ARPANET was initially called the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center, led by Douglas Engelbart. Senior leaders like Engelbart, not to mention almost all the junior computer engineers who worked for him, were fully immersed in the California counterculture, as John Markoff showed in his 2005 book What the Dormouse Said. The project was the computational equivalent of the counterculture’s interest in reorganizing society by breaking free of imposed constraints and social norms in favor of new practices.\n\nYou can draw a straight line from the 1966 LSD-soaked Trips Festival to the 1967 Summer of Love to Engelbart’s 1968 “Mother of All Demos,” a public demonstration of how new networking and interface technologies would revolutionize how people worked together. If you had to give that straight line a name, it would be Stewart Brand, founder of the Whole Earth Catalog. ARPANET was ultimately not about getting computers to talk to each other; it was about getting people to talk to each other, to collaborate and work together and organize across distances. Anyone could connect to anyone or any resource to build anything: the “incredible popularity and success of network mail” was the “largest single surprise” of the entire project, according to the project’s completion report.\n\nTo get this to work, you needed to go beyond systems that were built to communicate to systems that were designed to communicate. Before ARPANET, distributed computer networks, like those used by airlines or the military, were built for distinct purposes, using hardware from the same vendors, custom systems integration, and a final plan of what the network would look like and what it was for. If you tried to add new hardware to the network or took out a mainframe that other parts of the system depended on, the whole thing could break.\n\nARPANET researchers overcame numerous technical challenges to build a network with the opposite approach. Different kinds of computers, using a machine called a router, could talk to each other. Special algorithms allowed data to get to the right place without the need for a perfect map of the whole network, which was constantly changing. As long as you spoke in the same language, you could add new parts to the network without getting anyone’s permission. Take a node off-line, and the network routes around it.\n\nTo describe the kind of communications required to get the network to function like this, researchers borrowed a term previously used for social etiquette or diplomatic convention. They called the grammar that computers used to talk to each other a protocol. Each protocol would consist of a formal procedure, a standard for interacting with a system, which anyone could adopt. For instance, just as mailing addresses have their own protocol, ARPANET would create protocols for addressing objects in the network. In the counterculture-inspired vision of Engelbart and his hackers, protocols would be developed and maintained by the community of users, open for anyone and free to license.\n\nThe vendor-driven computer systems beloved by the men in gray flannel suits got things to work by handcuffing the user: to specific hardware, specific computer languages, specific rules. The ARPANET vision of networked computers was of computing unshackled, as portrayed most powerfully in Apple’s iconoclastic 1984 Super Bowl ad, with Orwell’s centralized dystopia being literally demolished. You are totally free to build on top of the protocol, or to extend it different ways. It’s a carrot, not a stick. The reason to constrain yourself to the protocol standards is the power of building something that works with everything else that does the same. The protocol wasn’t just a useful software invention — it was a worldview.\n\nSimCity\n\nThe problem was scale. When you expand anything — a factory, a railroad, a community, a democracy — to a certain size, communication can break down in surprising ways. The sheer complexity of interrelationships and interdependencies becomes impossible to keep track of. This has always been the case, and new organizational technologies — the file cabinet, the mimeograph, the punch-card tabulator — have always been developed to help keep up with the deluge. But even in the era of mainframe computers, the complexity and amount of data began to outstrip the ability of any one decision-maker to make sense of it all. As Licklider and Taylor had put it in their 1968 article, “society rightly distrusts the modeling done by a single mind.” It was in the 1970s that the word “scalable,” in the sense of a system you can enlarge without breaking it, appears to have entered into the English lexicon.\n\nOr maybe the complexity was always there, and it was just that modern computers gave us the tools to notice it with the right data, to see how the butterfly flapping its wings caused the hurricane. After all, mathematician Edward Norton Lorenz conceptualized the “Butterfly Effect” not on a chalkboard but when he made a minor typo entering meteorological data into a weather simulation and found a shockingly different result.\n\nIn the 1970s, two trends combined to shape the zeitgeist: sophisticated computer simulations of complex systems and ecological thinking driven by a sense that everything was connected — a realization fueled variously by atmospheric nuclear weapons testing, consciousness-boosting LSD trips, and the first pictures of the whole Earth from outer space. Thinking about inputs and outputs like a factory assembly line was out. Holistic thinking about feedback loops and emergent properties was in.\n\nAnd it came with a new computing paradigm, too: cellular automata. If you tried to create a whole system all at once, God’s-eye-view-linear-programming-style, even the largest mainframe computers would spaz out with only a few variables. But you could imitate much more complex systems — like cities, rainforests, or weather patterns — using only a few parameters. In the 1970s, British mathematician John Conway’s Game of Life showed the way. Technically known as a cellular automaton, the Game of Life is essentially a large game of tic-tac-toe that plays itself. By creating a grid of cells that are either filled or empty, and simple rules for how each cell changes based on its neighbors, complex patterns emerge.\n\nBring this new computing paradigm together with books like Jay Forrester’s Urban Dynamics (which used computer simulations to model cities) and Jane Jacobs’s The Death and Life of Great American Cities (an attack on the linear modernism of urban planning, focusing instead on the city as an organic system) and you get a new, and addictively fun, way of making sense of the world: the simulation video game.\n\nWill Wright’s 1989 game SimCity allowed players to design and manage their own virtual cities, dealing with everything from city budgets and infrastructure to disasters. The challenge came from each of the underlying systems shaping the others in unpredictable ways. Summon an off-brand Godzilla to maraud through your city, and watch the housing density pattern and the road network change in the subsequent re-development.\n\nEmergent properties, ecological thinking, self-organizing systems, complex interdependence — the whole paradigm is there on screen, re-wiring not only the virtual city but the player’s view of the world.\n\nII. Protocol Society\n\nThe Bezos Mandate\n\nSometime around 2002, Jeff Bezos issued a mandate that would lay the foundation for Amazon to become one of the biggest companies in the world.\n\nAmazon was growing like gangbusters and re-investing all of its profits into growing more. Having survived the dot-com bust, the company now found itself at the forefront of e‑commerce just as a majority of American adults logged on to the Internet.\n\nAmazon discovered that you could not run a company at the scale of the global Internet the way you ran a normal company. At that scale — not only of users, but of data, of speed, of items for sale, and of revenue — it was easy for things to break.\n\nBezos’s mandate was designed to force every team, every product manager, every engineer to build for scale. And it had some extraordinary second-order consequences. The mandate was immortalized by former Amazon software engineer Steve Yegge, who, after going to Google, was trying to explain why Amazon was in many ways a more successful company. He thought the mandate held part of the answer.\n\nBezos’s earth-shattering mandate, as remembered by Yegge, went like this:\n\nAll teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces. Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces. There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed…. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network…. All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world.\n\nIt isn’t necessary to understand the technical details, or why issuing this mandate in the dial-up Internet era was, in Yegge’s words, a “huge and eye-bulgingly ponderous” act. To simplify, traditional software teams would build new features that hooked into existing programs. If you wanted to allow users to subscribe to a product, you might pull their address information from an existing database and build your new subscription software on top of existing programs that allowed you to charge a user’s credit card. This approach is resource-efficient, but it creates dependencies, obvious and not-so-obvious ways in which new programs rely on older ones. With Bezos’s mandate, the Amazon teams were forbidden to do any of that. Each program needed to run entirely on its own, hooking in to other Amazon services only by sending them a defined set of inputs and receiving and reacting to a defined set of outputs. That is what a service interface means.\n\nBy analogy, imagine if you took a restaurant kitchen and made each station its own mini-business. Making a hamburger would mean buying the raw meat from the refrigerator, paying the griddle to take the meat and receiving a cooked patty in return, then paying the condiment station, and so on.\n\nAt an individual scale, this would be insane. But the traditional model breaks down as you make it larger and larger, scaling to millions of hamburgers in thousands of locations. There’s a reason most restaurants don’t slaughter their own cattle. At increasing scale, success depends on your ability to balance across a supply network, route around bottlenecks or breakdowns, and solve problems in a decentralized way. It looks like a market. It looks like a network.\n\nHave extra server capacity? Let anybody purchase it (Amazon Web Services). Building a warehouse infrastructure? Let anybody use it (Fulfillment by Amazon). Have a shipping service? Let anybody deliver through it (Amazon Shipping). But the new businesses Amazon created only scratch the surface of the new kind of organization the company achieved. Amazon transformed every aspect of its business from the logic of mainframe computing to the logic of networked computing, and it did so by requiring every part of its business to communicate in protocols.\n\nConway’s Law says that organizations build systems that are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. In order to match his ambitions, Bezos had to reorganize Amazon for global scale. The mandate made Amazon into a business shaped like the Internet.\n\nThe New Order\n\nWhile they don’t agree on much else, critics and champions of contemporary capitalism share an assessment of the most important transformation of late-twentieth-century economics. The political economy of the mid-century, particularly in America and Europe, had been characterized by trends toward social democracy, environmental conservation, regulation of labor practices, and rising income taxes. Compared to the era before World War I, there were higher levels of tariffs and trade protectionism, more barriers to international investment and financial flows, and lower levels of international migration. In the 1970s and ‘80s, faced with straining government budgets, stagnating growth, inflation, and other economic problems, policymakers looked for a new paradigm.\n\nThe program they turned to is often called “neoliberalism,” and it is usually described as a governmental withdrawal from many fields of activity in favor of a revitalization of free-market thinking and an extension of the logic of decentralized coordination to ever more areas of life. The locus of political power began to shift from legislatures, which are easily gridlocked, to regulatory bodies, public–private partnerships, and independent central banks. Political life in the most powerful states was supra-nationalized in institutions like the European Union and the World Trade Organization to match the scale of these states’ power, while small states faced pressure to adopt the set of fiscal and trade policies that came to be known as the “Washington Consensus.” Between the 1970s and the 2000s, neoliberalism remade the global political economy and reshaped almost every society in the world.\n\nHowever, as Quinn Slobodian demonstrates in his 2018 book Globalists, when you descend from the theory to the practice of neoliberalism, the dominant action is not the removal or withdrawal of government interference but rather the imposition of new tools of governance to actively impede political interference, while making possible ever more fluid movements of labor, capital, and trade. His account of the Geneva School of neoliberalism traces the activities not only of thinkers like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman but of lesser-known actors like international lawyer Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann, who advised organizations like the U.N., the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Commission, and the World Trade Organization.\n\nRather than simply reducing the size and scope of government, neoliberalism invented new tools of governance. There was comparatively less emphasis on executive governance or legislative contestation. Instead, policymakers “set the agenda” through regulations, rulings, standards, ratings, and best practices defined by new metrics and reports. These changes would be issued not by diktat but in coordination with “stakeholders,” who were expected to be active participants in their own governance. Market and social actors would be set free from political control, in exchange for participating in new forms of political oversight to manage the tidal wave of dynamism.\n\nFor example, neoliberalism is often described as lowering barriers to global trade. But high tariff rates or protectionist quotas were far from the most important impediments to trade. The biggest barrier to trade was communication: the jumbled assortment of local rules, practices, and laws would-be merchants had to navigate. On the ground, lowering barriers to trade actually looked like creating shared protocols governing every part of the trading process: international air cargo handling (the Cargo Services Conference Resolutions), the size and shape of shipping containers (ISO 668), bills of lading (the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System), invoicing and accounting (International Financial Reporting Standards), and far more. Often, these were not even set or mandated by governments: international organizations and trade associations developed their own standards, maintained by technical committees and published for anyone to use.\n\nThe deregulatory agenda of political leaders like Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and Deng Xiaoping only cleared the way for neoliberalism’s real power: designing the world economic system for openness through shared protocols. When seen through this lens, it seems that larger forces even than the Reagan Revolution were at work.\n\nControl by Carrot\n\nAfter taking LSD in a Southern California desert in 1975, the French historian Michel Foucault developed a fascination with neoliberalism that has puzzled many as shockingly uncritical for a thinker who had made his name tearing off the masks that new forms of power used in order to conceal themselves throughout history. The kind of power that neoliberalism could wield seemed curiously invisible to him. He understood neoliberalism as a “technology of the environment” that incentivized people to behave in certain ways by shaping their economic situation. Compared to previous epochs of power, it was a “massive withdrawal with regard to the normative-disciplinary system.” As sociologist Daniel Zamora has put it, Foucault “understands neoliberalism not as the withdrawal of the state, but as the withdrawal of its techniques of subjection.”\n\nFoucault’s friend and contemporary Gilles Deleuze tried to put a finger on what Foucault was missing. In his “Postscript on the Societies of Control,” Deleuze identified the new mode of power that was growing in the West. The old disciplinary societies that had enclosed their wards in different systems — the school, the prison, the factory, the hospital, the army — were giving way to more flexible societies, what he called “societies of control.”\n\nIn this new kind of society, control mechanisms steer us gently at all times, acting not by pushing (the stick) but by pulling — bringing new information, new models, new desires to our attention (the carrot). Crucially, the new control society presents its power as choice. You are free to choose to do what you want; the system just provides you with information, and tracks (or surveils) your choices. In the words of philosopher Byung-Chul Han, it seeks “to please and fulfil, not to repress.” The core technologies of the disciplinary society, Deleuze explained, were for containing and releasing energy — think steam engines, railways, and factories. But in the control society, the core technology is the networked computer, which is for continuously gathering data and imposing control by numbers.\n\nWith this shift, our sense of self changed too. Deleuze compared the self of the disciplinary society to a mole, which burrows in and then makes itself comfortable within the bounds of the enclosures to which it is subjected. But in a control society, the self is more like a snake, an undulating project moving from one state to another, never quite at rest, always getting ready to shed its skin at the next stage of self-becoming.\n\nA Web of Our Own Making\n\nThe secret to how power operates today is that it looks like freedom. The control society uses data to build everyone a customized choice architecture in which the “rational” move, the “optimized” move, is always more: do more, work more, buy more, know more, scroll more, sleep more, relax more. The openness and positivity of the control society — giving you more choices, more options, more information, more efficiency — becomes a form of power.\n\nIt’s not obvious, but the secret sauce of the control society is the protocol. You would never be able to pull together all the data, make sense of it, and create the architecture of “more” in a centralized fashion. But open protocols allow information, desire, and everything else to flow to where it is needed. They allow all sorts of people to try all sorts of things. Many protocols fail, but the overall effect is to create a precise simulation of every social desire, “spontaneous order” not just for marketplaces but for everything. Like the Internet, in the control society there is something for everybody.\n\nHere is what I mean. Let’s say I’m streaming Agatha Christie’s Poirot and I become intrigued by a fountain pen wielded by Sir David Suchet’s dashing Belgian detective. From this first little nub of desire, I search Google to learn about the pen, finding a highly up-voted post on the r/ fountainpens sub-Reddit with more information and a link to an online pen store. When I click it, marketing tools like Meta Pixel flag my interest. Later, as I scroll Instagram, I start to see more posts featuring fountain pens, and I start following a few fountain pen influencer accounts. One day, I see a pen I love, and purchase it directly from a store, supplying my email address for a discount. The more I press on in this direction, the more fountain pen content — not just advertisements but posts, articles, memes, and so on — flow to me. None of this is “designed” by a Big Pen cartel: rather, open protocols connect a network of actors with their own goals and incentives — Redditors, pen obsessives, manufacturers, online pen shops, ad tech companies — that “spontaneously” hook in to and meet my desires. (It goes without saying that, beneath this example, there are thousands of technical protocols operating my web browser, Netflix, the payments system, the luxury pen supply chain, and so forth.)\n\nThe result is what philosopher Antón Barba-Kay describes, in the name of his 2023 book, as “a web of our own making.” Because all that the control society does is offer us choices — albeit ones optimized for our desires — we hold ourselves responsible for them, at a limbic level, even as we are increasingly surrounded by a super-stimulus system optimized to fulfill our desires. Deny it if you like, but the TikTok algorithm knows your inward thoughts. Nobody made you linger over that video. And whose fault is it if you DoorDash McDonald’s at midnight? Nobody made you do it. If you really wanted to you could abstain, just as if you really wanted to you could hit the StairMaster at the gym. Hopelessly scrolling through Instagram? No one is making you. No matter which direction you want to go in the network of desire, the choice is yours, and the protocol will help you plug in to the businesses, influencers, ideas, and communities that will meet your wants. And if you’re not happy with the existing market offerings? The protocol means that you and anyone else can make your own. The choice is yours.\n\nThis liquidity and openness also underlies neoliberalism’s paradoxical narrowness — that this world of radical choice results in convergence on the same ideas, platforms, aesthetics, and products. Margaret Thatcher’s slogan “There Is No Alternative” is the natural outworking of a system where the most optimized, the most popular, the most viral, the most efficient anything can be known with objective certainty. The global Airbnb aesthetic, the moneyball three-pointer, the Marvel movie, the paintings of The People’s Choice: these are not imposed by any cabal; they are the mathematical average of actualized desire, the calculable outworking of information flowing freely. They will be displaced not by some authentic vision, but merely by the next algorithmic average.\n\nThe networked computer imposes what the Thatcherites liked to call “market discipline” over everything: the ever-present possibility of users switching to a superior offering means that even monopolists can’t rest on the laurels of network effects for long. The only way for platforms to maintain their power, in the long run, is to anticipate and pre-emptively adapt to their competition. When TikTok builds its superior feed, every other social media platform must TikTok-ify itself or get left in the dust. Western Union finds itself competing not just against banks but against payment platforms, fintech startups, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nJeff Bezos gets credited for the line “your margin is my opportunity,” but this is really the protocol speaking. John Gilmore, an Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder and Internet protocol creator extraordinaire, once boasted that “The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.” Swap out “censorship” for “rentier profits,” “political correctness,” “outdated systems,” “good manners,” “boredom,” or any other barrier to efficiency or desire, and you get a sense of the shaping power of a protocol society.\n\nIII. The New Political Reality\n\n‘An Animated Swarm’\n\nHow do you wield power in the world of the protocol? The contours and stratagems of protocol power are in some cases so alien as to not register as a form of politics at all.\n\nThe exercise of power begins in the design of the protocol itself. Any protocol will strike a balance between breadth and depth, depending on the problem it is trying to solve and the stakeholders it is intended to serve. Who designs the protocol is often a contested question: some emerge almost organically from within a community (think of the rise of the hashtag), others from a technical committee of interested parties (like those of the World Wide Web Consortium), and some from a party that has designed a protocol from scratch and releases it to the world, seeking its broader adoption. In some cases, as with the videocassette format battle between Sony’s Betamax and JVC’s VHS, particular companies or actors serve to benefit from the adoption of one protocol over another.\n\nThe most powerful element of protocol design, though, is not this or that engineering choice but the winners and losers the protocol creates by its mere existence. Who is rendered “below the API” — that is, replaceable by automation? Who faces a glut of new competitors, or a glut of new customers? Who can organize or communicate that could not do so before? In the age of the protocol, groups attempt to protect their interests by controlling or even forbidding the construction of protocols that would harm them, or by building protocols that undermine their competitors. So, for instance, lawyers for Uber and Lyft helped to dismantle the regulations that sustained taxi guilds all over the world, but would never do anything to harm their own profession’s unique privileges.\n\nThe power of protocols comes from what economists call “network effects”: the more people use a protocol, the more valuable it becomes. When, almost as if by Darwinian selection, one protocol has emerged as the universal choice, it can be very difficult to move away from it. While many powerful forces may work to establish protocols beneficial to their interests, these network effects are not the product of a decision. They come from the incentives that everyone faces, as a stone is held in place by its own weight.\n\nWe usually think about this effect in terms of the scale of a network, but every network in fact has a particular structure, and these structures tend to be highly sticky. Path dependency means that those who win early win more. The difference between Detroit and Cleveland in American automotive manufacturing, or between Palo Alto and Pasadena in high-tech electronics, emerged from a small number of early advantages that slightly inclined the playing field in one direction over the other.\n\nWhatever their cause — early adoption, favor by an algorithm — one of the emergent properties of a protocol is that it will bless some and not others with network centrality. Some will become uniquely connected or uniquely well-positioned, often in a manner subtle or even invisible to outsiders.\n\nTo early Internet thinkers like Kevin Kelly and Manuel Castells, the distinctive political formation the network made possible was the “swarm” or the “crowd.” This kind of decentralized, emergent coordination is characteristic of open systems in which the independent incentives each individual faces can lead to unexpected synchronicities, or focal points toward which everything suddenly rushes in, often overwhelmingly so. “Going viral” is functionally the same as experiencing a distributed denial of service attack. Color revolutions, fashion fads, flash mobs, meme stocks, and moral panics all have the same structure. The bigger the network, the more open the structure, the more potential a protocol has to generate a swarm. As Kelly wrote, “An animated swarm is reticulating the surface of the planet. We are clothing the globe with a network society.” (Or, in the words of Marc Andreessen, “software is eating the world.”)\n\nThe most important feature of the swarm is what it is not: it is not a “we,” a movement or a community that one joins. Its constituent members may not even be aware that they are acting collectively and may have quite different incentives and goals. If anything, the swarm seems to have an alien will, a collective direction that may be quite at odds with the beliefs and desires of any individual within it — literary theorist René Girard identified the swarm with the Satanic.\n\nAt the same time, most swarms are not truly leaderless. In Girard’s analysis of scapegoating in I See Satan Fall Like Lightning, he fixates on the story of Apollonius of Tyana targeting a beggar. The magic of Apollonius’ action is in goading and prodding the right people behind the scenes to create the cascade of emotions and actions that generates a stoning mob. We see the same thing at work in “cancellations” today — powerful influencers at the periphery who have mastered the art of generating and directing the swarm.\n\nMany protocols are not totally decentralized or voluntary. They may rely on some discrete platform to provide fundamental infrastructure, whether it is software that makes the protocol accessible as a service, like Twitter or Uber, or something more foundational, like the Internet service providers that actually connect users to the Internet.\n\nPlatforms have a unique ability to exert power over the protocol using artificial limits. They can ban users, block payments, censor posts, blacklist IP addresses, halt shipments, or otherwise impose restraints not found in the protocols themselves.\n\nThe most powerful example is what political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman have dubbed “weaponized interdependence”: the ability of sovereign states to leverage control over key chokepoints in global networks to exclude adversaries and protect their interests. The United States, for instance, uses its powerful control over banking protocols like SWIFT and critical technology in the global supply chain to levy sanctions on Russia and hamper Chinese GPU development.\n\nCarl Schmitt’s famous dictum that “Sovereign is he who decides on the exception” gains a new meaning in the age of the protocol. Unlike other kinds of protocol power, platform sovereignty is nakedly political, one of the reasons why many of the criticisms of Big Tech companies focus on their abuse of this power.\n\nThat said, there is no free lunch. Some protocols — think Bitcoin or BitTorrent — are designed to escape command. And the network interprets coercion as damage and routes around it: as platforms abuse their power, the network calls forth alternatives, workarounds, and new protocols to escape their control.\n\nThe Ghost in the Machine\n\nPublic discourse has fixated on the rare and ineffectual exercises of platform sovereignty — who is banned, which posts are censored, which countries are sanctioned — because in the age of the protocol they are the only exercises of power still familiar to us.\n\nIn every other regard, we find ourselves bewildered. If politics is about the question “who decides,” protocols are profoundly anti-political. No one decides. No one is in charge. At the same time that every individual faces more choice, more freedom, more optionality, we find ourselves in a society characterized by no agency, no accountability, no center, no one to hold responsible.\n\nIn his new book The Unaccountability Machine, Dan Davies describes the emergence of “accountability sinks” in complex systems, where a decision is ineffably delegated to a policy or a computer system such that no human appears responsible or “in charge.” But while some of the systems Davies examines are the result of bad design or even a malicious attempt to avoid responsibility, in the age of protocols we can also expect accountability sinks to develop automatically, as an emergent phenomenon. When it is no one’s duty to take care of the whole, no one can be held responsible for what falls through the cracks.\n\nThings are supposed to work. And if they don’t, whose fault is that? Everywhere, the political shall has been replaced by the economic should.\n\nHigh demand from riders should get more ride-share drivers out on a Friday night. Draconian Covid policies in China should get entrepreneurs in Vietnam and Thailand to set up alternative supply chains. Your Bluetooth headset should automatically connect to your laptop. Your DoorDash delivery should be placed, complete and intact, on your doorstep.\n\nBut when these outcomes fail to materialize, who exactly is to blame? Whose job, exactly, is it to remedy the situation? And the more decentralized and scalable, the more disintermediated the protocol is, the more agency and responsibility evaporate into the ether. In a decentralized system, agency becomes invisible. And as complexity grows, a system totally transparent in its processes becomes totally opaque in its governance. Because the process rules, power flows to those who have mastered it: those who know the process, who can change the process, who can create an exception to the process, who can direct the attention of the process.\n\nThis is why we suspect that those who most loudly proclaim they are “following the science,” “following the process,” or “following the markets” are actually engaged in elaborate forms of ventriloquy. We can sense that power is operating. We believe we can tell when we are being disadvantaged and others advantaged. We believe we can sense — in the direction of the swarm, in the outputs of the algorithm, in when the protocol does or does not deliver the goods — some hidden hand, some force behind the scene. We experience growing paranoia about manipulation, and the growing reality of manipulation, in almost no relation to each other. We know that nothing that channels so much power and wealth, on which so much depends, can ever escape politics. But we cannot glimpse the operations of power: the protocol demands that the most effective exercises of power are the most invisible.\n\nProtocol politics is fundamentally characterized by acephalousness — no head, no agency, no accountability. And yet we feel the ghost in the machine, the power that shapes the contours of our lives, even as we can almost never pin it down. As recounted in the last entry in this essay series, “An America of Secrets” [Summer 2023], we occasionally catch power after the fact thanks to transparency laws or government leaks. These serve not to bolster the legitimacy of the protocol but to make us wonder about all the things we missed.\n\nWoke Dreampolitik\n\nParanoia induced by our increasingly formless experience of power is a key factor driving dreampolitik in the United States. That it takes different forms on the American left and right owes largely to a difference in how each encounters the power of the protocol, leading to what Matt Yglesias has dubbed “The Crank Realignment”: anti-establishment conspiracy theorists have migrated from the left to the right over the past two decades.\n\nOver the past two decades or so, the American left has become increasingly dominated by the Professional Managerial Class of college-educated, white-collar workers. This class vanguard understands far better than any on the right how to work the protocol levers of modern society. They know how to make adjustments deep in the infrastructural underbelly of modern organizations.\n\nIt is the failure of these methods to solve society’s ills that is now generating a crisis of faith and a search for new approaches among policy elites, and an attendant zealous cult among activists and die-hards that wants to double down on the protocol society. In areas as disparate as primary school education outcomes, working-class life expectancy, criminal justice, and trade liberalization, much-hyped reforms to antiquated government programs or policies — think Obamacare, NAFTA, or Arne Duncan’s education programs — failed to turn things around or created new problems. Progressive believers need a scapegoat for the failure of protocol governance to deliver the goods. They have found one in “systemic racism” and other systemic -isms, which are the social equivalent of the “systemic risk” that had nearly destroyed the global financial system. In both cases, a complex web of unacknowledged problems, policies with hidden risks, inadequate metrics, and short-sighted leaders had created an institutional crisis whose boundaries were everywhere and nowhere. The progressive ideology that some have labeled “wokeness” is really the protocol society trying to save itself from itself by radically doubling down on the left’s preferred tools of governance.\n\nNot only does wokeness not threaten the status quo — it promises to patch the holes that status quo institutions have already been seeing. It is no coincidence that the biggest institutional boosters of wokeness were also the most stalwart advocates for the shift toward neoliberal governance: the Ford Foundation, the Open Society Foundations, technology and media companies, Fortune 500 corporations, large financial institutions, and the European Union. Their legitimacy and power have been greatly enhanced by the neoliberal turn and they would very much like to keep the status quo in place. They are perfectly happy to invest resources in fixing it.\n\nThis is why wokeness as a practice looks a lot like more protocol governance: a proliferation of regulations, metrics, scorecards, ratings, accreditations, standards, best practices, and all of the attendant compliance jobs. A woke Millennial banker might return from a mid-afternoon self-care break or a privilege-decentering mindfulness exercise to prepare a PowerPoint on Dodd–Frank compliance obligations for financial risk management standardization.\n\nIf these techniques have failed, progressives believe, it is only because they were not applied deeply enough. “Doing the work” means instantiating standards and best practices — of racial justice, sexual non-discrimination, and more — not in process, behavior, or policy but in one’s own soul.\n\nQ Dreampolitik\n\nIn contrast to the managerial classes, the denizens of Middle America know exactly what has happened to them: the American way of life has been hollowed out. And they know exactly who is to blame: the coastal elite. But they have no idea how this has happened. For the American losers of globalization, a theory like QAnon provides a factually distorted but spiritually true fable of the conflict shaping their lives. It is current history through the funhouse mirror of a Hollywood thriller.\n\nQAnon and similar conspiracy theories have proven most attractive to the small-business bourgeoisie and the heartland working class. In American life, they have been the losers of neoliberalism and globalization. Where the small-business bourgeoisie once benefited from artificially lower costs and a large and growing market, they increasingly find themselves squeezed by international competitors on one hand and concentrated monopolies on the other, all while the administrative state continually seeks to roll back the size exemptions in regulations that had once provided a moat against Big Business. The shift in wealth and power toward large cities has also taken jobs and dynamism from exurban and small city areas where the heartland working class engaged in manufacturing, agriculture, energy, retail distribution, and warehousing. Regardless of their personal economic circumstances, the small-business class and working class are likelier to live in parts of the country whose life chances are ebbing away, and to count in their immediate social networks victims of offshoring, drug abuse, or war.\n\nWhy is the right today more susceptible to conspiratorial thinking? It has nothing to do with a so-called authoritarian personality or any other microwaved mid-century psychobabble. Loneliness is growing fastest among the groups that constitute the Republican base, including rural people, older people, residents of post-industrial areas, and low-education whites. Their life expectancy is dropping, and deaths from despair are on the rise. The Republican Party today is the party of the America that is being gradually destroyed. As Nicolas Guilhot put it in a Boston Review essay on the social sources of QAnon, “the proliferation of conspiracy theories reflects the dismal poverty of a political culture that fails millions of individuals confronted with the loss of their world.”\n\nLike any colonial subject, Middle Americans have a keen sense of who has stolen their country from them. But the citizens of “flyover country” are hostile to, and proudly ignorant of, the work-ways of the Professional Managerial Class. Even the elite of the “small business bourgeoisie,” while they may be worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, tend to operate in the business sectors whose models have been least overtaken by protocol governance at the level of the firm: energy, construction, logistics, manufacturing, and real estate. Many of them made their fortunes from the destruction of the prior New Deal regulatory regime, but they did not understand that they would have to pay the piper as political and social demands for control emerged in a new key. Middle Americans have lost any feel for the new grammar of power — indeed, that is how they got into this situation in the first place.\n\nAs a result, those truly responsible for the hollowing out of America are completely obscure to their victims. QAnon and other conspiracy theories, such as birtherism, emerged out of right-wing populism in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008. That crisis and its aftermath is a critical moment in the origin stories of Steve Bannon and other key influencers of the right-wing conspiracy metaverse. And so it is useful to consider the Tea Party’s diagnosis at the time. Right-wing populists understood that something had gone very wrong with the American constitutional republic but evinced no serious engagement with how power operates today. The complex problems of the financial, real estate, and health care sectors, all against the backdrop of global financial and trade flows, were reduced to a caricatured platform focusing on the constitutionality of laws and on lowering taxes. Many Tea Party proposals called for restrictions on legislative activities that had long gone extinct in practice, and completely ignored the displacement of power to outside the public sector. In 2012, Mitt Romney was hurt by his association with the “big bankers” and “Wall Street types” who had sought a bailout, but there was no sense that his critics on the right actually understood how a company like Bain Capital had operated or why it might be bad for America. Popular right-wing politics in America has almost become defined by its ignorance of how power and money operate today.\n\nBewildered by the layers of bureaucratic decision-making and professional standards-setting that end up imposing gender ideology in schools or replacing good, stable jobs with gig-economy wages, the right has resorted to a kind of kabuki-theater version of the story. The only thing more difficult to accept than that your way of life is being destroyed by insidious, malicious forces bent on destroying you is that your way of life is being destroyed entirely as a byproduct of impersonal global forces that are completely indifferent to the suffering they cause, perfectly willing to rip apart communities and families for increasing marginal profit. The result is a surrealist dream-state fantasy projection by which threatened Middle Americans work out the real intuitions infringing on their subconscious.\n\nQAnon is what you would get if you gave a mediocre Hollywood screenwriter a theme — the destruction of the American way of life by a corrupt elite — and asked him to fill in the details. In contrast to the central figures of true conspiracies, who are almost always hidden deep in the bowels of a bureaucracy or network, the central figures of distorted conspiracy theories are almost always notable to start with. Q-type conspiracy theories take decisions that are largely made by countless grant-writers, management consultants, tax lawyers, and nonprofit executives and attribute them to Bill Gates or George Soros.\n\nAnd yet, the most important polarity in American politics in the future will not be between Democrats and Republicans, or even the Professional Managerial Class and Middle America. Because the protocol is where power resides, the struggle that is only now beginning to emerge will be between two protocol elites: the managerial protocol elite of regulation and the technological protocol elite of computer code.\n\nThough it may not be fully understood for many years, the advent of large language models now makes a clash of titans inevitable.\n\nFor the managerial elite, LLMs promise the ability to standardize and regulate with an automation and precision that was impossible before, using engineered prompts to finally scale regulation and platform governance to match the decentralized scale of the underlying technical protocols. Moreover, if AI regulations lead to a monopoly or oligopoly of foundational AI models, it would rebuild Internet civilization in the model of the mainframe computer: hub-and-spoke, centralized, controllable.\n\nFor the technological elite, by contrast, LLMs, along with technologies like Web3, promise the ability to free protocols from the only remaining constraint upon them: the need for a human programmer to make the connections between one protocol and another. Text-based protocols — popularized in the early World Wide Web era to make it easier for humans to build for the Internet — now make it trivially easy for LLMs to automatically translate across protocols or build new ones on the fly (like the ones interspersed in this essay). The only thing standing in the way are the management elites and their regulation-based protocols. AI seems like it could automate a lot of what they do too. Political contestation in the future will look a lot like a struggle over which protocols will win out.\n\nAfter the Protocol\n\nSome of the oldest Internet communities were formed on Usenet, or User’s Network, a distributed discussion system of protocols for generating, storing, and retrieving news articles and posts that launched in 1980. Many of the concepts and practices of contemporary Internet culture originated on Usenet. On top of the protocols that ran the servers, early netizens developed protocols of the older sort: shared terms, interests, conversations, etiquette — in short, a shared culture. That was, until the Eternal September.\n\nEvery September, users would complain about the flood of newbies on Usenet who had gained access to the Internet for the first time, as college freshmen. Until they absorbed Usenet’s culture, they were a nuisance. But in 1993, America Online debuted direct access to Usenet for its customers, and wave after wave of newbs overwhelmed Usenet groups. Usenet’s culture never really recovered, giving rise to the idea of an eternal September.\n\nThe scaling power of the protocol tends to flatten anything human in the direction of what the protocol makes possible. The Eternal September marches on, billions of Internet users soon to be matched by trillions of Internet-connected devices and AI agents.\n\nFrom the postwar years until the 2010s, Western elites heralded the power of globalization to usher in a new age of human flourishing. But around 2016, they began to realize that the protocols they had built had leached power away from the traditional institutions from which they derived their power. Ever since, elites have been attempting to regain control through lockdowns — of borders, of cryptocurrencies, of misinformation — in a last-ditch attempt to reimpose the logic of the centralized mainframe over the world of networked computers. Absent the kind of totalitarian power the Chinese Communist Party exerts, efforts like the Department of Homeland Security’s Disinformation Governance Board seem doomed to not only fail but immediately backfire.\n\nWe have to live here now, in the world built out of protocols. We have to build new habits, new institutions, and new ideas to make sense of it. After the beginning of the Eternal September in 1993, recovering Internet culture meant retreating to more felicitous protocols, like forums and blogs. We face the same challenge on a civilizational scale.\n\nThe Internet writer Realityspammer sees the potential we are being forced toward: “Is culture truly and irreversibly stuck? No, there are all kinds of opportunities and resources for those with the vision to create new memetico-political assemblages” — new ways for people to model their actions for each other, new patterns of coordination, new habits, new ways of organizing culture — “but it cannot be done through aping the old means.”\n\nIn the same way that the industrial age called forth a political science of management, we need a political science for the age of the protocol. We need to conceptualize new ways of asserting agency, new ways of finding both “exit” and “voice” in malfunctioning systems, ways of embedding protocols in the kinds of human communities that can generate legitimacy and accountability, ways of fighting the complexity and obscurity that can hide the exercise of power.\n\nAnd we need to reclaim the paradoxical freedom of irrationality and self-limitation. In a protocol society, to default to responding rationally to incentives is to default to the swarm, to enslaving desire and burnout-inducing freedom. Deleuze argues that our age demands that we cultivate a new form of idiot savant, who can turn “the absurd into the highest power of thought.” In the era of GPS, there is no longer a road less traveled by, no shortcut known only to locals, no path that is your secret. To see something new, one must find what is not on the map, the absurd traversal across a roof or through an unlocked window. Or one must find new paths in time instead of space, refusing to optimize by claiming some place, artifact, or community as one’s own, the same way that a romantic relationship becomes something more when both partners refuse to look for a better one.\n\nMake virtues of irrational attachment, cultivated ignorance, and stubborn loyalty. The day belongs to those who master the new tools for building, but who preserve in their hearts a secret garden of earnest loves untrammeled by the swarm. ♥\n\nReality: A Post-Mortem\n\n← Essay 5. An America of Secrets\n\nEssay 7 is coming soon in a future issue. →"}

John (J.R. Snotly Builds), an AFOL from Utah, just started sharing their LEGO creations a few weeks ago, and already they’re a force to be reckoned with. The builder’s style is based on embracing minifig scale while preserving maximum detail. That means Star Wars vehicles that are decidedly smaller than most official sets, but look perfectly proportioned next to a minifig. This Snowspeeder is barely 12 studs long and can still seat 2!\n\nBy working at this scale, John makes ships that we’ve seen in LEGO hundreds of times feel fresh again, using surprising parts and connections to solve familiar build challenges in new ways. Take, for example, the engine cones on this N-1 Starfigher made from Castle helmets!\n\nPurists might note that the windscreen used on the A-Wing and N-1 isn’t a LEGO part, as the builder found that the WANGE windscreen was better for keeping a minifig pilot enclosed at this scale. John also has a version with a LEGO alternative.\n\nWhat an exciting debut, and perfectly timed for Star Wars Day.\n\nRelated"}

Arne Slot’s side wrapped up the trophy with four games to spare following a 5-1 rout of Tottenham at Anfield last weekend.\n\nWith silverware secured and the pressure lifted, the focus now turns to managing minutes, assessing squad depth, and building momentum towards next season. Slot has already confirmed that rotation is on the agenda for Sunday’s trip to face Chelsea.\n\n“My lineups will be different to what we’ve had the last 10 months, (we) won’t change everyone but there will be some rotation. Not to say we will lose, we have a lot of trust in those (players),” he said.\n\n“I think some of the players deserved to play earlier because they have trained so well and are good enough, but I mainly chose the same players so I see where they are looking ahead to next season a bit, but also because they deserve to play this season.”\n\nYoung talents set for chances\n\nAmong those pushing for more involvement is Harvey Elliott, who has impressed with his attitude and application, but has been limited to substitute appearances in recent months. Slot will also be weighing up whether to hand summer signing Federico Chiesa a rare start. The Italian forward has featured sparingly, but with the title sewn up, there’s an opportunity for him to make his mark.\n\nSupporters are eager to see both players given a platform to prove they can be part of the long-term picture at Anfield. Slot appears ready to oblige, though it’s clear changes will be measured rather than wholesale.\n\nDefensive options boosted by Bradley return\n\nConor Bradley is back in training and in contention after missing the win over Spurs with a minor knock sustained in training. The Northern Ireland international, who only recently returned from a hamstring injury, has impressed since breaking into the first team this season and could be on the bench at Stamford Bridge.\n\n“He will train with us today, so that’s the first start and let’s see how he does,” Slot said on Friday.\n\n“We expect him to be available. I don’t know if that means that he is available to start, but if all goes well today and tomorrow he will probably be in the squad, yeah.”\n\nHis availability offers further flexibility to Slot, especially with Trent Alexander-Arnold back fit and delivering a solid performance against Tottenham.\n\nJoe Gomez remains Liverpool’s only confirmed absentee, as he continues his recovery from hamstring surgery.\n\nMidfield and attacking changes likely\n\nThe midfield is another area where Slot has options. Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Elliott are all in line for starts, while Ryan Gravenberch could also retain his place after a tidy showing last time out.\n\nUp front, Mohamed Salah is expected to feature once again, though there will be competition between Diogo Jota and Darwin Núñez for a central striking role. Chiesa’s inclusion would likely see him start on the left, with Salah operating from his usual right-sided berth.\n\nAlisson is likely to continue in goal, with Caoimhín Kelleher ready if needed. Kostas Tsimikas and Jarell Quansah will also be considered in defence as Slot balances game time with keeping key personnel sharp.\n\nPredicted Liverpool XI:\n\nAlisson; Alexander-Arnold, Quansah, Van Dijk, Tsimikas; Gravenberch, Elliott, Jones; Salah, Chiesa, Jota\n\nThere may be no title at stake on Sunday, but the trip to west London still matters. For several Liverpool players, it could be a chance to shape their futures at the club."}

Despite a respected legacy and silverware in recent seasons, a disappointing campaign has pushed the Italian closer to the exit door.\n\nDefeat to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final, a growing gap in the La Liga title race, and an embarrassing Champions League collapse against Arsenal have left his position untenable. Ancelotti is expected to move into international management, with Brazil ready to welcome him as their new head coach.\n\nAttention now turns to his successor. Bayer Leverkusen’s Xabi Alonso has emerged as the overwhelming favourite to take the job, with the former Madrid and Liverpool midfielder admired for his work in Germany and his deep ties to the club’s culture.\n\nKlopp’s Name Resurfaces – But Timing Is Key\n\nIn recent weeks, there’s been persistent speculation over whether Jürgen Klopp could be a contender for the Madrid role. The former Liverpool manager stepped down from Anfield at the end of the 2023/24 season, citing the need for rest after a highly demanding period in charge.\n\nHe currently serves as Head of Global Soccer at Red Bull, where he is said to be immersed in long-term strategy and overseeing structural football development across the group’s clubs. However, some reports have hinted that he may be feeling the strain in the role.\n\nFabrizio Romano addressed those claims in his latest YouTube update:\n\n“I keep receiving many questions on Jurgen Klopp. I was checking on this story for weeks because we had this rumour for a long time. But what I got on this story on Jurgen Klopp is there is some people at Real Madrid having a high opinion of Klopp, really appreciating Klopp.”\n\nRomano went on to say that no talks have taken place between Klopp and Madrid, adding:\n\n“At the moment I’m not aware of anything advanced, also because the agent of Klopp has already gone public and clarified how happy he is at Red Bull.”\n\nActive Role at Red Bull Reinforces Klopp’s Commitment\n\nIt’s clear Klopp hasn’t taken a backseat in his new post. Romano revealed that he’s been directly involved in ongoing projects within the Red Bull network, including discussions around the coaching vacancy at RB Leipzig:\n\n“I’m told Klopp had direct contact with [Como manager] Cesc Fabregas a few weeks ago to speak about the Leipzig project.”\n\nFabregas is reportedly still deciding his future, but Klopp’s involvement shows that he remains hands-on and invested in Red Bull’s direction.\n\nMadrid’s Focus Remains on Alonso\n\nFor all the admiration Madrid may hold for Klopp, their focus remains firmly on Xabi Alonso. Romano was clear on the matter:\n\n“Real Madrid still believe Alonso is option number one, two and three to become the new head coach.”\n\nWhile Alonso remains under contract at Leverkusen, few believe a move to Madrid would be problematic once the season concludes. Barring any major change, Alonso’s return to the Bernabéu appears a matter of time.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a Liverpool perspective, this story stirs mixed feelings. There’s no denying the pride in seeing Klopp’s name still linked to elite clubs. His status in the game is unquestioned. But after a heartfelt farewell, few would have expected his name to re-emerge in the frame for such a high-pressure job so soon.\n\nHis involvement in Red Bull’s strategic direction proves that he hasn’t drifted far from the game, and for Liverpool fans, that might be both reassuring and unsettling. While there’s no suggestion of an imminent return to management, the sense that Klopp might still crave the day-to-day rhythm of coaching lingers.\n\nWould Real Madrid be a temptation? Of course. But Klopp has always chosen projects that fit him on a deeper level. The timing doesn’t appear right, and the challenge doesn’t carry the emotional resonance that Liverpool did. Still, it’s a reminder that football moves fast—and so, perhaps, does Klopp’s desire to stay away from the dugout."}

AIエージェント型ツールは負の遺産の解消に利用するのが良い\n\n当社ではDevinを導入して幾つかのタスクを切り出して取り組んでいます。\n\n結果としてわかったのは実装までの過程や流れがわりとブラックボックスになることが多く、妥当性の判断が難しいということでした。\n\nSlackでの指示からGitHubのPRまで一気通貫で進めてくれる近未来感は非常に好きなのですが、限られた時間で判断を下すのがかなり難しいとわかりました。\n\n最近ではリファクタリングやドキュメント更新漏れへの対応など未来において負の遺産になりそうなタスクを取り組んでもらうことが最適なのではと考えており、そうしたタスクを渡すようにしています。\n\n今後もwikiや品質担保系（テストなど）を中心にプロジェクト品質の底上げに対して利用する形で取り組もうと思っています。そのため現在では下記のようなチーム体制を目論んでいます。\n\n9. 組織の規模のスケールが難しすぎる\n\n2024年から構築したAI駆動開発の組織ですが、案件の受注も伸びていたこともあり体制を増強していったのですが、困ったことに体制が大きくなればなるほどAI駆動開発の良さが失われていきました。\n\nなぜかというと、AI駆動開発の方法論が一般化していないこともあり、スケールする際にジョインしてもらう業務委託のメンバーの方にまでAI駆動開発のノウハウをキャッチアップしてもらう時間的な余裕すらなかったからです。\n\nそのため組織規模が大きくなった結果、AI駆動開発組織から従来型の開発組織に近づいていきました。\n\n僕にとってこの壁は途轍もなく高い壁として立ちはだっていたのですが、最近やっと打破する方法を思いついて取り組んでいる最中です。ここはまた記事にして出せればと思っています。\n\nとはいえAI駆動開発のパワーのおかげでここまで楽しく走ってくることができたので挑戦し続けたいと思います。\n\nおわりに\n\n思いつくままに 9つの学び を列挙してみました。\n\nAI駆動開発は非常に未来の可能性を感じさせる素晴らしいものです。\n\nしかしいざ組織導入しようと思うと想像以上の壁や難しさも訪れます。\n\n大事なのは「学ぶことや変えることを厭わず、愚直に進み続けること」です。\n\nぜひ皆さんの参考になると嬉しいです！\n\n普段はXでAI駆動開発の組織論などについて語っているのでぜひ未フォローの方はフォローしてもらえると嬉しいです！また『クマイ総研』というAI駆動開発のコミュニティ運営もしています。月に2～3日しか募集していないのですが気になる方がいればぜひチェックを！\n\nではでは、皆さんの貴重なお時間でお付き合い頂きありがとうございました！\n\nクマイでした～"}

We’ll show you all the ways you can enjoy the bounty.\n\nYou can access the Roku Channel via a web browser or via Roku’s mobile apps for Android and iOS. To watch on a smart TV or another brand of streaming device (an Amazon Fire TV, Google TV, Samsung smart TV), you’ll need to install the Roku Channel app from that device’s app store.\n\nUnfortunately, Roku doesn’t have a version of the Roku Channel app for LG smart TVs or the Apple TV streamer. But we’ll show you some workarounds for those platforms later.\n\nIf you do want a Roku streamer, we’ll help you find the right one.\n\nYou don’t need a Roku-powered streaming device or TV to watch the free entertainment on the Roku Channel; in fact, you don’t need a media streamer at all. Just point your web browser to theRokuChannel.com and pick what you want to watch. Michael Brown/Foundry\n\nWhat’s available on the Roku Channel?\n\nThe Roku Channel offers a wide array of FAST (free ad-supported TV) channels, movies and TV series you can watch on demand, as well as live linear TV (movies and shows are streamed on a fixed schedule—as in the good ol’ days of broadcast television—but you can drop in whenever you want).\n\nYou’ll find some of this same content on other FAST services, such as Pluto and Tubi, but Roku always has a selection of popular films and shows that are exclusive to the Roku Channel. Roku’s most high-profile original project so far is the Emmy-winning Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, starring Daniel Radcliffe as the satirical singer.\n\nRoku offers a small amount of its own original programming, including Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, starring Daniel Radcliffe. Jared Newman / Foundry\n\nOther original shows include The Great American Baking Show, Honest Renovations, and Visionaries: The Arch Project with Keanu Reeves. It’s a tiny catalog when compared to what’s streaming on Max or Netflix, but you can watch all these shows for free (with ads).\n\nRoku has also gone bargain hunting, picking up worthy projects other streaming services have dropped. That includes the entire library of Quibi, the failed “quick bites” short form video service that Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg (former chief executive of Disney and co-founder of Dreamworks), designed for phones.\n\nRoku rescued an entire library of Quibi shows like Die Hart with Kevin Hart, Most Dangerous Game, a Punk’d revival with Chance the Rapper, the Reno 911! revival, and Bill Burr Presents Immoral Compass. Roku also picked up The Spiderwick Chronicles TV series from Disney+.\n\nRoku acquired the entire Quibi library of short films and offers it for free on the Roku Channel. Quibi\n\nSince The Roku Channel was designed as a hub for Roku streaming devices, there’s a lot of emphasis on luring users to subscribe to other streaming services, such as Prime Video, Peacock, MGM+, and Paramount+. If you’re not familiar with the catalogs of those streaming services, you might find yourself routed to their apps or websites when you click on a title.\n\nIf you are interested in subscribing to those services, it’s best to sign up for them directly, so that your customer relationship is with the service provider and not a go-between.\n\nHow to use a browser to watch the Roku Channel\n\nFirst, point your browser to therokuchannel.com. You’ll see a large grid with thumbnail images of the movies and TV shows on offer. At the risk of contradicting everything I’ve said about this entertainment being free and ad supported; well, some of it—a little of it—isn’t. But the Roku Channel user interface makes it easy to tell the difference.Roku’s browser view makes it easy to identify which content is free with ads and which requires a subscription to one service or another. Each section features tiles that slide to the left or right with arrows on each side of the screen, much like the navigation on Netflix.\n\nYou’ll need to scroll down three times to see the entire user interface when viewing the Roku Channel in a web browser on an iPhone. Michael Brown/Foundry\n\nWhat you can’t do is adjust the view of the page to hide the Premium Subscription content. That makes sense—for Roku, at least—because part of the company’s business model revolves around you subscribing to outside services from within its site, for which Roku collects a commission. But it would be nice if users could hide the subscription options they don’t plan to use.\n\nA Browse tab allows a viewer to focus on such categories as Roku Originals, Movies, Series, Comedy, Drama, Western, and dozens of others. You can click a + button next to a program’s description to add it to a Saved tab.\n\nThe Live TV tab shows what’s streaming now with the same sliding tile interface the rest of The Roku Channel site uses. It’s a bit counterintuitive for anyone who grew up with the traditional cable guide grid interface that Pluto and Tubi use for their live TV offerings.\n\nHow to use the Roku Channel mobile app\n\nThe Roku Channel lives inside the Roku app for iOS and Android. That app is primarily designed to act as a remote for a Roku device or Roku-powered television, so you’ll need to get used to working around that capability if you’re primarily using the app to just watch the Roku Channel.\n\nThere is no Roku Channel app for the Apple TV streaming box, but you can play the service on your phone and cast it to the box connected your big-screen TV via Apple AirPlay. Michael Brown/Foundry\n\nFor example, I use an Apple TV streamer with a TCL television that happens to have the Roku software built in. I don’t use the Roku software on the television, but I do have a Roku account. Press the wrong icon on the screen, and the Roku interface launches on the TV screen. There’s no way to turn that off or eliminate the icons for apps you may have installed on a Roku device or television.\n\nThe mobile app uses the same sliding tile interface as the web version, but it’s far more difficult to use on a smaller screen. There’s no way to get an overview of what’s streaming live, and it’s impossible to surface a list of Roku Originals if you’re looking to focus on movies and shows exclusive to the channel.\n\nIf you own an Apple TV, you can watch The Roku Channel on your television screen via mirroring. There’s no support for AirPlay. That means you won’t have access to anything but the streaming video when watching.\n\nWhat’s the best way to watch the Roku Channel?\n\nIf have a Google-, Amazon Fire- or Roku-powered streaming device or television, download the Roku Channel app for your respective device, as that’s the easiest way to watch the service, as you’ll be able to use a remote control. If you don’t have one of those devices, the easiest way to watch the Roku Channel is on a web browser on a computer or tablet.\n\nIf you’re looking to use your mobile device and want to have access to the full catalog of movies and shows, your best bet is to log in via a web browser and add what you want to your Save List. That content will then be easily accessed on the mobile app.\n\nFree streaming has become a major player in home entertainment. If you’re willing to put up with a few commercials (and sometimes the same commercials playing during every single ad break), there’s a wide variety of classic and relatively new movies and shows available on the Roku Channel—and other FAST services—to pass the time."}

His quiet restraint on Monday – driven by wife Mirjam’s birthday lunch and parenting duties – spoke volumes of the man now tasked with sustaining Liverpool’s new golden era.\n\nSlot returned to a “day off” that featured neither relaxation nor idleness. A trip to Anfield, a snapshot with his right-hand man Sipke Hulshoff beside the freshly updated “20” tunnel sign, and a steady stream of calls – including from Jurgen Klopp and old friends back in the Netherlands – painted a picture of a grounded yet ambitious leader.\n\nSlot’s attitude sets a tone. “He is now one of the very elite coaches in world football but is a humble chap who never forgets his roots and replied to every congratulatory message he received this week.” Such details, as reported by Lewis Steele in The Daily Mail, illuminate a man quietly gearing up to build a dynasty, not just bask in a single glorious campaign.\n\nSuccess Breeds Attraction for Top Talent\n\nSlot understands the weight of celebration. “Life is not worth living if you do not celebrate the highs,” he insists, reinforcing a culture of appreciation as much as ambition. But beyond champagne-soaked locker rooms lies the strategic edge: success attracts.\n\nThis title, Slot says, gives him “the why” in selling Liverpool’s vision to current and future players. “It helps to attract new players as the ones we want, we are not the only club who think they are good. This helps them to see that the way we do things over here is special.”\n\nSlot’s approach is psychological as much as tactical. While others scramble for deals, Liverpool lean into prestige and structure. The parade and platform become tools in a larger sales pitch: come and join a winning project – one that values joy as much as it demands excellence.\n\nBuilding the Squad for Title Defence\n\nWhile reports link Liverpool with over 30 players this summer, it’s clear that the wishlist is far more targeted. “Mail Sport understands, though, that at least one forward and a new left back are the priorities.”\n\nAlisson Becker’s succession planning is already underway despite his contract clause that could extend his stay until 2027. Georgia’s Giorgi Mamardashvili is poised to arrive from Valencia for £25m plus add-ons. For Andy Robertson’s position, Liverpool are exploring moves for Milos Kerkez of Bournemouth and Ajax’s Jorrel Hato – both young and dynamic options, though Kerkez could cost up to £45m.\n\nShould Trent Alexander-Arnold complete an expected move to Real Madrid, the Reds could also dip into the market for a right back and central defender. Bournemouth’s Dean Huijsen and Antoine Semenyo have caught the eye, though Huijsen’s £50m release clause is a potential hurdle.\n\nSlot and sporting director Richard Hughes are overseeing a targeted rebuild, not a scattergun spree. Their scouting mission includes visits to RB Leipzig – with Xavi Simons and Benjamin Sesko on the radar – and trips to Real Betis and River Plate. This is a truly global operation.\n\nUp front, with Darwin Núñez likely to exit and Luis Díaz angling for a new deal, the forward line is under scrutiny. Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike, with 22 goals and 10 assists this season, fits the bill as a potential addition – though like most of Liverpool’s targets, he won’t come cheap.\n\nLiverpool’s Relentless Ethos Remains\n\nThis week’s reflections included a poignant reminder from Graeme Souness: “Nothing has changed at Liverpool.” The quest for continual improvement remains at the club’s core. His recollection of a conversation with Tom Saunders – who worked under Paisley, Fagan and Dalglish – summed up the mentality that drove Liverpool to dominate Europe in the past.\n\n“Tom relayed a story that Bob, on a regular basis, would say, ‘I’m not happy with him, then… I think we can do better in that position, then… I think he’s tailing off…’ And these were comments about a team that was winning a league title or European Cup every year.”\n\nThat hunger for progress remains. “They were never completely happy with the group they had and that was a large part of Liverpool’s success over the decades,” said Souness. Slot, it seems, is cut from similar cloth.\n\nCredit to the Architects Behind the Scenes\n\nRichard Hughes, Liverpool’s sporting director, has gone about his work with the kind of calm confidence that shapes winning cultures. Taking over with Mo Salah, Virgil van Dijk, and Trent Alexander-Arnold all approaching contract uncertainty, he’s already extended the former two and is believed to be steering Trent’s future with composure.\n\nMore impressive still is his decision to appoint Arne Slot. In a post-Klopp world, getting that call right was arguably Hughes’ most important act to date. Slot’s fast integration, clear vision and team harmony are already testament to Hughes’ acumen.\n\nAny whispers of a bloated “war chest” are misleading. The club does have money to spend – but with restraint and clarity. Hughes and Slot are aligned not just in ambition, but in values: sustainability, strategy, and squad evolution.\n\nAnd yet, with all this meticulous planning, they haven’t lost sight of the moment. Title No 20 will be rightly celebrated. But in the corridors of Anfield, the focus is clear: 21 must follow – and it must be earned.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThere’s something exhilarating about the measured confidence of this Liverpool rebuild. Slot’s celebration – humble, familial, and grounded – tells you everything you need to know about the man. He’s already one of us.\n\nHearing that he’s already thinking about the 21st title before the champagne from the 20th has dried is music to our ears. This isn’t short-term thinking; it’s legacy building. Slot and Hughes working in tandem could be the most important double act we’ve seen at Anfield since Gerrard and Torres.\n\nWhat truly excites fans is how the club is blending experience with next-generation planning. Alisson’s successor being lined up? That’s foresight. Scouting Simons, Sesko and Mamardashvili? That’s smart. Considering alternatives to Trent, Robbo and Konaté while still fighting to keep their best form? That’s ruthless – in the best way.\n\nThe concerns around Darwin Nunez are real – he divides opinion – but knowing there’s already a shortlist with players like Ekitike suggests Liverpool won’t waste time.\n\nMore than anything, this report shows that the ethos of Liverpool – the hunger, the restlessness, the pride – is alive and well. And with Arne Slot at the wheel, there’s a real feeling that title 20 is just the beginning."}

Now she’s been collecting Hudson’s Bay items for a decade Duration 3:48 With Hudson’s Bay liquidating all but six of its stores in Canada, items with their iconic HBC stripes are flying off the shelves. Emma Weller spoke with a Gatineau woman who has been collecting them for years.\n\nBeleaguered retailer Hudson's Bay has attracted a bid from Canadian Tire, two sources familiar with the sales process say.\n\nThe sources, who are not being named because they were not authorized to speak about the matter, say the household goods chain has made a bid for some of the faltering department store's intellectual property.\n\nAsked whether the company is making a bid, Canadian Tire did not provide a comment.\n\nAnyone interested in owning Hudson's Bay assets had until 5 p.m. on Wednesday to make a formal bid as part of the retailer's creditor protection court case.\n\nToronto investment manager Urbana Corp. has made a bid for the company's intellectual property, while billionaire B.C. mall owner Weihong Liu has said she would make a pitch to run some Bay stores. Liu told the Toronto Star Wednesday she had bid on 25 locations.\n\nThe 355-year-old department store's assets hit the sales block after Hudson's Bay filed for creditor protection earlier this year. It began liquidating its 80 Bay stores and 16 it ran under the Saks brands while it hunted for buyers or investors who would keep the company alive.\n\nThe company has a wealth of intellectual property including rights to its famed Stripes brand, discount chain Zellers, housewares brand Gluckstein, apparel line Hudson North and its Distinctly Home bed and bath products.\n\nHudson's Bay spokesperson Tiffany Bourré declined to comment on any potential bidders.\n\nAdam Zalev, managing director at Bay financial adviser Reflect Advisors, said multiple bids have been made for the company's assets and are now being evaluated.

Slow-charging EVs could have big benefit\n\nJulia McNally, director of climate action at Toronto Hydro, finds that Level 1 charging, which uses a regular wall outlet, is all she needs to keep her EV charged. (Submitted by Julia McNally)\n\nWhen Julia McNally decided to buy an EV and started her research, she came across a lot of articles and ads pushing an apparent must-have accessory — a speedy home charger designed specifically for EVs.\n\n\"Everything was pointing me to Level 2,\" recalled McNally, director of climate action at Toronto Hydro.\n\nShe knew that all EVs can do Level 1 slow charging, or \"trickle charging,\" from a regular 120-volt wall outlet, adding about six kilometres of range per hour (except in very cold winter temperatures, which can slow charging speeds). And she already had an outlet of those in her backyard, near the alleyway where she planned to park her new Mini EV.\n\nBut more than four out of five U.S. EV owners used Level 2 for home-charging in 2023, according to market research firm J.D. Power . Using a higher 240 voltage, often needed for a stove or dryer, Level 2 chargers can add about 30 to 50 kilometres of range per hour and refill a typical EV's entire 400-kilometre range overnight.\n\nMeanwhile, Level 3, or DC fast chargers, often installed along major highways, can add 250 kilometres of range per hour (some are even faster) and charge a battery to 80 per cent in 30 minutes.\n\nSome experts, such as Daniel Breton, CEO of Electric Mobility Canada, have argued people \"really need\" Level 2 chargers at home, as it can take days to charge an empty battery to full at Level 1.\n\nBut most people don't drive the hundreds of kilometres needed to empty their battery each day — and there's a downside to faster charging.\n\n\"You're adding cost,\" McNally said — potentially thousands of dollars.\n\n\n\nRead more from CBC's Emily Chung.\n\nOntario is scaling back species at risk protections, worrying advocates and inviting federal intervention\n\nBirds swim in the waters of Lake Ontario overlooking the city of Toronto skyline in Mississauga, Ont. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)\n\nOntario's government wants to \"unleash\" its resources with sweeping changes to its laws on protecting species at risk aimed at speeding up environmental approvals.\n\n\"With President Trump taking direct aim at our economy, it cannot be business as usual,\" said Ontario Premier Doug Ford while announcing the government's proposed Bill 5, also known as the Protect Ontario by Unleashing Our Economy Act, at the Toronto Stock Exchange on April 17.\n\nThe government has portrayed the current system as slow and cumbersome, driving away resource and development companies from Ontario. But the new bill is raising alarms from environmental groups, who say it could force the federal government to intervene to enforce its own overlapping protections. Here's a look at some of the changes in the bill, which is currently being debated at second reading in the provincial legislature.\n\n\n\nThe new law would remove provincial protections for certain aquatic species and migratory birds that are also protected under the federal Species at Risk Act.\n\n\n\n\"Currently, proponents must get approval under both federal and provincial species legislation, causing unnecessary duplication,\" said Gary Wheeler, spokesperson for Ontario's Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks.\n\n\n\n\"Under the new legislation, proponents will not need separate provincial approval for activities affecting aquatic species and migratory birds already protected by federal legislation.\"\n\n\n\nDavid Browne, senior vice-president for conservation and policy at Birds Canada, is worried about this move, because he says the federal law was never designed to completely replace the provincial law.\n\n\n\nThe federal government has the power to order the province to protect the critical habitat of an endangered species, according to Brown, but he says it's something Ottawa rarely does, and the preferred approach is to work with Ontario to protect birds and other wildlife.\n\n\n\n\"That tool is there as a backstop, not as, like, the way we want to do this. It's there as a last resort,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRead more of CBC's Inayat Singh's story here.\n\nWhat else is going on?\n\nQuebec to impose full ban on cellphones in schools\n\nBan will apply from start to end of school day, including on breaks, starting next fall.\n\n'Don't shut up': Canadian auto sector's strategy to fight Trump tariffs\n\nFlavio Volpe's comments came a day after U.S. president visited Michigan.\n\nTrudeau wanted ranked ballots.

She said our work helped motivate her through an arduous recovery process following a serious car accident last year. Although her entire story is both heartbreaking and inspiring, this one line made me pause and think:\n\n“The happiest moment of my life is still that split-second a year ago when, as I laid crushed under a 2000 pound car, I realized my husband and 9-year-old boy were out of the vehicle and absolutely OK.”\n\nDire moments like this force us to acknowledge what’s truly important to us. In Hope’s case it was her husband and son. And in the remainder of her email she talks about how her family spends significantly more time together now, sharing daily stories, telling little jokes, and appreciating each other’s company. “The accident made us realize how much time and joy we had been wasting every day on things that weren’t even important, which prevented us from spending quality time with each other,” she said.\n\nIt’s hard to think about a story like Hope’s and not ask yourself: What do I need to stop wasting my time and joy on?\n\nHere are some things to consider that I’ve been examining closely in my own life:\n\n1. Distractions that pull you away from moments with important people.\n\nPay attention to the little things today, because when you really miss someone you miss the little things the most, like just laughing together. Go for long walks. Indulge in great conversations. Count your mutual blessings. Let go for a little while and just be together.\n\n2. Compulsive busyness.\n\nSchedule time every day to not be busy. Have dedicated downtime — clear points in the day to reflect, rest, and recharge. Don’t fool yourself; you’re not so busy that you can’t afford a few minutes of sanity every day. Over the past decade, Marc and I have gradually learned to pay more attention to the beauty and practicality of living a simpler life. A life uncluttered by most of the default busyness people fill their lives with, leaving us with space for what’s truly meaningful. A life that isn’t constant rushing, worrying and stress, but instead contemplation, creation, and connection with the people and projects that matter most to us.\n\n3. Thinking negatively about your abilities.\n\nJust because you’re struggling doesn’t mean you’re failing. Every great success requires some type of worthy struggle to get there. And don’t wish away all your days waiting for better ones ahead. Just appreciate where you are. You’ve come a long way, and you’re still learning and growing. Be thankful for the lessons. Take them and make the best of things right now.\n\n4. The needless drama around you.\n\nA big part of maturity is learning to gracefully walk away from situations that threaten your peace of mind, self-respect, values, morals, or self-worth. Practice letting go gradually. Remind yourself that you don’t need to attend every argument you’re invited to. Give yourself the space to value your time, genuine relationships, and peace of mind, above all in the weeks ahead. Because little else will matter more in the long run.\n\n5. The desire for everything you don’t have.\n\nNo, you won’t always get exactly what you want, but also remember that there are lots of people who will never have what you have right now. Some of the things you take for granted someone else is praying for. Happiness never comes to those who don’t appreciate what they already have. So remind yourself: You did not go to sleep hungry last night. You had a choice of what to wear today. You have access to clean drinking water. You have access to the internet. You can read. The secret to being grateful is no secret. You choose to be grateful, for the little things.\n\n6. Comparing yourself to everyone else.\n\nSocial comparison is a notorious thief of daily joy and progress. You could literally spend a lifetime worrying about what others have, but it wouldn’t get you anything worth having. Do your best to keep your comparison radar in check.\n\n7. Obsessing over who you were or what you had in the past.\n\nYou’re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or a week ago. You’re always evolving and growing. Experiences don’t stop… that’s life, and it’s a privilege!\n\n8. Worrying about old mistakes.\n\nIt’s OK if you mess up in life — that’s how you get wiser. Give yourself a break. Great things take time, and you’re getting there. Let your mistakes be your motivation, not your excuses. Decide right now that yesterday’s little mistakes and frustrations won’t get in your way today.\n\n9. Worrying about what everyone thinks and says about you.\n\nDon’t take things too personally, even if it seems personal. Rarely do people do things because of you; they do things because of them. You honestly can’t change how people treat you or what they say about you. All you can do is change how you react and who you choose to be around. And remember that one of the most freeing things we learn in life is that we don’t have to like everyone, everyone doesn’t have to like us, and that’s perfectly OK. Because no matter how you live, someone will be disappointed. So just live your truth and be sure YOU aren’t the one who is disappointed in the end.\n\n10. Self-deception.\n\nYour life will improve only when you take small chances. And the first and most difficult chance you can take every day is to be honest with yourself.\n\n11. A life path that doesn’t feel rewarding.\n\nLife is to be enjoyed, not endured. When you truly believe in what you’re doing, it shows, and it pays in the long run. Success in life is for those who put their heart and soul into their daily efforts. And as you struggle, remember, it’s far better to be exhausted from little bits of effort and learning, than it is to be tired of doing absolutely nothing.\n\n12. Everyone else’s definition of success and happiness.\n\nYou simply can’t base your idea of success and happiness on other people’s opinions and expectations. And likewise, don’t judge someone else just because they do it differently than you. The world is changed by your example, not by your opinions and judgments.\n\n13. People who keep trying to manipulate you.\n\nIn many cases, what you allow is what will continue. Give as much as you can, but don’t allow yourself to be continuously used. Listen to others closely, but don’t lose your own voice in the process. Set some boundaries when you must! (Note: Marc and I discuss this in detail in the Boundaries & Expectations chapter of “1,000 Little Habits of Happy, Successful Relationships”.)\n\n14. Doubting and second-guessing yourself.\n\nRemind yourself that you’re doing the best you can, and that sometimes it takes an overwhelming series of little breakdowns to have an undeniable breakthrough. When in doubt just take the next small step. Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction ends up being the biggest step of your life. Truly, there’s a time and place for everything, and every step is necessary. Just do your best right now, and don’t force what’s not yet supposed to fit into your life. It will happen, when it’s time.\n\n15. Thinking the perfect time will come.\n\nSome people wait all day for 5pm, all week for Friday, all year for the holidays, all their lives for happiness. Don’t be one of them! You can’t always wait for the perfect moment. Sometimes you must dare to do it because life is too short to wonder what could have been, again and again.\n\n16. Avoidance and temporary fixes.\n\nYou can’t change what you refuse to fully confront. You can’t find peace or progress by avoiding things. Deal with problems directly before they deal with your long-term happiness and potential. Build sustainable habits that move your life forward, one day at a time.\n\n17. Resentment.\n\nKindness is not to be mistaken for weakness, nor forgiveness for acceptance. It’s about knowing that resentment is not on the path to long-term happiness.\n\n18. Hateful thoughts and gestures.\n\nSet an example. Treat everyone with kindness and respect, even those who are rude to you — not because they are nice, but because you are. And do it for yourself too! What goes around comes around. No one has ever made themselves strong by showing how small someone else is.\n\n19. Close-minded judgments.\n\nThe mind is like a parachute; it doesn’t work when it’s closed. So build friendships with people who aren’t your age. Spend time around those whose first language is different than your own. Get to know someone who doesn’t come from the same social class. Listen. Be humble and teachable. This is how you learn. This is how you see the world.\n\n20. Trying to gain control over the uncontrollable.\n\nYou can’t calm the storm. What you can do is calm yourself, and the storm will eventually pass. The most powerful and practical changes happen when you decide to take control of what you do have power over, instead of craving control over what you don’t.\n\nNow it’s your turn!\n\nYes, it’s your turn to treat your limited time today with care. It’s your turn to make room for more joy. Because there’s a big difference between empty fatigue and gratifying exhaustion, and life is just too short…\n\nBut before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post.

This device offers reliable software, impressive battery performance, and a compact design that appeals to users seeking simplicity and functionality. However, it comes with notable trade-offs, including outdated features and limited hardware capabilities. The iPhone 16e is best suited for users with basic needs or those looking for a secondary smartphone. If you’re expecting innovative technology or premium build quality, this model may not meet your expectations. The video below from Sam Beckman gives us a detailed look at the handset from an Android user’s perspective.\n\nDesign: Compact but Dated\n\nThe iPhone 16e features a compact and lightweight design that fits comfortably in your hand, making it ideal for users who prefer smaller devices. Its matte finish on the back and sides adds a subtle touch of sophistication, while the buttons maintain Apple’s signature tactile quality. However, the design feels outdated, closely resembling older iPhone models with squared edges and a notch-style display. The protruding camera bump is another drawback, as it causes the phone to wobble when placed on flat surfaces. While the design is functional and durable, it lacks the modern aesthetics and sleekness found in Apple’s higher-end devices.\n\nDisplay: Vibrant Colors, Outdated Features\n\nThe iPhone 16e’s OLED display delivers vibrant colors and deep blacks, making sure a pleasant viewing experience for everyday use. However, its peak brightness of 800 nits makes outdoor visibility challenging, especially under direct sunlight. The 60 Hz refresh rate feels outdated compared to the smoother 90 Hz or 120 Hz displays available on similarly priced Android devices. Additionally, the absence of an always-on display feature may disappoint users accustomed to more advanced screen technologies. While the display is serviceable for basic tasks, it falls short of the standards set by competitors in the same price range.\n\nBattery Life: A Clear Strength\n\nBattery life is one of the iPhone 16e’s strongest features, offering 8-10 hours of screen-on time, which is sufficient for a full day of moderate use. The device supports wireless charging, but it lacks MagSafe compatibility, a feature that many Apple users have come to appreciate for its convenience and ecosystem integration. Despite this limitation, the battery performance is exceptional for a budget-friendly device, making sure you won’t need to scramble for a charger during the day. This makes the iPhone 16e a reliable choice for users prioritizing longevity over innovative features.\n\nCamera: Reliable but Limited\n\nThe iPhone 16e is equipped with a single 48 MP rear camera, which performs reliably in well-lit conditions. It captures sharp and detailed images, making it suitable for casual photography. However, the absence of ultra-wide or telephoto lenses significantly limits its versatility. In low-light scenarios, the camera struggles to deliver the same quality seen in Apple’s higher-end models, with noticeable noise and reduced detail. While the camera is adequate for everyday use, users seeking advanced imaging capabilities or creative flexibility may find it lacking.\n\nSoftware: Familiar but Unpolished\n\nRunning on iOS 18, the iPhone 16e provides the familiar Apple software experience, complete with the promise of long-term updates. The operating system offers customization options, such as control center tweaks and custom icons, allowing users to personalize their devices to some extent. However, iOS 18 has its quirks, including occasional bugs and limited AI feature integration, which may detract from the overall user experience. While the software is reliable and functional, it lacks the polish and refinement found in Apple’s flagship devices, making it feel less premium despite its association with the Apple brand.\n\nWho Should Consider the iPhone 16e?\n\nThe iPhone 16e is an excellent choice for users who prioritize affordability and prefer smaller, more manageable devices. It’s particularly suitable for those who are not accustomed to high refresh rate displays or advanced camera systems. Additionally, it serves well as a secondary smartphone for work, development, or travel purposes. However, power users and individuals seeking flagship features, such as innovative performance or innovative designs, may find the iPhone 16e underwhelming. Its appeal lies in its simplicity and reliability, making it a practical option for specific user groups.\n\nAlternatives: Exploring Better Value\n\nBefore committing to the iPhone 16e, it’s worth exploring alternatives that may offer better value for a similar price. For instance, refurbished models like the iPhone 14 Pro provide access to advanced features, such as ProMotion displays, improved camera systems, and premium build quality. Android devices in the same price range often include higher refresh rate displays, larger batteries, and more versatile camera setups, making them competitive options. While the iPhone 16e delivers a basic and reliable Apple experience, it lacks the innovation and versatility of higher-end models. For users seeking a no-frills iPhone, the 16e is a viable option, but those expecting more may find better alternatives elsewhere.\n\nMaster iPhone 16e with the help of our in-depth articles and helpful guides.\n\nSource & Image Credit: Sam Beckman\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

It aimed to redefine how users interact with their devices, promising smarter, more intuitive features. However, its rollout has sparked mixed reactions. While some features showcase potential, others have fallen short, leaving users questioning its overall value. The video below from Zollotech gives us more insights into the current state of Apple Intelligence, exploring its strengths, limitations, and what the future may hold for this ambitious platform.\n\nDevice Compatibility: A Significant Hurdle\n\nOne of the most debated aspects of Apple Intelligence is its restrictive hardware requirements. The platform’s features are only accessible on devices equipped with at least 8GB of RAM, effectively excluding older iPhone models. This decision has sidelined a substantial portion of Apple’s user base, particularly those using devices released before the iPhone 15. For many users, the promise of advanced AI capabilities feels out of reach, creating frustration and a sense of exclusion.\n\nLooking ahead, the situation may become even more challenging. Industry rumors suggest that future updates could demand even higher RAM capacities—potentially 12GB—making the features exclusive to newer models like the iPhone 17 and beyond. This trend raises concerns about accessibility and inclusivity, as users with older devices are left behind in the evolution of Apple’s AI ecosystem.\n\nFeature Rollouts: A Fragmented Approach\n\nApple’s decision to stagger the release of its AI features has also drawn criticism. Instead of delivering a comprehensive suite of tools at launch, the company opted for a piecemeal rollout. For example, Siri 2.0—a highly anticipated upgrade promising contextual understanding and real-time assistance—has been delayed until iOS 19 or later. This fragmented approach has dampened the initial excitement surrounding Apple Intelligence, leaving users waiting for key features to materialize.\n\nThe staggered release strategy has raised questions about Apple’s execution and planning. While the company may have intended to refine features over time, the lack of a cohesive launch has undermined the platform’s potential. Users are left with a sense of incompleteness, which detracts from the overall experience and raises doubts about Apple’s ability to deliver on its promises.\n\nKey Features: Innovation Meets Inconsistency\n\nDespite its challenges, Apple Intelligence introduces several intriguing features. However, their performance has been inconsistent, leading to mixed user experiences. Below is a closer look at some of the platform’s key tools:\n\nSiri Updates: Siri’s new visual design is a refreshing change, but its intelligence and contextual understanding remain largely unchanged. This has disappointed users who expected a more advanced virtual assistant capable of handling complex tasks.\n\nSiri’s new visual design is a refreshing change, but its intelligence and contextual understanding remain largely unchanged.

ChatGPT Integration: The integration of ChatGPT brings AI-driven capabilities to iOS, but its inconsistent performance often leaves users dissatisfied. While it shows potential, its current state lacks the reliability needed for widespread adoption.\n\nThese features highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of Apple Intelligence. While some tools offer glimpses of innovation, their inconsistent performance undermines their impact, leaving users with a mixed impression of the platform.\n\nUnmet Promises: A Source of Frustration\n\nApple Intelligence was marketed as a fantastic step forward in mobile AI, but many of its promises remain unfulfilled. Siri 2.0, touted as a private and contextually aware assistant, is still unavailable. Similarly, advanced notification summaries and visual intelligence tools have yet to deliver the reliability and precision users were led to expect.\n\nThese unmet promises have left many users feeling disappointed, particularly those who upgraded to the iPhone 16 in anticipation of a superior AI experience. Persistent bugs and performance issues across updates have further eroded trust in Apple’s AI ambitions. For a platform that was supposed to redefine the mobile AI experience, its current state falls far short of expectations.\n\nFuture Prospects: Can Apple Turn It Around?\n\nDespite its rocky start, Apple Intelligence has the potential to evolve into a more robust and reliable platform. Upcoming updates, including those expected at WWDC 2025, may address current shortcomings and introduce new features. Additionally, Apple’s rumored collaboration with external AI tools like Google Gemini could enhance its capabilities and broaden its appeal.\n\nHowever, whether these improvements will be enough to restore user confidence remains uncertain. Apple faces the dual challenge of refining its technology and rebuilding trust among its user base. The company’s ability to deliver on its promises will determine whether Apple Intelligence can achieve its ambitious vision or remain a missed opportunity.\n\nApple Intelligence represents a bold vision for the future of mobile AI. While it offers glimpses of innovation, its execution has been uneven, leaving users with a platform that feels incomplete. As Apple works to address these issues, the question remains: can it deliver on its promises and redefine the mobile AI experience? For now, Apple Intelligence remains a work in progress—one that holds promise but has yet to fully deliver.\n\nHere is a selection of other guides from our extensive library of content you may find of interest on Apple Intelligence.\n\nSource & Image Credit: zollotech\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at TMC Life Sciences Berhad (KLSE:TMCLIFE) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for TMC Life Sciences Berhad, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.02 = RM21m ÷ (RM1.1b - RM107m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nTherefore, TMC Life Sciences Berhad has an ROCE of 2.0%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Healthcare industry average of 9.9%.\n\nView our latest analysis for TMC Life Sciences Berhad\n\nKLSE:TMCLIFE Return on Capital Employed May 4th 2025\n\nWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you want to delve into the historical earnings , check out these free graphs detailing revenue and cash flow performance of TMC Life Sciences Berhad.\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at TMC Life Sciences Berhad doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 4.1%, but since then they've fallen to 2.0%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.\n\nOur Take On TMC Life Sciences Berhad's ROCE\n\nTo conclude, we've found that TMC Life Sciences Berhad is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And in the last five years, the stock has given away 12% so the market doesn't look too hopeful on these trends strengthening any time soon. Therefore based on the analysis done in this article, we don't think TMC Life Sciences Berhad has the makings of a multi-bagger."}

Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT) Could Be Struggling To Allocate Capital", "fullContent": "If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at J.B. Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.\n\nWe check all companies for important risks. See what we found for J.B. Hunt Transport Services in our free report.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on J.B. Hunt Transport Services is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.13 = US$816m ÷ (US$8.3b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2025).\n\nSo, J.B. Hunt Transport Services has an ROCE of 13%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 7.5% generated by the Transportation industry.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for J.B. Hunt Transport Services\n\nNasdaqGS:JBHT Return on Capital Employed May 4th 2025\n\nIn the above chart we have measured J.B. Hunt Transport Services' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering J.B. Hunt Transport Services for free.\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at J.B. Hunt Transport Services, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 18% over the last five years. However it looks like J.B. Hunt Transport Services might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From J.B. Hunt Transport Services' ROCE\n\nIn summary, J.B. Hunt Transport Services is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 35% to shareholders over the last five years. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options."}

I realize that this sounds like something that Hollywood would dream up, but this isn’t a plot from an episode of your favorite television show. This is really happening. President Trump has decided to raise the level of economic pressure on Iran to the maximum in a last-ditch effort to force the Iranians to make a deal to end their nuclear program. The oil industry is the central pillar of the Iranian economy, and President Trump wants to make it impossible for them to export any oil at all. So he is threatening to completely cut off all trade with any nation that purchases any amount of Iranian oil.\n\nThis is what a trade war looks like when it goes nuclear.\n\nPresident Trump is pledging that any nation that buys Iranian oil “will not be allowed to do business with the United States of America in any way, shape, or form”. He didn’t mention China specifically when he wrote this, but Trump knows that China buys far more oil from Iran than anyone else.\n\nFor some reason, the mainstream media is mostly ignoring this story. But State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce has confirmed that this is now U.S. policy and that China in particular is being targeted…\n\n“These sanctions are being imposed pursuant to President Trump’s maximum pressure campaign to drive Iran’s oil exports, including to China, to zero. China is by far the largest importer of Iranian oil. The Iranian regime uses the revenue it generates from these sales to finance attacks on U.S. allies, support terrorism around the world, and pursue other destabilizing actions,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said.\n\nThis is it.\n\nWe really have reached a moment of truth.\n\nIn 2025, approximately 90 percent of all Iranian oil exports have been purchased by China…\n\nShipping data from cargo tracking company Vortexa shows that 90 percent of Iranian oil exports are purchased by China, and Iranian oil exports to China hit a record high of 1.8 million barrels per day in March, Reuters reported, citing ship tracking data.\n\nChina isn’t going to stop buying oil from Iran.\n\nI hope that I am wrong about that, but I do not believe that I am.\n\nAnd I do not believe that Trump is bluffing either.\n\nSo it appears that we are about to see a full shutdown of all trade with China.\n\nMost Americans have absolutely no idea what that will mean for us.\n\nIt is being reported that “90% of the inputs in prescription drugs consumed in the US are imported”, and a “significant portion” of those inputs are produced by the Chinese…\n\n“Estimates show that 90% of the inputs in prescription drugs consumed in the US are imported,” said Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo. A significant portion of that comes from China, making it a major supply chain risk. Ongoing tariff disputes between Washington and Beijing have investors on edge, especially in healthcare and pharmaceuticals, where any price shock could ripple across the industry and impact both investors and patients.\n\nThis is a really big deal, because as I have discussed previously, more than 60 percent of all U.S. adults are currently taking at least one pharmaceutical drug.\n\nAccording to supply chain analytics company Exiger, about 80 percent of the active ingredients in our pharmaceutical drugs come from China…\n\nAccording to a report from the supply chain analytics company Exiger released last week, the US relies on China for as much as 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients. For generic antibiotics, in particular, the dependence is much higher at 90 percent.\n\nIf there is a complete shutdown of trade with China, you are going to see drug shortages like you have never seen before.\n\nI wish that I was exaggerating, but I am not.\n\nEven 95 percent of our ibuprofen comes from China.\n\nGood luck getting ibuprofen when none is coming across the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOf course there will be shortages in countless other industries as well.\n\nRight now, most of our computers and phones are made in China…\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the U.S. relies on imports from China for a majority of the following products by value: game consoles (86%, $6 billion), PC monitors (79%, $5 billion), smartphones (73%, $41 billion), lithium-ion batteries (70%, $16 billion), and laptops (66%, $32 billion). This means consumers and businesses that need these products will have few to zero alternatives for products that do not come from China.\n\nOur stores are filled with televisions, appliances, toys, and other products that are made in China.\n\nI hate to say it, but our economy literally cannot function normally without Chinese-made goods.\n\nWe should never have allowed this to happen, but this is the reality of the scenario that we are now facing.\n\nThe good news is that it appears that the Chinese are still leaving the door open for a potential deal…\n\nChina has said it’s evaluating approaches from US officials to start negotiations about tariffs, a potential deescalation in the trade war that has raised hopes formal trade talks could start soon. “If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open,” China’s commerce ministry stated on Friday. “The tariff war and trade war were unilaterally initiated by the United States. If the United States wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel the unilateral tariffs.”\n\nHopefully, the U.S. and China will sit down and talk, and hopefully, both sides will be in a mood to make significant compromises.\n\nBecause if we stay on the path that we are currently on, it will be a nightmare.\n\nEven before the trade war erupted about a month ago, many U.S. consumers were stocking up in anticipation of the coming tariffs…\n\nSimilarly, according to a survey of 1,000 consumers by NielsenIQ done in March, 31% of consumers said they were stocking up on groceries in anticipation of tariffs while others said they were expediting non-grocery purchases before tariff-related price increases took effect.\n\nHave you been stocking up?\n\nI hope so.\n\nIf there are any Chinese-made products that you will need in the months ahead, get them now.\n\nIf all trade with China is suddenly brought to a screeching halt, it is going to throw our society into a state of great chaos.\n\nMichael’s new book entitled “10 Prophetic Events That Are Coming Next” is available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.com, and you can subscribe to his Substack newsletter at michaeltsnyder.substack.com.\n\nAbout the Author: Michael Snyder’s new book, entitled “10 Prophetic Events That Are Coming Next,” is available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.com.

For generations, it’s been a go-to phrase for cordial, noncommittal well-wishing, even if it’s not a particularly personalized piece of prose.\n\nHowever, “Have a cool summer” takes on an added joyous significance when it’s the unspoken message from Totoro.\n\nWith the start of summer coming up fast, Studio Ghibli specialty shop Donguri Kyowakoku is standing by with its Towel Pillow Cover series, featuring characters from anime classics My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki’s Delivery Service, and Spirited Away. Starting with the Totoro designs, there are three to choose from, with the first showing the Big Totoro on one side, and the Small Totoro on the other, with a group of Soot Sprites hanging out with them.\n\nEarly summer in Japan is marked by frequent rain showers, which makes not only the motif on the above pillow appropriate, and the high humidity that continues for the entire season is what inspires the material choice. Made of a stretchy, 95-percent cotton, 5-percent polyurethane blend, the terrycloth-like Towel Pillow Cover are invitingly soft, but also breathable and absorbent, helping reduce sweating while you sleep and also soaking up any perspiration your head still needs to produce. They’re essentially pillowcase counterparts to the Totoro and Catbus towelket blankets we looked at a while back.\n\nAh, but what about the Medium Totoro, the mid-sized blue forest spirit? Don’t worry, here’s present and accounted for too in a patterned pillowcase.\n\nThe gray Totoro pattern cover is actually a bit of a conversation piece/debate prompt. From the color, you might assume that it’s depicting the Big Totoro, and the chubbier proportions also align with the largest-size version of the creature. Even Donguri Kyowakoku itself designates it the “Big Totoro Silhouette” pillow cover.\n\nHowever, if you look closely, you’ll see that these gray Totoros only have three markings on their chest, like the Medium Totoro, and not the more numerous marks the Big Totoro is usually depicted with.\n\n▼ Both cases have “My Neighbor Totoro” written on their reverse sides.\n\nAlso here to help you stay cool as you sleep is Spirited Away’s No Face, flanked by Soot Sprites and with the 油 emblem of the Aburaya bathhouse of the gods…\n\n…and his travel companions mouse-form Boh and Yu-Bird on the other side.\n\nFinally, there are two Kiki’s Delivery Service Towel Pillow Covers…\n\n…with black cat Jiji representing the charter cast, though the sign little witch Kiki hands up outside the bakery she runs her courier enterprise from is shown too.\n\nThe second pillowcase, though, is all Jiji.\n\nDonguri Kyowakoku lists all of the pillowcases as “for adult-use,” but that’s a reference to their size, not an indication that they’re inappropriate for young children, as they’re for use with pillows 63 centimeters (24.8 inches) in length.

That’s why you rarely get the same answer twice,” he said in an interview.\n\nEven with browsing and fact-checking features, Chuah said AI still retrieves and summarises content without comprehension.\n\nHe said the polished nature of AI-generated text can mislead users into mistaking fluency for factual accuracy.\n\n“In workshops, I often see people assume something must be true because it sounds sophisticated.\n\n“But AI can confidently present outdated or false information. Its speed trains people to verify less and think less critically,” he said.\n\nChuah also cautioned against assuming that using AI equates to understanding how it works.\n\n“Even experts are still trying to unravel how large models arrive at certain outputs, the so-called ‘black box’ problem.”\n\nTo use AI wisely, Chuah said users should view its output as a starting point and not as a conclusion.\n\n“Stay curious but cautious. Treat AI as a helpful assistant, not an authority.\n\n“Develop ‘prompt literacy’ because learning to phrase prompts well reduces the risk of being misled,” he said.\n\nHe added that image and video generators are equally prone to flaws as they assemble visuals based on probability.\n\n“If we don’t blindly trust humans, we shouldn’t blindly trust machines either,” he said.\n\nAssoc Prof Dr Geshina Ayu Mat Saat, a criminologist and psychologist at Universiti Sains Malaysia, said people are psychologically inclined to trust confident and structured answers, even from machines.\n\n“This stems from cognitive biases, social conditioning and evolutionary traits.\n\n“Authority bias, cognitive ease and the illusion of understanding all contribute,” she said.\n\nGeshina said fluent and assertive AI responses often mimic traits that associate with expertise, triggering automatic trust even if the content is flawed.\n\n“People fear uncertainty. A confident AI answer gives psychological relief.\n\n“Our brains prefer smooth, simple explanations to complex or ambiguous ones,” she said.\n\nTo counter this, Geshina recommended a triangulation mindset which is to only accept AI responses when they align with at least two independent, credible sources.\n\nShe also encouraged delayed judgment, source awareness and failure literacy.\n\nAlex Liew, chairman of the National Tech Association of Malaysia (Pikom), echoed similar concerns, saying AI tools rely heavily on data which includes false or biased information found online.\n\n“AI isn’t inherently smarter than humans. It processes data using fixed rules, which makes its answers sound polished but not necessarily correct,” he said.\n\nLiew said Pikom recently published a paper on AI Ethics and Governance, urging industry-wide accountability.\n\n“AI helps us process massive data but it should never be the final arbiter. That role still belongs to humans.”\n\nProf Dr C. Sara of Universiti Teknologi MARA said despite the risks, generative AI has practical strengths when used responsibly.\n\n“AI can generate articles in minutes and assist in producing large volumes of content, including personalised social media posts.\n\n“AI tools can also help with language localisation, keyword suggestions for search engine optimisation and overcoming writer’s block through idea generation,” she said.\n\nSara, however, stressed the importance of accuracy.\n\n“To avoid spreading misinformation or damaging your brand, cross-check AI content with trusted sources.\n\n“Look for citations, spot inconsistencies and consult experts for niche topics,” she said.\n\nSara said while AI is here to stay, ultimately human judgment must remain a constant."}

Typically, he shows up for Weekend Update, and that’s the extent of his work in front of the camera. Not this week. The former head writer made a surprise cameo in a real sketch from the latest episode of Saturday Night Live Season 50, and I bet you can guess what it was about: a ferry boat.\n\nJost famously purchased a decommissioned Staten Island ferry boat alongside former cast member Pete Davidson. Both men have close connections to the borough, and after Jost married A-lister Scarlett Johansson, one of their wedding announcements featured a ferry boat that said “Jost Married” on the side. They named their purchase Titanic 2.\n\nUnfortunately, the scheme has not gone according to plan, as three years later, it’s still a work in progress and a frequent source of snarky news articles. It’s also referenced on a semi-regular basis on SNL, sometimes by Jost himself and sometimes by other cast members. Even Johansson has roasted it during other media appearances.\n\nThis reference may go down as the most prominent ever, however, as it happened so unexpectedly. Host Quinta Brunson and cast members Mikey Day and Chloe Fineman were leads in a sketch playing drivers involved in a confrontation. They parked next to each other on a ferry boat and were not pleased, but because their windows were rolled up, they had to basically play charades to insult each other.\n\nIt’s pretty funny but also, in retrospect, obviously provides the perfect setting for Jost to dunk on himself. You can watch the full sketch below in which Jost shows up and tries to convince them to buy his ferry boat, even claiming he’s Pete Davidson at one point…\n\nFerry Altercation - SNL - YouTube Watch On\n\nBefore we get into the Jost part, let’s talk about the larger sketch real quick. Most of the time it’s the political sketches or the celebrity impressions that go mega-viral, but to me, this is the heart of Saturday Night Live and really sketch comedy in general. You throw some funny people into a random life situation and just let them push it as far as possible. I had a smile on my face throughout this entire sketch, and it seems like everyone involved in it was having a great time, as they acted out really random and inappropriate things.\n\nThe bigger story here, though, is, of course, the ferry boat part of it. It’s been getting some traction on social media, and it’s easy to see why. Jost is a great comedy writer and a skilled Weekend Update host. He’s also proven time and time again that he’s willing to laugh at himself and be the butt of jokes in order to get laughs. That’s a hallmark of so many great SNL comedians who have been willing to mine their personal lives and/ or put themselves in embarrassing situations in order to amuse the audience.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWith Jost, those personal life references have overwhelmingly been about the ferry boat or his marriage to Scarlett Johansson. Every single time, he’s executed them with a good-natured smile on his face, and given she’s hosting the season finale (which some fans are convinced could be Jost's last episode), there’s a good chance he’ll go there a few more times this year too. I can’t wait."}

This year’s LEGO Star Wars 40765 Kamino Training Facility (free with LEGO Star Wars purchases totalling US $160 | CAN $210 | UK £145) will be a big draw for many fans thanks to three exclusive Clone Cadet minifigures. We’ve scoured the sale and selected our ten favorite Star Wars sets that are available now.\n\nBudget Picks\n\nThe perfect companion set for this year’s UCS Jango Fett’s Starship is still avaialable and an excellent value among Star Wars ships. It’s also your only way to get a Kaminoan minigure to oversee your Clone production.\n\nLEGO Star Wars 40755 Imperial Dropship vs Rebel Scout Speeder | 383 Pieces | Available Now | US $39.99 | CAN $54.99 | UK £34.99.\n\nAs Theo points out in his review of 40755 Imperal Dropship vs Rebel Scout Speeder, this battle pack from last years is a remake of a classic set that’s a good reminder of how much LEGO Star Wars sets have changed since their debut 25 years ago. With 6 minifigs and an exclusive QT-KT astromech droid, this is a good army builder set with two solid vehicles as well.\n\nLEGO Star Wars 75390 Luke Skywalker X-Wing Mech | 195 Pieces | Available Now | US $15.99 | CAN $19.99 | UK £12.99.\n\nFor kids and kids-at-heart, Luke’s X-Wing mech is a fun Star Wars remix that’s great for play and display at an uncommonly reasonable price. it’s the slickest Star Wars mech LEGO has released and will have you swooshing and making lightsaber sounds in no time.\n\nMedium-Sized Selections\n\nLEGO Star Wars 75407 Star Wars Logo | 700 Pieces | Available May 1 | US $59.99 | CAN $79.99 | UK £59.99\n\nAt first we were skeptical about a set that was Star Wars, nothing but Star Wars… but as we found in our review of LEGO Star Wars 75407 Star Wars Logo, this set is a pleaser. It’s a fun build with a great shelf presence, and it’s an easy set to customize with your favorite minifigures to celebrate any era of the franchise. Just be careful not to flip the logo around or else you might face an outbreak of Star Ratz.\n\nStar Wars’ most iconic duo have never looked better together than in this pair of sets. Sporting a vast number of pearl gold elements, many of which are new in that color, C-3PO is shiny enough to impersonate a god. And while this version of R2 might not have ad many functions as the earlier UCS version, the design is clean and clever, and as a bonus he comes with the exclusive and excellent Darth Malak minifigure.\n\n75376 LEGO Star Wars Tantive IV | 654 Pieces | On Sale for Insiders | US $67.99 | CAN $84.99 | UK £59.49\n\nThe Tantive IV has the honor of being the first ever Star Wars vehicle to appear on screen. 48 years later, it also remains one of the series most iconic ship designs. This midi-scale model looks amazing but was compromised by lots of stickers and a steep price at launch. LEGO is discounting it for insiders, making this a good time to add one of the best sets in the Starship Collection to your shelves.\n\nThe Big Bounties\n\nLEGO Star Wars 75409 UCS Jango Fett’s Starship | 2970 Pieces | Available May 4 | US $299.99 | CAN $379 | UK £239.99\n\nIn his review of LEGO Star Wars 75409 UCS Jango Fett’s Starship, Theo praised the set’s excellent design, good value, and fine minifigures. This set tops our list of recommendations from LEGO’s newest wave.\n\nLEGO Star Wars 75331 UCS The Razor Crest | 6187 Pieces | On Sale to Insiders while Supplies Last | US $479.99 | CAN $607.99 | UK £415.99\n\n2022’s biggest Star Wars set is still in stock (for now!) with a hefty discount for LEGO Insiders. In our review of LEGO Star Wars 75331 UCS The Razor Crest, we praised the substantial and well-engineered build with minor caveats on price and color. At discount though, and with the ship returning to screens in next year’s The Mandalorian and Grogu movie, it could be time to strike.\n\nLast but certainly not least (quite the contrary!) LEGO’s biggest and most detailed Star Wars set is still available. First released in 2017, this set has also breaks records for remaining in circulation, but this could be the last Star Wars Day that the set is available. In our review of the LEGO Star Wars 75192 UCS Millennium Falcon, we called it a truly spectacular set… at a luxury price. This set remains the ultimate build for Star Wars fans with the budget and space to accomodate it. Lucky UK shoppers get a discount.\n\nRelated"}

On the cusp of our 20th anniversary, those archives run deep. (You heard that right. If the Battle of Yavin was happening right now, The Brothers Brick would have been founded right around the time Senator Palpatine was kidnapped by General Grievous!) There is one Star Wars vehicle that has been recreated and shared by adult fans of LEGO more than any other – the X-Wing Fighter. Just as each Jedi must construct their own lightsaber, creating an original X-Wing design is almost like a rite of passage for builders. Here are 10 of our favorite designs from builders who regular readers of the site will definitely recognize. We even have free instructions for the model featured in the cover.\n\nJoel Short debuted this take on the X-Wing exactly one year ago for Star Wars Day 2024. The builder painstakingly matched cockpit shaping, color blocking, and greebling to on-screen references. At the time, we called it the most Screen-accurate minifig scale X-Wing to date.\n\nTom Loftus (aka Inthert) is a master at working with shapes and colors for distinctive spaceship designs. His compact X-Wing upholds that legacy and still looks great 4 years later. Here’s what we had to say back in 2021. Tom was generous enough to share free instructions for this amazing X-Wing model, which you can download here.\n\nJared Reisweber always goes big! This coffee-table sized version of the X-Wing contains as many pieces as the UCS Millennium Falcon! Here’s what we had to say when we first saw this beast back in 2021.\n\nLately, Jarek Książczyk has been focusing on weirder and darker sci-fi creations, but over the years he’s put out some incredible Star Wars vehicles too, including what many consider the gold-standard X-Wing MOC. This pic is from the builder’s 2022 update. Here’s what we had to say about the model in 2018.\n\nMaciej Szymański mostly builds real world vehicles, but he made an exception for the X-Wing. You can read our comments from back in 2016 here. Since then, the builder has updated with an even slicker design.\n\nMike Psiaki is another builder specializing in real world vehicles who also couldn’t resist the allure of the X-Wing design. Here’s what we had to say back in 2011.\n\nZane Houston has been creating some out-of-this-world mech designs recently, but all the way back in 2011 he put his mark on the iconic X-Wing with a militarized design influenced by modern fighter jets. Here’s what we said back in the day.\n\nHannes Tscharner (aka Marshal Banana) most recently coordinated the jaw-dropping Rogue Ronin collab, but this LUG legend also made a memorable version of the X-Wing. Here are our comments from back in 2010.\n\nNo Star Wars builder has been as featured here as much as Tim Goddard, and yet somehow we missed covering his signature attempt at the iconic X-Wing from back in 2010, seen here. We did however cover his 2017 midi-scale versions that came out in celebration of Rogue One.\n\nOur very first X-Wing features were from a “X-Wing Evolved” contest put on by the venerable From Bricks to Bothans community. We especially liked this take from the late LEGO legend Nate “nnen” Nielson, which has one of the distinctive silhouettes the builder is known for. Here’s our coverage from way back in 2007.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this tour of X-WING mocs over the years. Putting together this list was a reminder of both builders that we’ve lost and builders who continue to grow and share after two decades. It’s fascinating to see how design trends change over time and how how changes in the available bricks influence the destails of such a familiar ship. Which model would you most like to pilot on a trench run?\n\nRelated"}

Sellers anticipating Bitcoin’s upswing might be in for trouble. Figures reveal over $3 billion worth of short positions potentially being erased should Bitcoin move over the coveted $100,000 threshold.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nMassive Short Positions Clustered Below $100K\n\nAccording to Coinglass, there’s a heavy concentration of short positions across major exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit between the $97K and $100K range. That cluster of bets against Bitcoin is now on shaky ground. A move past $100K could lead to a wave of liquidations totaling about $3.04 billion.\n\nIf Bitcoin goes even further—to approximately $105,000—liquidations may rise to almost $3.73 billion. At the last all-time high of $109,000, the figure may reach $4 billion. Short sellers who sold the market with high leverage are most vulnerable, and the heat is on.\n\nLong Positions Cleared In Earlier Dip\n\nWhile shorts are currently in the crosshairs, long positions already lost some ground. In a recent dip, longs saw much of the bullish bets get washed out. The aggregate leverage that supported long positions has declined drastically, according to the red trendline of long liquidations.\n\nThis leaves fewer overconfident buyers propping up the market, lessening the risk of an abrupt crash from long-side liquidation. The reset also leaves a cleaner path higher, as there is less resistance from leveraged longs attempting to hold their positions.\n\nResistance Zone Between $96K And $98K\n\nBitcoin is now trading within one of its largest resistance zones. On-chain indicators on IntoTheBlock indicate that an estimated 1.06 million wallets purchased approximately 750,800 BTC between the $96K and $98K regions. That’s nearly $73 billion’s worth of Bitcoin at break-even for a good number of holders.\n\nThis region is significant. If Bitcoin manages to break above it, there will be less selling pressure in the way. The price may rise quicker with fewer hurdles between $98K and $100K.\n\n$3B in #Bitcoin shorts will get liquidated at $100K.

The available evidence refutes this assertion. There is no data indicating corn crop losses are or will increase due to changing climate conditions. These dire predictions are based on flawed models, unverified assumptions, and an overreliance on speculative climate scenarios, rather than actual observed data for corn production, which has regularly set new records during the recent period of modest warming.\n\nAs seen below in Figure 1, for over 40 years, average temperatures in the United States have indeed been rising slightly.\n\nFigure 1. United States surface temperature departure from average, 1985-2020. 40 year markers added by A. Watts. Original graph from NOAA.\n\nHowever, this has not resulted in declining agricultural productivity as climate alarmists frequently suggest. In fact, U.S. corn yields have steadily increased over the same period, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data plotted by Purdue University and shown in Figure 2 below.\n\nFigure 2. Annual U.S. Corn Grain Yields and Historical Trends Since 1866. Data derived from annual USDA-NASS Crop Production Reports. USDA data plotted by Purdue University.\n\nThe good news is that according to the USDA data, corn grain yields in the U.S. have steadily increased since the 1950s at a rate of almost 2 bushels per acre per year.\n\nAs detailed in this Climate Realism article, higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations have enhanced photosynthesis, particularly benefiting crops like corn. The USDA reports that corn yields have more than doubled since the 1980s, demonstrating the resilience and adaptability of U.S. agriculture. Improvements in seed genetics, better farming practices, and technology have all contributed, making farmers more capable of handling weather variations than ever before.\n\nThe Hill article leans heavily on projections generated by an “AI-powered tool” created by researchers at UC Berkeley and the University of Arkansas. However, as highlighted by numerous articles on ClimateRealism, including this detailed analysis, climate models have repeatedly failed to accurately predict weather patterns or crop outcomes over time. The notion that insurance claims will spike due to increased extreme weather events is speculative at best, especially considering the fact that data shows no noticeable trend in worsening weather. Extreme weather events of the types that might impact corn production or yields have not become more frequent or severe in recent decades.\n\nThe article’s warnings about “more intense droughts, longer heat waves, and more catastrophic floods” are not supported by current data. As discussed in this post, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other authoritative bodies have found no clear trend in increasing drought frequency or intensity in the United States. Furthermore, flood data also contradicts alarmist claims. There has been no upward trend in flood severity or frequency, nationally.\n\nThe authors’ suggestion to alter farm policy by incentivizing practices like cover cropping and crop rotation might sound appealing, but even they admit these would lower annual yields. Imposing such policies based on speculative climate risks would harm the very farmers they claim to be trying to protect, reducing productivity in the name of theoretical resilience. Essentially policies like this would be incentivizing inefficiency.\n\nAlso, there is no evidence whatsoever that planting cover crops, rotating crops, or other so-called resiliency measures, will avoid losses if droughts or floods do become more frequent or severe. Instead, there would just be insurance payouts for alternative crop losses.\n\nIt’s astonishing that The Hill would publish such an article based on shaky, unverified models without at least checking real-world data trends on agricultural productivity and extreme weather. For over four decades, U.S. farmers have thrived even as temperatures have modestly risen. This editorial exemplifies the poor research and blind acceptance of climate alarmism that too often passes for journalism today. Instead of challenging dubious claims, The Hill parrots them, spreading fear and misinformation to the public.\n\nAnthony Watts\n\nAnthony Watts is a senior fellow for environment and climate at The Heartland Institute.

Sheinbaum responded to the Wall Street Journal article and recounted a recent phone call in which Trump offered military assistance to crack down on trafficking operations.\n\n“He said, ‘How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you.’ And you know what I said to him? ‘No, President Trump,'” Sheinbaum recalled, The Associated Press (AP) reported. “Sovereignty is not for sale. Sovereignty is loved and defended.”\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt later released a statement defending Trump’s position, calling for increased collaboration with Mexico.\n\n“Dangerous Foreign Terrorist Organizations, however, continue to threaten our shared security and the drugs and crime they spread threaten American communities across the country,” the statement said, AP reported. “The President has been crystal clear that Mexico must do more do combat these gangs and cartels and the United States stands ready to assist and expand the already close cooperation between our two countries.”\n\nPresident Trump’s crackdown on drug cartels and his unprecedented pressure on the Mexican government have forced drug lords into retreat. Facing the threat of arrest or death, many cartel operatives have shut down operations and gone into hiding as Mexico steps up efforts against producers of illicit drugs flooding the U.S. border. (RELATED: Trump Says There Is ‘No Room Left’ For Any Negotiations On Postponing Tariffs On Mexico, Canada)\n\nTrump launched a sweeping border crackdown on his first day back in office, signing executive orders that sent U.S. troops to the southern border, resumed wall construction, and designated major drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. His administration also expanded a covert drone surveillance program aimed at detecting fentanyl production sites across Mexico.\n\nThe effort soon became a joint campaign after Trump threatened steep tariffs on all Mexican imports unless the Sheinbaum government cracked down on illegal immigration and narcotics trafficking. In response, Sheinbaum deployed 10,000 national guard troops to her country’s southern border and began coordinating high-profile raids against organized crime.\n\nWith the threats of tariffs, Sheinbaum’s forces have already seized roughly 5 tons of methamphetamine, 453 kilos of cocaine, and 55 kilos of fentanyl since early February. Mexican forces seized $40 million worth of meth and extradited 29 cartel leaders to the U.S., including a longtime fugitive tied to a DEA agent’s 1985 murder.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Smith Says Democrats Are Too Broken For Him To Run For The Party’s Nomination", "fullContent": "ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith ruled out running for president as a Democrat in 2028 during a CNN appearance Sunday, citing dissatisfaction with the party’s current direction.\n\nSmith said he’s keeping “all doors open” for a potential political run, despite admitting he hates the idea of becoming a politician. During an appearance on “State of the Union With Jake Tapper and Dana Bash,” Smith made it clear this week that a 2028 presidential bid under the Democratic banner is off the table, unless the party undergoes a major overhaul.\n\n“You know what? I’m an independent. I’m a registered independent. I would lean, who leans left. I’m fiscally conservative when it comes to my money,” Smith told host Jake Tapper when asked if he’ll run under the Democratic Party. “I’m socially liberal. I’m liberal when it comes to social issues pretty much across the board. I believe in living and let living.”\n\nWhile Smith acknowledged he might hypothetically run as a Democrat if forced to choose, he made clear that such a move is unlikely given the current trajectory of the party.\n\n“So I’m a moderate, and I would say if I had to run, it would be as a Democrat, but I’m not happy with the Democratic Party. So the Democratic Party is presently constructed. It would pretty much need to be purged in order for me to assume that I would want to be associated with them and I would garner their support because I don’t like the way they’ve gone about doing a lot of things for a very, very long period of time,” Smith explained. “And I think that I don’t view Donald Trump as winning the election. I view the Democrats as losing the election, as absolutely positively blowing it with some of their actions.”\n\nWhen asked what exactly the party has done to lose his support, Smith didn’t mince words.\n\nWATCH:\n\n“We know how they go about operating. We know what we lean towards when it came to open borders. We know that the spending was excessive, even though it’s excessive on the Republican side as well. I think a $37 trillion budget when Republicans try to act like it’s just the Democrats, that’s not true, but the Democrats certainly shouldn’t be absolved from blame in that regard,” Smith added.\n\nSmith further criticized the party’s focus on identity politics, excessive government spending, and what he called the psychological damage caused by cancel culture and “woke” ideology. (RELATED: Tim Walz Is Still Trying To Explain How Badly His Party Failed In 2024)\n\n“But certainly with identity politics, woke culture, cancer culture, I thought that that was something that ravaged our nation psychologically. Because you had people literally scared they were going to lose their jobs if they pronounce the wrong pronoun for crying out loud. It got that bad and I think that that’s one of the reasons that Donald Trump is in office today because so much stuff a lot is focused on the individual as opposed to actual policies itself,” Smith noted.\n\nSince the 2024 election, Smith has repeatedly criticized the Democratic Party for its divisive rhetoric and failure to connect with average voters. Smith cast doubt on Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s viability in 2028, citing what he described as a lack of leadership in the state he governs.\n\nDemocrats have struggled to present a unifying message since their 2024 loss, with voters unsure who represents the party’s future. A March CNN/SSRS poll found that over 30% of Americans couldn’t name a Democrat who embodies the party’s core values.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

My daughter was at home, “learning” remotely. His kids were too. Though he had never focused on kids, schools, or medical writing in his previous journalism, he threw himself into a topic that was reshaping his life, producing a series of articles (published here and elsewhere) that together made a forceful case in favor of reopening schools for full-time, in-person instruction.\n\nThough it began as a sometimes unpopular argument, by mid-2021 it would become the default view of all but the most skittish policymakers and public-health officials. Zweig’s important new book, An Abundance of Caution, published by MIT Press, is a declaration of victory of sorts — but mostly he wants to understand the colossal mistake and how it happened so that it never happens again.\n\n“Everything related to kids strongly pointed in one direction,” he writes, revisiting the period with the spirit of a historian, trying to fathom why public-health officials and the media were so frequently suggesting otherwise, and why so many educational systems opted to stay closed for so long.\n\n“I want people to be able to look behind the curtain and gain an understanding of what was happening,” Zweig told me, “versus what most of us were observing as regular citizens.”\n\nThe following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nYou wrote about this issue a lot at the time. Why, years later, did you feel compelled to write a book?\n\nI very early observed my kids just withering away in the gray light of their Chromebooks alone in their bedrooms. And while it seemed reasonable initially to have schools closed, particularly because I’m close to New York City, soon it dawned on me that there was no long-term plan and this was not going to work.\n\nChildhood is achingly brief, and for a little boy or girl who’s 8 years old to miss a year, or even more than a year, of the experience of putting an arm around a friend, of chatting with other kids at lunchtime, of running around in a playground with friends … the idea that that wasn’t a tremendous harm is absurd.\n\nPeople are still missing the larger point here about what was lost.\n\nThe conventional wisdom was that we needed to keep schools closed until it was safe to reopen them, and even then, it could be done only in communities where the spread of the virus had abated and educators took certain concrete steps to keep teachers and kids safe. You’re saying all of that was wrong?\n\nI recognize that intuitively many of these interventions seem like they would be beneficial. School closures in particular and then, more broadly, mask mandates and barriers on desks and six feet of distancing — but the evidence shows none of this did anything.\n\nEuropeans had announced in the spring that there was no observable negative impact to reopening schools, yet for some reason this information was ignored.\n\nPeople like Randi Weingarten, the teachers-union leader, and Dr. Anthony Fauci and others continually said, We really want schools open. This is so important, but we have to do it when it’s safe. And then fake benchmarks were contrived that made it nearly impossible to open them. And fake interventions were contrived that needed to happen even if they opened. At that point, do you really want schools open?\n\nOne of your slightly counterintuitive arguments is that part of the reason many schools stayed closed is because Trump was pushing to open them.\n\nTrump was so reviled by the left that when he announced schools should reopen, he basically ensured they would remain closed. I give a lot of examples in the book of how institutions, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, were very strongly in favor of getting kids into schools, but as soon as Trump came out in favor of reopening, they completely reversed their position. I have lots of other examples of this happening; this was clearly in opposition to Trump.\n\nYou’re also very critical of the news media and the lack of scrutiny applied to claims that keeping schools closed was the right decision. Why do you think that scrutiny was missing?\n\nThis was overdetermined — from incredible political tribalism, to the public-health Establishment perpetuating many things that were untrue, to the media not demanding evidence behind those claims. All of these things led to an environment that made it incredibly difficult to open schools in America when they had already been open in Europe.\n\nThe media reported health officials or self-styled medical pundits (either by name or oftentimes with a generic “experts say” attribution) making these claims about what was necessary to safely reopen schools, yet generally reporters did not push them for evidence or investigate the veracity of the claims. Given that many school districts were unable or unwilling to meet these bogus requirements, the “when it’s safe” qualifier — along with the avalanche of fear-based, anti-scientific reporting in much of the legacy media — ensured the public would remain misinformed and schools in much of the country would remain closed.\n\nThe history of science and medicine is riddled with examples of our intuition being proved wrong. In this case, the public was misled into believing these interventions were necessary and would yield a net benefit, which was untrue.\n\nYet you cite New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg calling for reopening schools. It’s not as if there were some sort of elite consensus.\n\nIt’s very, very clear that the thrust of the legacy media pointed in one direction — particularly our most influential publications. There are academic studies that back this up. Of course, there were some voices that expressed dissent, including mine. But that would be the exception, not the rule.\n\nSo the reopening debate became part of our culture wars.\n\nDoctors at elite institutions, top university hospitals, were contacting me after I started writing articles that were challenging the Establishment position. They would say, Thank you so much. I agree with what you’re saying. I think this is terrible, what’s happening to kids. There is no evidence that this is beneficial. We have evidence that this is harmful. But all these conversations, I was told, needed to be off the record because we had an environment in our country where doctors were afraid to actually share their real view.\n\nWasn’t the villain the virus?\n\nI don’t think a virus can be a villain.\n\nOne argument you make in the book is that a lot of the discourse around the pandemic had to do with equity — but closing schools was anything but an inequitable solution.\n\nThe irony here is that the left fashions itself as the champions of the underprivileged. These are the people who advocated so hard for school closures, which immediately, overtly, and predictably exacerbated the inequities between underprivileged kids and kids with more resources. This is a really important point. It was obvious, it was predictable, and that’s exactly what happened.\n\nThe reason given for doing this was that underprivileged kids were oftentimes believed to be at greater risk from the virus, or their families at greater risk, but there was never any evidence that school closures were going to reduce the likelihood of transmission.\n\nSure enough, that is what the evidence showed very early and continued to show throughout the pandemic.\n\nWhat specifically made remote learning so bad?\n\nThat’s not how children are intended to learn, sitting alone in a room for hours and hours on the screen, for days and then weeks and then months on end. We’re social creatures. We’re meant to interact with each other in person, and remote learning just exacerbated the infiltration of technology in our lives.\n\nAnd there were many, many children in our country who didn’t have access to remote-learning tools to begin with. Millions of kids don’t live in a safe or suitable home environment, or they have special learning, physical, or neurological challenges that make remote learning impossible.\n\nA kindergartner cannot be expected to learn how to read alone. I mean, I could go on and on.\n\nDo you think educators were not entirely honest about how long schools would stay closed, or did they just genuinely not know?\n\nMost of my lens in the book is trained on the public-health Establishment and the media because without those two institutions perpetuating a series of falsehoods, the teachers unions could never even have begun making the various demands regarding things that needed to be done in order for schools to open.\n\nIf we paid teachers more, if schools had working HVAC systems and didn’t have overcrowded classrooms, wouldn’t that have made it easier to reopen?\n\nThere are plenty of schools throughout Europe in old buildings packed with students, and they observed no increase in community rates because of it.\n\nIn the book, I quote an extraordinary manifesto from the L.A. teachers union, which had this fantastical list of demands, including things like special taxes on millionaires and billionaires. There needed to be all sorts of social programs. You couldn’t have charter schools. It was just massively disingenuous.\n\nI’m sorry, but a shitty bathroom with crumbling tiles has nothing to do with the spread of a highly contagious respiratory virus.\n\nWhat do you think is the lasting damage done by school closures?\n\nA lot of attention rightfully has been paid to statistics regarding learning loss, and it is unambiguous that it is directly connected to the proportion of time kids were locked out of school. So that’s super-important, but there are so many harms that can’t be quantified. There are millions of kids around the country who were quietly robbed of their future — and it’s impossible for us to understand the scope of the damage simply by looking at, you know, test scores. And none of it brought any benefit.\n\nDo you think the fact that there was no real accountability has been broadly harmful to our society?\n\nI don’t really know what accountability looks like because the harm that occurred was not something where people were necessarily breaking the law.\n\nYou have this very pleasant scene in the book in which you and other dads are sitting and drinking beer in an empty parking lot. Wasn’t there genuinely a moment when we could have used the pandemic not just to drink more beer with our neighbors, fun as that was, but really to do things differently? Did we miss an opportunity?\n\nLord knows, I tried. There was a wonderful article in the New York Times about kids during the tuberculosis epidemic, when they did outdoor schooling. There were these sepia-toned photos of kids sitting on the roofs of buildings.\n\nI tried to get that going here in my town; this was like in the summer of 2020, saying, Look, I recognize you’re afraid to open the schools. Let’s do outdoor classes. It’s been done in the past. There was word spreading that these large outdoor tents were being bought up by all the private schools, by rich districts. There was this scramble in my mind. I’m like, We have to hurry. Let’s get these tents. Let’s do this.\n\nEven the people who were very afraid of COVID, almost all of them acknowledged that being outdoors was virtually zero risk. This was a way for kids to be able to be back at school with their peers. And I was met with just a brick wall. There was just literally nothing we could say that they wouldn’t have some absurd response for it. For example, one of the reasons given for why we couldn’t have outdoor classes was that some kids might have allergies. Another one was, Well, there’s no security. Kids might run away. Then they said it was a fire hazard. And that’s when I kind of lost my mind. I was like, A fire hazard outdoors? It didn’t — there was nothing, nothing we could say or do.\n\nAnd that’s when I realized they didn’t care about having kids in school. It’s just impossible, the amount of bureaucratic calcification, the way schools seem to run, from the administrators. Almost none of them are leaders. No one wants to be first on anything. Everything is, Well, let’s wait and see what other people are doing. So why didn’t we take this opportunity to make them better? We couldn’t even get them to do an outdoor classroom.\n\nHow do you think the social effects of school closures will continue to reverberate through American society?\n\nIt was just such a radical policy decision that we put into place. I don’t think there’s been sufficient attention paid to this. But given how extraordinary this was, to some extent, people just kind of memory-holed it. Things like 9/11 or the Iraq War, things like the 2008 financial crisis or Enron, those involve villains that the left can easily vilify, whereas the villain in regards to this stuff was the Establishment.\n\nAre you optimistic that officials will handle the next pandemic better when it comes to school closures?\n\nI think a significant portion of the public just simply won’t tolerate it the way they did last time."}

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be two business days before the record date, which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase KSB SE KGaA's shares on or after the 9th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of May.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be €26.50 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of €26.50 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that KSB SE KGaA has a trailing yield of 3.1% on the current share price of €845.00.

We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nWe've discovered 1 warning sign about KSB SE KGaA. View them for free.\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately KSB SE KGaA's payout ratio is modest, at just 39% of profit. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 34% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for KSB SE KGaA\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nXTRA:KSB Historic Dividend May 4th 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see KSB SE KGaA's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 22% per annum for the past five years. KSB SE KGaA is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings."}

Read for free now.\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Orell Füssli AG (VTX:OFN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 36% stake, retail investors possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nPublic companies, on the other hand, account for 33% of the company's stockholders.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Orell Füssli.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Orell Füssli\n\nSWX:OFN Ownership Breakdown May 4th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Orell Füssli?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Orell Füssli. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Orell Füssli, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nSWX:OFN Earnings and Revenue Growth May 4th 2025\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Orell Füssli. Our data shows that Schweizerische Nationalbank is the largest shareholder with 33% of shares outstanding. Dieter Meier is the second largest shareholder owning 13% of common stock, and Meerbusch Siegert holds about 8.5% of the company stock.\n\nTo make our study more interesting, we found that the top 3 shareholders have a majority ownership in the company, meaning that they are powerful enough to influence the decisions of the company.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There is a little analyst coverage of the stock, but not much. So there is room for it to gain more coverage."}

Typically, the ex-dividend date is two business days before the record date, which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase MTU Aero Engines' shares before the 9th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 13th of May.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is €2.20 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of €2.20 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that MTU Aero Engines has a trailing yield of 0.7% on the current share price of €319.00. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether MTU Aero Engines's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nWe check all companies for important risks. See what we found for MTU Aero Engines in our free report.\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. MTU Aero Engines is paying out just 19% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year, it paid out dividends equivalent to 263% of what it generated in free cash flow, a disturbingly high percentage. It's pretty hard to pay out more than you earn, so we wonder how MTU Aero Engines intends to continue funding this dividend, or if it could be forced to cut the payment.\n\nWhile MTU Aero Engines's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were MTU Aero Engines to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.\n\nSee our latest analysis for MTU Aero Engines\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."}

Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Braime Group's earnings per share have been growing at 11% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later."}

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Pro-Dex (NASDAQ:PDEX). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nPro-Dex's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Pro-Dex's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 48%. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Pro-Dex is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.2 percentage points to 18%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\n\nNasdaqCM:PDEX Earnings and Revenue History May 4th 2025\n\nSee our latest analysis for Pro-Dex\n\nSince Pro-Dex is no giant, with a market capitalisation of US$150m, you should definitely check its cash and debt before getting too excited about its prospects.\n\nAre Pro-Dex Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nPrior to investment, it's always a good idea to check that the management team is paid reasonably. Pay levels around or below the median, can be a sign that shareholder interests are well considered. For companies with market capitalisations under US$200m, like Pro-Dex, the median CEO pay is around US$663k.\n\nPro-Dex offered total compensation worth US$441k to its CEO in the year to June 2024. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally."}

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least one business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Sound Financial Bancorp's shares before the 9th of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of May.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.19 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.76 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Sound Financial Bancorp stock has a trailing yield of around 1.5% on the current share price of US$51.33.

Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Sound Financial Bancorp's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 5.8% a year over the previous five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Sound Financial Bancorp has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Sound Financial Bancorp? Earnings per share have shrunk noticeably in recent years, although we like that the company has a low payout ratio. This could suggest a cut to the dividend may not be a major risk in the near future. At best we would put it on a watch-list to see if business conditions improve, as it doesn't look like a clear opportunity right now."}

Penny stocks, while often considered a niche segment of the market, continue to offer intriguing opportunities for investors seeking growth at accessible price points.

The ex-dividend date is two business days before a company's record date in most cases, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Focusrite's shares before the 8th of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 9th of June.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be UK£0.021 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of UK£0.066 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Focusrite has a trailing yield of 4.7% on the current stock price of UK£1.40. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Focusrite can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Focusrite distributed an unsustainably high 195% of its profit as dividends to shareholders last year. Without extenuating circumstances, we'd consider the dividend at risk of a cut. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Focusrite generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 25% of its cash flow last year.\n\nIt's disappointing to see that the dividend was not covered by profits, but cash is more important from a dividend sustainability perspective, and Focusrite fortunately did generate enough cash to fund its dividend. If executives were to continue paying more in dividends than the company reported in profits, we'd view this as a warning sign. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Focusrite\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."}

(NYSE:AWI) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 3 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least one business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Armstrong World Industries' shares on or after the 8th of May, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 22nd of May.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.308 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.23 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Armstrong World Industries has a trailing yield of approximately 0.8% on its current stock price of US$149.93. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.\n\nOur free stock report includes 1 warning sign investors should be aware of before investing in Armstrong World Industries. Read for free now.\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Armstrong World Industries paid out just 19% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Armstrong World Industries generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 27% of its free cash flow in the past year.\n\nIt's positive to see that Armstrong World Industries's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nView our latest analysis for Armstrong World Industries\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNYSE:AWI Historic Dividend May 4th 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Armstrong World Industries, with earnings per share up 4.9% on average over the last five years. Recent earnings growth has been limited. However, companies that see their growth slow can often choose to pay out a greater percentage of earnings to shareholders, which could see the dividend continue to rise."}
