It seemingly started with this New York Post article. The basic message: “Apple warns users to delete Chrome from their iPhones immediately.” If true, that would indeed be huge news. But the real details are more complicated and nuanced.\n\nApple’s Safari marketing warns against competing browsers\n\nApple has long maintained user privacy as being a core part of its values. This shows up in its branding and advertising too.\n\nFor example, last summer Apple debuted a new ad campaign for Safari that emphasized the browser’s privacy features.\n\nUsing the tagline, “Your browsing is being watched,” the campaign’s main video presented other browsers as being like surveillance cameras with wings, following you around everywhere.\n\n“Flock” has currently racked up nearly 20 million views, and counting.\n\nThe ad not-so-subtly takes aim at market leader Chrome.\n\nFor example, here’s a Safari-Chrome comparison chart Apple provided to media:\n\nWhy the Safari ad has resurfaced now\n\nIf Apple’s “Flock” video came out nearly a year ago, why is it getting fresh attention now?\n\nIt’s resurfaced due to a recent Google announcement regarding Chrome.\n\nLast year, only six days after the Safari video went live, Google announced some changes it was “proposing” regarding how third-party tracking happens in Chrome.\n\nEssentially, some of the privacy concerns Apple’s ad highlighted were being addressed.\n\nExcept this past week, Google reversed course and said it’s not making the Chrome changes after all. Instead, “we’ve made the decision to maintain our current approach to offering users third-party cookie choice in Chrome, and will not be rolling out a new standalone prompt for third-party cookies.”\n\nWhy the change? Per the full post:\n\nthe adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies has accelerated, new opportunities to safeguard and secure people’s browsing experiences with AI have emerged, and the regulatory landscape around the world has evolved considerably\n\nBasically, Google no longer thinks the changes are necessary—and it’s concerned about regulatory issues like those Apple has faced for its privacy efforts. Additionally, Google says “it remains clear that there are divergent perspectives on making changes that could impact the availability of third-party cookies”.\n\nGoogle’s about-face on its proposed changes has led the Safari video to re-surface across the web, and articles like The Post’s to be written.\n\nApple’s Chrome warning: wrap-up\n\nIn conclusion, did Apple really warn users to delete Chrome from their iPhones? Not officially, no.\n\nApple continues to be a major partner with Google, including making its search engine the default in Safari. So the chances of Apple directly telling users to delete Chrome are extremely slim.\n\nBut certainly, Apple’s ad campaign last summer did suggest iPhone users who care about their privacy should use Safari instead.\n\nAnd it probably wouldn’t be a bad idea for Apple to capitalize on Google’s recent reversal by putting together a new Safari ad for a moment like this.\n\nBest iPhone accessories"}

Here's a timeline of the singer's controversies.", "fullContent": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAt the dawn of a new decade, Lana Del Rey seemed poised at the summit of the indie-pop mountain.\n\nThe songstress, now 39, was still riding the high of \"Norman Fucking Rockwell!\" — her career-topping sixth album, which was crowned as Pitchfork's best of 2019 and nominated for album of the year at the Grammy Awards.\n\nAs 2019 neared its close, Del Rey's first two albums, \"Born to Die\" and \"Ultraviolence,\" both landed on several decade-end lists. She was named one of the decade's defining artists by Business Insider.\n\nBut shortly after, Del Rey's behavior began to make more headlines than her music.\n\nHer reputation suffered a rapid downturn, thanks to a string of controversial public statements, questionable accessories, and a strong tendency to double down.\n\nMany fans even said they'd \"lost respect\" for the singer, and she became increasingly described online as a \"problematic white woman.\" More recently, Del Rey has faced backlash for leaning into what listeners have described as a \"conservative Southerner vibe\" with her music, aesthetics, and inner circle.\n\nKeep reading for a timeline of her biggest scandals and inflammatory comments.\n\nNote: This article has been updated since its original publish date.\n\nMay 2020: Del Rey posted an unprompted public statement about her own reputation\n\nIt all began on May 21, four months after the 2020 Grammys, when Del Rey shared a lengthy open letter on Instagram.\n\nPosed as a \"question for the culture,\" Del Rey praised her own legacy and broadly described her critics as \"pathetic.\"\n\n\"Now that Doja Cat, Ariana, Camila, Cardi B, Kehlani and Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé have had number ones with songs about being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating etc,\" she wrote, \"can I please go back to singing about being embodied, feeling beautiful by being in love even if the relationship is not perfect, or dancing for money, or whatever I want, without being crucified or saying that I'm glamorizing abuse?\"\n\n\"I'm fed up with female writers and alt singers saying that I glamorize abuse,\" she continued, \"when in reality I'm just a glamorous person singing about the realities of what we are all now seeing are very prevalent emotionally abusive relationships all over the world.\"\n\nShe defended writing songs about being \"submissive\" in relationships, despite what she described as \"a long 10 years of bullshit reviews.\"\n\n\"I also feel it really paved the way for other women to stop 'putting on a happy face' and to just be able to say whatever the hell they wanted to in their music,\" she wrote, \"unlike my experience where if I even expressed a note of sadness in my first two records I was deemed literally hysterical as though it was literally the 1920s.\"\n\nDel Rey concluded her statement by plugging her forthcoming poetry books, mentioning that she donates to \"Native American foundations,\" and announcing a new album.\n\nIt remains unclear what triggered Del Rey's statement, or why she felt compelled to defend her music after months of glowing reviews.\n\nEarly in her career, Del Rey was seen as a controversial figure, but largely due to accusations of inauthenticity and artifice — especially because she orchestrated an aesthetic pivot after releasing a \"flop\" album under her birth name, Lizzy Grant.\n\nDel Rey's tragic-glam persona that she introduced in the \"Born To Die\" era, which leaned heavily on images of white Americana, received far more scrutiny than her lyrics. She was also criticized in 2014 for telling Fader, \"Feminism is just not an interesting concept.\"\n\nDel Rey may have been reacting to a 2019 article from The Independent, in which writer Helen Brown \"examines how easy it is to misread her lyrics as 'antifeminist'\" — although Brown actually defends Del Rey's \"sharp\" songwriting and roundly praises her newest album.\n\nWhatever Del Rey's motivations may have been, her 2020 statement was poorly received.\n\nWhile some agreed she's been unfairly judged as \"antifeminist\" in the past, many were angry that she name-dropped other artists to make her point.\n\nAdditionally, six out of the seven people she mentioned were women of color, which sparked accusations of racism.\n\nAs Tulane University's Christine Capetola wrote, in addition to her reductive descriptions of their music, Del Rey \"failed to recognize Black female artists' decades-long — and ongoing — struggle to express their sexualities on their own terms within the realm of pop music.\"\n\nDel Rey also implied that she's more \"delicate\" than her peers, and claimed that feminism is intolerant of \"women who look and act like me.\"\n\n\"The optics of Lana, a white woman, complaining about feminism lacking space for her while critiquing the acclaim allotted to several Black pop artists is mortifying,\" Ashley Reese wrote for Jezebel.\n\n—Black Fat Queer (@FlamingFatQueer) May 21, 2020\n\nYouTuber D'Angelo Wallace said Del Rey's album announcement was amplified by media coverage of the controversy.\n\n\"Was Lana Del Rey profiting off Black outrage to sell her album? Yes,\" he said in a video titled, \"Lana Del Rey has Lana Del LOST IT.\"\n\n\"I don't think she did it on purpose,\" he said. \"But once she realized who she was making mad, and that it was getting her even more attention than she initially was looking for, she made four follow-up comments. And they were all about the outrage.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm just gonna be honest. This is where my respect for her started to dip.\"\n\nShortly after, Del Rey doubled down and insisted she's not racist\n\nDel Rey's response to the backlash focused on her reasoning for naming specific artists.\n\n\"To be clear because I knowwww you love to twist things. I fucking love these singers and know them. #that is why I mentioned them,\" she wrote. \"I would like to have some of the same freedom of expression without judgment of hysteria.\"\n\n\"I haven't had the same opportunity to express what I wanted to express without being completely decimated,\" she continued in a second comment. \"And if you want to say that has something to do with race that's your opinion but that's not what I was saying.\"\n\n\"This is the problem with society today,\" she said in a third comment. \"It's exactly the point of my post — there are certain women that culture doesn't want to have a voice it may not have to do with race I don't know what it has to do with.\"\n\n\"I don't care anymore but don't ever ever ever ever bro- call me racist because that is bullshit.\"\n\n\"And my last and final note on everything,\" Del Rey wrote in a fourth comment, \"when I said people who look like me — I meant the people who don't look strong or necessarily smart, or like they're in control etc. it's about advocating for a more delicate personality, not for white women — thanks for the Karen comments tho. V helpful.\"\n\nHowever, Del Rey's comments struck many people as overly defensive, tone-deaf, and unproductive, rather than illuminating.\n\n\"'Don't ever call me racist' is hands-down the single-most disappointing reaction to accusations of racism,\" Wallace said in his video.\n\nyeah when you offend a group of ppl, even if it wasn’t your intent..this is not the right response.\n\nwhy is so hard to just say “i hear you, i apologize for how my statement made you guys feel, it was never my intentions, i just wanted to shed light on blank” and keep it moving https://t.co/2WSbRE4V8z — lady gaga’s defense attorney (@codistweets) May 22, 2020\n\nBlack writers like Nichole Perkins and Roxane Gay also pointed out Del Rey's use of \"coded\" language and self-victimization.\n\nSo the women that she mentioned previously cannot be delicate? The narrative of the \"strong black woman\" that ultimately prevents us from being allowed to display any sort of vulnerability is just another racist bias she doesn't realize she has... She needs to stop talking asap — carioca in training (@imanarchy_) May 21, 2020\n\nDel Rey posted an additional statement on Instagram, accusing her critics of wanting a 'race war'\n\nOne day after her original post, Del Rey continued to insist that it \"wasn't controversial at all,\" despite national news coverage and widespread backlash.\n\nIn her additional statement, she implied that Ariana Grande and Doja Cat reached out to express discomfort with her message.\n\nBut \"despite the feedback,\" Del Rey doubled down once again.\n\n\"I want to say that I remain firm in my clarity and stance in that what i was writing about was the importance of self-advocacy for the more delicate and often dismissed, softer female personality, and that there does have to be room for that type in what will inevitably become a new wave/3rd wave of feminism that is rapidly approaching,\" she wrote, even though the third wave of feminism began more than 20 years ago.\n\n\"I'm sorry that the folks who I can only assume are super Trump/Pence supporters or hyper liberals or flip-flopping headline grabbing critics can't read and want to make it a race war,\" she continued.\n\nShe also accused her female critics of being \"disassociated from their own fragility and sexuality\" and wanting \"drama.\"\n\n\"My aim and my message are clear. That I have control of my own story,\" she concluded. \"If the women I mention don't wanna be associated with me that's absolutely fine by me.\"\n\nAgain, fans criticized Del Rey for dismissing feedback rather than engaging with it.\n\nMany noted that Del Rey's repeated self-characterization as a \"delicate\" woman plays into racist stereotypes, which historically paint white women as more feminine or fragile — allowing them to escape accountability more easily.\n\nIt also highlights the idea that Del Rey is \"playing the victim.\"\n\n\"Lana really wants to act like she's the most original artist playing the victim and honestly she's full of shit,\" one person wrote on X (then known as Twitter).\n\nShe was also mocked for not-so-casually plugging her poetry book in the midst of her non-apology.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nDel Rey made a further attempt to defend her open letter 3 days later — and compared herself to another woman of color\n\n\"In that post — my one and only personal declaration I've ever made, thanks for being so warm and welcoming — was about the need for fragility in the feminist movement,\" Del Rey said on May 25 in a six-minute video on Instagram.\n\n\"When I mentioned women who 'look like me,' I didn't mean white like me, I mean the kind of women who, you know, other people might not believe,\" Del Rey said in the video. \"The difference is, when I get on the pole, people call me a whore, but when twigs gets on the pole, it's art.\"\n\nShe added: \"The culture is super sick right now. And the fact that they wanna turn my post, my advocacy for fragility, into a race war — it's really bad. It's actually really bad.\"\n\nShe also expressed frustration that her letter received backlash, though she didn't address any of the specific criticism she received from artists and fans of color.\n\n\"It really, again, makes you reach into the depth of your own heart and say, 'Am I good-intentioned?' And of course, for me, the answer is always yes,\" she said. \"I barely ever share a thing, and this is why.\"\n\nDel Rey wrapped up by insisting that she's \"not racist,\" plugging her poetry books, and refusing to apologize for her original statement: \"Fuck off if you don't like the post.\"\n\nOnce again, Del Rey was perceived as being resentful towards successful women of color, ignorant of her own privilege, and determined to play the victim.\n\nPeople were especially infuriated by Del Rey's mention of FKA twigs, a mixed-race singer, songwriter, and dancer.\n\nTwigs has trained as a pole dancer and incorporated acrobatics into her art, as in her Grammy-nominated music video for \"Cellophane.\" She has also incorporated the skill into live performances of \"Magdalene,\" an album that explores the demonization of women throughout history and her own experiences with heartbreak and trauma.\n\nTwigs also said that pole dancing helped her feel like her \"strong self again\" after she had six fibroid tumors removed from her uterus in 2018.\n\nFor her part, Del Rey portrayed a stripper in her 2013 short film for \"Tropico,\" which was criticized for \"appropriating Latino gangster culture.\"\n\n\"The fact that she said race war and doesn't see twigs as a fragile, delicate woman is... You're really making it worse,\" one person wrote.\n\nAnother added: \"You can hear FKA twigs' pain on 'Magdalene' period. I need Lana to stop bringing black women into her argument for creating a brand she cannot escape from.\"\n\nMost fans (and former fans at this point) agreed that Del Rey's video \"only made things worse.\"\n\n\"I didn't think she was this kind of person,\" Wallace said in his video. \"Now I have the knowledge that Lana Del Rey is kind of ruthless in her pursuit of getting people to talk about her, and she doesn't seem to care who gets angry in the process, or even if what she's saying is right. So, that's a lot.\"\n\nJune 2020: She was called out by Black artists for sharing videos of protesters\n\nDuring the wave of Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, Del Rey shared two videos on Instagram.\n\nAccording to Billboard, the first video showed a man holding a sign that read \"no justice no peace,\" while the second showed people breaking into storefronts and running away with merchandise. She disabled comments on the post.\n\nOn X, Kehlani implored Del Rey to remove the videos because they showed uncensored faces and identifying features, which could lead to \"dangerous\" consequences for the protesters.\n\n\".@LanaDelRey please remove your instagram post it's dangerous as fuck and a very poor choice of moments to post,\" Kehlani tweeted. \"by all means protest, but DO NOT endanger people with your very massive platform. oh and turn your fuckin comments on man.\"\n\nKehlani added: \"it's about furthering endangering the lives of black people. it's about responsibility.\"\n\nTinashe echoed Kehlani's comments in a tweet of her own.\n\n\"@LanaDelRey why the fuck are you posting people looting stores on your page literally WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM,\" she wrote.\n\nAfter Del Rey removed the video from Instagram, Kehlani and Tinashe both deleted their tweets.\n\nOctober 2020: Del Rey came under fire after apparently wearing a mesh face mask\n\nAside from postponing her album, which was originally slated for release in September 2020, Del Rey remained fairly quiet in the wake of her divisive video — except to promote her aforementioned poetry book, \"Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass.\"\n\nIn October, Del Rey hosted a book signing at a Barnes & Noble in Los Angeles during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn videos and photos from the event, she appeared to wear a mesh-style face mask, which, according to the CDC's recommendations, would not effectively barrier respiratory droplets.\n\nFans left comments on her Instagram posts, which she has since deleted, begging her to wear a \"real mask.\"\n\n\"I love you sis but please wear a real mask, it gives a bad message,\" one user commented on Del Rey's Instagram video.\n\n\"i love lana sm but what the frick is she doing ? the covid situation in the united states is worsening and she refuses to wear a proper mask, that really infuriates me,\" another fan wrote on X. \"so many ppl have died there.\"\n\nOthers called Del Rey \"selfish\" and said they were growing tired of defending her.\n\nLana Del Rey is the perfect example of what being an ignorant problematic white woman does to you.... it ages you 40x older. 2019 Vs. 2020. pic.twitter.com/T65SVaKqLO — Jasmine (@jasmineflwrr) October 4, 2020\n\nThe image of COVID-19 slipping through the holes in her mask also became a meme on social media.\n\nDel Rey later said that her mask had a plastic lining, in response to a critical article in the Michigan Daily.\n\n\"The mask had plastic on the inside,\" Del Rey wrote. \"They're commonly sewn in by stylists these days. I don't generally respond to articles because I don't care. But there ya go. Same goes for everyone's masks in my video. I'm lucky enough to have a team of people who can do that.\"\n\nShe also seemed to poke fun at the controversy in her music video for \"Chemtrails Over the Country Club,\" in which she dons a nearly identical mask.\n\nLana Del Rey in \"Chemtrails Over the Country Club.\" Lana Del Rey/YouTube\n\nJanuary 10, 2021: Del Rey unveiled the cover art for her new album — and preemptively defended it with a 'problematic' comment\n\nThe black-and-white cover for \"Chemtrails Over the Country Club\" shows Del Rey grinning and surrounded by friends, all huddled around a table.\n\nShortly after she shared the image, Del Rey commented on her own Instagram post with preemptive self-defense.\n\n\"No this was not intended — these are my best friends, since you are asking today,\" she wrote, although it's unclear who was asking. (This was written as a stand-alone comment, not a reply to anyone in particular.)\n\n\"As it happens when it comes to my amazing friends and this cover, yes, there are people of color on this record's picture and that's all I'll say about that,\" she wrote. \"We are all a beautiful mix of everything - some more than others, which is visible and celebrated in everything I do.\"\n\n\"In 11 years working I have always been extremely inclusive without trying to,\" she continued. \"My best friends are rappers, my boyfriends have been rappers. My dearest friends have been from all over the place, so before you make comments again about a WOC/POC issue, I'm not the one storming the capital, I'm literally changing the world by putting my life and thoughts and love out there on the table 24 seven. Respect it.\"\n\nThe following day, during an interview with BBC's Annie Mac, Del Rey said that \"actually half the people in this photo are people of color.\"\n\n\"I just feel like if that's really what people are gonna say, I have an answer for them, which is that if you look closer, you will see people of color,\" she added. \"It's a black-and-white image, so zoom in, you know. It's just weird, you know?\"\n\nNaturally, some people did make jokes about the cover's perceived lack of diversity, while others called the image \"tone deaf.\"\n\nBut the real backlash came in response to Del Rey's comment, which was described as \"textbook white fragility problematic white woman.\"\n\nDel Rey's note about befriending and dating \"rappers\" was particularly provocative, since it implies that \"rappers\" is an ethnic category and reinforces the notion that Black friends can inoculate white people against racism.\n\nDel Rey was also mocked for claiming that she's \"literally changing the world\" with her writing.\n\n\"We love her and understand her intentions but we cannot keep defending this shit,\" one fan commented on Del Rey's Instagram post. \"That comment is so problematic in so many ways.\"\n\n\"I literally have her lyrics tattooed on my body but I'm also a political activist and I cannot defend this shit at all. I wish we could be excited about the album and only that but shit like this makes it hard to be,\" the fan continued. \"Nothing about her statement is okay.\"\n\n\"If she's going to breathe life into [the] aesthetics of a time where racism was at one of its peaks, and not use her platform in the same breath to advocate today's issues properly, accurately, and tactfully. That's an issue.\"\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nJanuary 11, 2021: Del Rey was criticized for saying Trump 'doesn't know that he's inciting a riot'\n\nDuring an interview with BBC's Annie Mac, Del Rey compared President Donald Trump to \"people who didn't know they hurt other people.\"\n\n\"You know, he doesn't know that he's inciting a riot, and I believe that,\" she said, adding that Trump has \"delusions of grandeur.\"\n\nDel Rey was referring to the violent riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, when pro-Trump supporters stormed the building after attending a nearby Trump rally.\n\nFive people died, and the outgoing president was impeached for \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n\n\"The madness of Trump… As bad as it was, it really needed to happen. We really needed a reflection of our world's greatest problem, which is not climate change but sociopathy and narcissism,\" she said, per Complex. \"Especially in America. It's going to kill the world. It's not capitalism, it's narcissism.\"\n\nOne person replied on X: \"Lana stans gonna be doing some mental gymnastics to explain this one.\"\n\nDel Rey then lashed out at 'larger magazines' for 'taking my well-intentioned and believe it or not liberal comments out of context'\n\nThe day following her interview with Mac, Del Rey responded to Complex's coverage of her comments.\n\n\"OK complex not that our 10 year relationship matters I guess,\" she wrote in a since-deleted post on Twitter, now X. \"Thanks for the cool soundbite taken out of context, I said that the bigger problem is Sociopathy-so whether he meant to incite a riot is less important than the larger issue in America at hand -the problem of sociopathy.\"\n\n\"It's fucked up,\" she continued. \"You know I'm real. You know I voted for Biden. I'm super steady in everything I've ever said. You probably listened to my entire interview. So whoever wrote this is a genuine piece of shit. I am the one helping bringing the problem with narcissism to light.\"\n\nHardly one to stifle momentum, Del Rey also responded to the Australian blog Tone Deaf, which had published an article criticizing the defense of her album cover.\n\n\"I'm actually not tone deaf, I don't think there's anything tone deaf about responding to questions about why there are only white women on a album cover when that's just not the case,\" she tweeted. \"I'm not gonna let people say that some thing is what it isn't. You're jealous I get it.\"\n\nIn an additional (now-deleted) tweet, Del Rey added that her new music is \"great\" and described herself as \"one of the only artists who is genuine.\"\n\nDel Rey continued tweeting about her BBC interview, clarifying that she meant to criticize Trump's \"significant lack of empathy\" and \"the issue of sociopathy and narcissism in America.\"\n\n\"I'll say it again I don't appreciate the larger magazines taking my well-intentioned and believe it or not liberal comments out of context,\" she wrote. \"It's actually what I sing about quite often. It's what I've been condemned for saying.\"\n\nShe also expressed disdain for negative publicity, citing her \"long term relationship\" with magazines like Complex and Rolling Stone, calling the former \"pathetic.\"\n\nUproxx's Steven Hyden described the now-deleted tweet as \"a hilarious and illuminating snapshot of pop-star brain.\"\n\nIndeed, Del Rey has lashed out at journalists and music critics in the past.\n\nBack in September 2019, she tweeted her displeasure with Ann Powers' review of \"Norman Fucking Rockwell!\" for NPR — even though Powers described the album as \"instantly compelling, a pro asserting her future spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\"\n\nTrue to form, Del Rey doubled down with a video, in which she defended her comments about Trump and called out Complex again.\n\n\"I just wanna talk about a couple of things, some of the articles that are coming out today, about me thinking that Trump didn't mean to incite the riots,\" she began. \"I think it's cute that that's the little takeaway that Complex gets from that — especially with our relationship over the last 10 years, obviously completely disregarded.\"\n\n\"I get it. I have something to say, and I don't just show up giggling and talking about my hair and my makeup,\" she continued. \"I was asked directly political questions for over 40 minutes by the BBC Radio 1, and I answered them.\"\n\nMany people saw Del Rey's tweets as another attempt to play the victim or another example of \"white feminism.\" The term is used to describe performative activism that centers white people in the fight for equality, as opposed to intersectionality.\n\n\"Lana is beyond parody,\" one person wrote. \"People are saying she's the epitome of white woman feminism and she defends herself with more white woman feminism.\"\n\nOthers simply made jokes or said they'd lost patience with Del Rey's antics.\n\nSeptember 12, 2021: Del Rey deactivated her social media accounts\n\nIn a black-and-white video posted on Instagram, the musician thanked fans for their support and announced her decision to delete social media.\n\n\"I just wanted to let you know that tomorrow we are going to be deactivating my social media accounts, and that is simply because I have so many other interests and other jobs I'm doing that require privacy and transparency,\" Del Rey said.\n\n\"I'm still very present and love what I do. I'm absolutely here for the music. I'm also just going on some different endeavors and I want to say thank you so much for all the support and I do hope that you like the record,\" she added, referencing her eighth album \"Blue Banisters,\" which was released later that same month.\n\nDel Rey later became active again on Instagram, using the account handle @honeymoon, though her X account remains inactive.\n\nMarch 24, 2023: She included a megachurch pastor's sermon on her new album, dividing fans\n\nOn Del Rey's ninth studio album, \"Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd,\" track five is titled \"Judah Smith Interlude.\"\n\nThe four-minute track gives an uninterrupted platform to Judah Smith, a preacher at the Christian megachurch Churchome. Smith, Del Rey, and producer Jack Antonoff are all listed as cowriters.\n\nDel Rey also thanked Smith in a Facebook post a few months prior, \"for giving me good guidance\" and \"for letting me record a part of his sermon for this record.\"\n\nIn the song, Smith denounces \"a life dominated with lust\" and praises God as \"the fascinating artist who fashioned it all.\"\n\n\"The Spirit of God says, 'I'll infuse you with desirеs for what you have and what's in front of you,'\" Smith preaches.\n\nAs Them previously reported, many fans — especially those who identify as queer — were divided in their reactions to \"Judah Smith Interlude.\" One X user called it \"creepy,\" while another said, \"it's giving conversion therapy cult leader.\"\n\nIndeed, Smith has reportedly made homophobic comments in the past. According to Marie Claire, he called homosexuality a sin comparable to \"murder, rape, or living with your girlfriend\" during a 2005 interview. (The interview in question isn't available online.)\n\nChurchome is also associated with Hillsong, an Australian megachurch best known for attracting famous followers like Chris Pratt. In fact, Justin Bieber once led worship at Churchome, and Smith was featured on Bieber's 2021 EP \"Freedom.\"\n\nHillsong has long been associated with anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ views. A report from NPR described it as \"an ultra-conservative church with a dark past,\" including connections to pedophilia.\n\n\"I was uncomfortable. I'm not religious and thought it was weird to include. Considering who he is, it's very weird,\" one person wrote on Reddit. Another agreed, reasoning that Del Rey could have invented \"a weird fake religious monologue\" instead of \"publicizing a real pastor that sucks.\"\n\nHowever, some fans of Del Rey have defended \"Judah Smith Interlude\" as satirical or \"ironic.\" As Coleman Spilde wrote for the Daily Beast, \"Del Rey is exactly the type of person who would attend a celebrity-studded mega-church, both for a cleansing of the soul and to lambaste its intrinsic flamboyance with her friends.\"\n\n\"As a gay atheist that grew up in the Catholic Church, y'all are really bent out of shape over this,\" another fan commented in a Reddit thread. \"I love how provocative this whole thing is and it's exactly why I love Lana.\"\n\nJune 24, 2023: Del Rey arrived 30 minutes late to the stage at Glastonbury, telling the crowd, 'My hair takes so long to do'\n\nLana Del Rey performs at Glastonbury Festival. Joseph Okpako/WireImage\n\nDel Rey is far from the only artist who's been late to headline a major festival. However, some people were frustrated with the explanation she gave for the delay.\n\n\"I was so fucking late that I am about to rush this set today,\" she told the crowd. \"If they cut power, they cut power. I'm super fucking sorry. My hair takes so long to do. I love you to death. Let's keep on running the set as it's supposed to go.\"\n\nAs a result, Del Rey's microphone was cut off due to the festival's strict midnight curfew — although she encouraged the crowd to sing her final song, \"Video Games,\" instead.\n\nDespite some outrage directed at Glastonbury, many fans blamed Del Rey and said she lacked respect for the fans who came to see her perform.\n\nOthers described her performance as \"chaotic\" and \"disappointing.\"\n\nSeptember 26, 2024: Del Rey married Jeremy Dufrene, an alligator tour guide based in Louisiana\n\nAbout one month after Del Rey and Dufrene sparked romance rumors, paparazzi photos surfaced of the singer wearing a white gown at a public bayou in Des Allemandes, Louisiana.\n\nPeople quickly confirmed that Del Rey and Dufrene tied the knot in the same place where Dufrene operates his swamp boat tours.\n\n\"Jeremy is the one and only. And amazing. And we're very happy,\" Del Rey later wrote on Instagram.\n\nFans were shocked and confused by the news of Del Rey's nuptials. For many, her marriage to Dufrene confirmed their suspicions that she has embraced a conservative lifestyle; unverified screenshots from Dufrene's public Facebook that appear to show support for Trump throughout the 2024 election. (Dufrene's social media accounts have since been set to private.)\n\nNearly three months after her wedding, Del Rey praised her husband as an \"honest partner who has no skin in the game\" during a speech at the Variety Hitmakers ceremony.\n\n\"It's super nerve-racking to have to hold onto an innocent perception of how things could go when you're in an industry where maybe your values or your morals don't quite match up with what's going on — especially when people think that you probably don't have any morals or values,\" she said, per Billboard.\n\nResharing a clip of her speech on X, Meghan McCain wrote: \"Lana is code talking about being a conservative woman here. I know what I speak of.\"\n\nLana is code talking about being a conservative woman here. I know what I speak of. https://t.co/PLPUdjcSlu — Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) December 8, 2024\n\nApril 25, 2025: Del Rey sang about kissing Morgan Wallen during her Stagecoach debut\n\nDel Rey debuted several unreleased songs during her first-ever performance at Stagecoach, California's biggest country music festival.\n\nOne song, titled \"57.5,\" includes an intimate lyric about the country musician Morgan Wallen, whose rise to fame has been marked by a string of arrests and scandals.\n\n\"I kissed Morgan Wallen / I guess kissing me kind of went to his head,\" Del Rey sang. \"If you want my secret to success / I suggest don't go ATVing with him when you're out West.\"\n\nBefore delivering the lyric, Del Rey warned the crowd, \"This is the last time I'm ever gonna say this line.\"\n\n💬 Lana Del Rey shades Morgan Wallen:\n\n\n\n“I kissed Morgan Wallen… I guess, kissing me kinda went to his head.” pic.twitter.com/CDvRj8kCMC — Season Of Lana (@SeasonOfLana) April 26, 2025\n\nDel Rey's name-dropping of Wallen inspired a flurry of mixed reactions. Although the song depicts their encounter in a negative light, which many fans relished as juicy gossip, Del Rey seemed to know that willingly associating herself with Wallen — who's best known in liberal circles for flouting COVID-19 protocols and using a racial slur on camera — would invite attention, speculation, and possibly even backlash.\n\n\"Every couple months Lana has to remind y'all she's a conservative,\" one detractor wrote on X. Other posts referred to her as a \"secret Republican\" and \"MAGA Del Rey.\" Over on Reddit, self-proclaimed former fans lamented the progression of her songwriting (\"This can't be the same woman that wrote 'Cruel World'\") and her recently countrified aesthetic (\"This whole trad wife southern cosplay isn't really for me\").\n\nLDR10 singles are horrible, visuals are horrible, released a song about kissing morgan wallen, every song is flopping, and everyone is unstanning lana. we truly won pic.twitter.com/QeCXXkJafk — blec (@bleccoded) April 26, 2025\n\nReactions were similarly mixed on TikTok, where some people described the revelation as \"iconic\" and others as problematic. One video criticizing Wallen, Del Rey, her husband, and her fans has amassed over 64,000 likes.\n\n\"Y'all are about to call me 'the friend that's too woke' and I don't really give a shit, 'cause Lana Del Rey getting on that main stage and saying she kissed Morgan Wallen actually is that bad,\" the creator said.\n\nRepresentatives for Del Rey have not responded to requests for comment from Business Insider."}

Protectionists presented tariffs as the essential policy to quicken the development of manufactures as well as a remedy to the social ills that afflicted the emerging industrial working class. Proponents argued that tariffs would shield American workers from the socially deleterious consequences of the industrial revolution that were already observable by the early 19th century in Europe, especially in Britain. Imagining tariffs as a paternalistic state response to the legitimate concerns of workers, protectionists ensured that industrialization in the U.S. would not follow the same declining course as it had in Britain. Instead, protectionists argued that tariffs would shelter American workers from the competition of cheap foreign labor by propping up domestic wages and creating the opportunities for social-economic mobility so necessary to what became known as the American Dream.\n\nBut by the end of the 19th century, the industrial social-economic order that tariffs helped foster were quite different from what earlier protectionists had promised. To help distinguish promises from reality, we should remember the work of the thinker who shaped lasting beliefs about tariffs in the U.S.: Henry Carey. Although the 1791 publication of Alexander Hamilton’s Report on Manufactures initiated America’s support for tariffs, it was Henry Carey (1793-1879), a Philadelphia printer who later became President Abraham Lincoln’s economic adviser, who united what had been a set of disparate ideas about trade policy into an all-encompassing ideology. Carey focused various strains of American economic, political, social and cultural values towards a single principle: protectionism. And in the process, Carey became America’s most influential economic thinker. Much like how Trump has made China a key bogeyman in his trade war, protectionists like Carey linked tariffs to a patriotic, nationalistic disdain for Britain. American Anglophobia was palpable years after the American Revolution, swelling during the War of 1812, and aggravated again by the Panic of 1819, America’s first major economic crisis. Modern economists attribute the Panic to the business cycle and reckless monetary expansionism. But protectionists of the era argued that it was a conspiracy orchestrated by British merchants to “dump” cheap English wares at American ports, crushing domestic “infant industry” and impoverishing American workers. Some argued that Britain waged an economic “war of extermination” against the U.S.\n\nAccording to protectionists, the conspiracy to restore the U.S. to British colonial dependence combined a commercial and an intellectual assault. American protectionists grew suspicious of those spreading free-trade propaganda. This included Southerners who were America’s staunchest free-trade advocates, lest their cotton trade with Britain be disrupted. The sharpest attacks, however, were leveled against Adam Smith, the Scottish economist who became the perfect straw-man for early American protectionists. Smith had promoted laissez-faire economics which contended a wide range of things, including the individual pursuit of self-interest, minimum government intervention in the economy, the value of competition, the belief in self-regulating free markets, and free trade. Combined with David Ricardo (1772-1823), another influential British economist who expounded on the benefits of free trade with his theory of comparative advantage, by the mid-19th century laissez-faire became the central tenet to what was then a burgeoning discipline: economics. And Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1776) became its preferred text.\n\nRead More: Why Economists Are Horrified by Trump's Tariff Math To counter the growing free-trade movement, Carey led a cadre of American protectionist writers, politicians, and industry lobbyists to transform the nation into a tariff fortress. Carey pointed to Hamilton’s Report on Manufactures to construct what emerged as a theoretical and political juggernaut: the home-market argument. Hamilton aimed to unite Americans under a single national economic interest. With the tariff, farms and factories could coexist as complementary—rather than rival—sectors. Instead of relying on the commercial whims of foreign markets, Carey reasoned that tariffs would direct domestic agriculture to feed industrial workers and supply factories with raw materials. Manufacturers were promised employment through a steady demand from local consumers. Carey believed this would allow “the loom and anvil to take their natural place by the side of the plough and the harrow.”\n\nHe argued that protectionism was a “really American policy,” freed from the vestiges and authorities of the Old World. To develop America first, protectionists turned inward, encouraged economic isolation, and touted the U.S. as the only nation capable of true economic self-sufficiency. But Carey’s principal interest was how tariffs would protect the working class from the damaging tendencies of free trade. Carey criticized laissez-faire economics for degrading the British working class. In his eyes, Britain stocked its “satanic mills” with “wage slaves,” debasing workers into paupers and exacerbating class conflict. By contrast, tariffs would differentiate American industrialization from the British experience, shielding domestic labor from subsistence wages and securing workers opportunities for social-economic mobility. With this rhetoric, protectionists defended tariffs as the policy instrument to mitigate class divisions and promote a “harmony of interests” between workers and capitalists.\n\nCarey and his fellow protectionists found a receptive audience in the Republican Party, which was known as the “tariff party” since its inception in 1854. The Morrill Tariff (1861), which Carey helped write, initiated decades of trade restrictions that climaxed with the McKinley Tariff (1890) and the Dingley Tariff (1899). The latter effectively raised rates to 50% on over one thousand imported goods, solidifying America as one of the world’s most protected markets. In the battle of ideas between free trade and protectionism, protectionism won. And by the early 1900s, the U.S. had emerged as an industrial behemoth. And yet, despite over a century of protectionist sentiment and high tariff policies, accompanied by seemingly real, tangible economic results, many Americans realized that the tariff was not the silver bullet Carey and other protectionists had promised. Carey’s pledges to American workers were left unfulfilled. In fact, working conditions declined considerably, as captured in the popular writings of Upton Sinclair, the photographs of Jacob Riis, and the speeches of an emergent left-wing working class.\n\nTariffs had morphed into vehicles of special interests, raising monopolistic Robber Barons who smashed organized labor and ignored the statist and interventionist elements of protectionism while simultaneously preaching Social Darwinism as gospel. The corruption attendant to tariff legislation became so brazen and shameless that, in 1913 voters ratified the 16th Amendment granting the federal government powers to tax personal incomes in exchange for lowering tariffs. Read More: What Are Tariffs and Why Is Trump In Favor of Them?\n\nCarey and the early generation of American protectionists were not apologists for industrial capitalism. Rather, Carey appreciated how industrialization had fundamentally changed society. His hope was that tariffs would mollify the socially harmful effects of the combined forces of libertarian economics and industrialization to abate the anticipated degradation of the working class. What Carey’s contemporaries referred to as the “change economy” promised to transform society. For Carey, tariffs could smooth that transition. But in reality, the American version of the industrial revolution would come to mirror that of the British experience, which is precisely what early protectionists sought to avoid.\n\nMuch like how Carey considered free trade an existential threat to America, critics of modern-day globalization, or international free trade, believe these forces are a threat to America’s position in the global economy today. And also like free trade, globalization could deteriorate—or already has deteriorated—conditions for America’s working class. And while it occurred through industrialization in the past, today it might be through the effects of de-industrialization. Revisiting the origins of America’s affinity for protectionism offers guidance for how tariffs might help the U.S. manage today’s more modern, global, and digital economic revolution—as well as the limits of tariffs.\n\nChristopher W.

Meanwhile, Pro users will have access to 125 tasks with standard Deep Research and 125 tasks with the lightweight version.\n\nWhen we reviewed ChatGPT Pro, we found that Deep Research was the best feature included in the ultra-premium subscription, with other AI assistants currently trying to mimic it but none offering anything that comes close to matching it. But ChatGPT Pro is extremely expensive—about $200/mo as of this writing—and it’s hard to justify that even if Deep Research is that good. So it’s nice to be able to have a lightweight version of it, especially without even having to pay for it."}

The campaign compared file-sharing to stealing handbags, televisions, and cars, and it frequently appeared before films in theaters and on commercial DVDs. Now, TorrentFreak points out that the font used in the ads may have been pirated.\n\nInstead of using the original font called “FF Confidential,” which was designed by Just van Rossum in 1992 and requires licensing for commercial use, it appears that the anti-piracy campaign used a font called “XBAND Rough” instead. XBAND Rough is a free clone of FF Confidential, created by Catapult Entertainment in 1996.\n\nHow can you tell the difference? Well, one Fediverse user found the XBAND Rough font embedded in a PDF file that was hosted on the official campaign website. TorrentFreak confirmed that XBAND Rough is embedded in both an official brochure (PDF) and an official flyer (PDF). However, TorrentFreak cautions against drawing any direct conclusions, as it’s entirely possible that the campaign still used a licensed version.\n\n“I knew my font was used for the campaign and that a pirated clone named XBAND Rough existed. I did not know that the campaign used XBAND Rough and not FF Confidential, though. So this fact is new to me, and I find it hilarious,” said Just van Rossum to TorrentFreak.\n\nVan Rossum says he has no plans to follow up on the whole thing as he is no longer the font’s official distributor. The licensing of FF Confidential is currently handled by Monotype."}

Today, you can give your rig the upgrade it deserves with a Samsung 49-inch OLED ultrawide gaming monitor. At $949.99, it’s not exactly cheap, but it’s $650 off the original price.\n\nSamsung’s G93SC gets discounted pretty frequently—maybe its standard price is more aspirational than realistic—but that doesn’t mean it’s any less impressive as a monitor. With an enormous 5120×1440 resolution on its curved OLED panel, it’s basically two 1440p screens smooshed into one. And the size and resolution aren’t its only superlatives, with it also rocking a 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time. Trying to push that resolution at that speed will bring even the most powerful machine to its knees on any recent 3D game.\n\nThis massive ultrawide monitor also includes USB-C video with 65 watts of charging for laptops and plenty of adjustments for gamers, along with a pair of speakers that you absolutely shouldn’t use. It also has VESA mounting for a monitor arm, though you’ll need a beefy one to handle its weight. For all the details, be sure to check out PCWorld’s full review. You can also check out our roundup of the best gaming monitors.\n\nAmazon has marked this one as a “limited time deal,” so this price might not stick around for long. That said, this model does go on sale on the regular, so if you’re a little light on disposable income at the moment, I wouldn’t be too put out if you have to let this deal pass you by.\n\nGet this giant Samsung OLED ultrawide gaming monitor for $950"}

What’s a gamer to do? Well, if you also happen to have a 3D printer and an OLED USB-C monitor, you get to printing! That’s what one Deck owner did, slapping a 13-inch screen on top of Valve’s portable gaming powerhouse, making it a lot less portable in the process.\n\nPrintables user djared says, “I didn’t want to get a new Steam Deck just to have an OLED screen, so I made this… lol.” Lol, indeed. The 3D-printed bracket clamps onto the front screen of the Steam Deck, like a gigantic version of those phone mounts for a console controller. It’s made specifically for this Innocn 13.3-inch portable USB-C monitor, accounting for its unique rotating kickstand while leaving plenty of room to connect the USB-C cable.\n\nThanks to the Steam Deck’s easy compatibility with USB-C accessories and external displays, it should be easy enough for it to output to the 1080p screen and take advantage of that luscious OLED color saturation. But when the Steam Deck needs to power both its own operation and a laptop-sized screen at the same time? Expect any similar setup to suck down its battery faster than a teenager going through a 7-Eleven Slurpee. I also wonder if djared is a bodybuilder because holding a Steam Deck and a portable monitor at once must be quite the workout.\n\nThe design is available as a free STL file if you want to try printing it out for yourself or adapting it to your own portable monitor. Have fun—and once you’re done, don’t skip leg day."}

The hours of corporate training and “please let us track you with cookies, we pinky-promise we need them” messages that appear on nearly every website? Not so much. Now, the latest version of the Brave browser hopes to get rid of them—the pop-ups, not the training—with a new tool.\n\nThe developers are calling it “Cookiecrumbler,” a method for detecting and blocking the ubiquitous cookie consent notices across the web with a variety of approaches. The thing is, blocking these pop-ups was already built into Brave… but blocking the pop-ups wasn’t the biggest problem. According to the announcement post (spotted by BleepingComputer), it’s doing so without breaking the page afterward. It requires an approach that’s almost tailored to each individual site, as these notices are similar but not identical across the web.\n\nCookiecrumbler aggregates auto-detection with large language models (“AI”), combined with human reviewers who can iron out the wrinkles where the LLM makes mistakes in detection or automatic translation. The tool is running on Brave’s backend servers at the moment so it can crawl the web and set up rules on a site-by-site basis. The team says it wants to switch things into a browser-based version eventually.\n\nThe best news? Brave is publishing Cookiecrumbler as an open-source tool, so it could be implemented and iterated by other teams. If you prefer another alternative browser (like my personal fave Vivaldi) or you’re uncomfortable with some of Brave’s (ahem) less altruistic moves, you could see Cookiecrumbler pop up in your browser of choice soon."}

Structured writing and formatting are not.\n\nIf you want your content to show up in AI Overviews, Perplexity summaries, ChatGPT citations, or any of the increasingly common “direct answer” features driven by LLMs, the architecture of your content matters: Headings. Paragraphs. Lists. Order. Clarity. Consistency.\n\nIn this article, I’m unpacking how LLMs interpret content — and what you can do to make sure your message is not just crawled, but understood.\n\nHow LLMs Actually Interpret Web Content\n\nLet’s start with the basics.\n\nUnlike traditional search engine crawlers that rely heavily on markup, metadata, and link structures, LLMs interpret content differently.\n\nThey don’t scan a page the way a bot does. They ingest it, break it into tokens, and analyze the relationships between words, sentences, and concepts using attention mechanisms.\n\nThey’re not looking for a <meta> tag or a JSON-LD snippet to tell them what a page is about. They’re looking for semantic clarity: Does this content express a clear idea? Is it coherent? Does it answer a question directly?\n\nLLMs like GPT-4 or Gemini analyze:\n\nThe order in which information is presented.\n\nThe hierarchy of concepts (which is why headings still matter).\n\nFormatting cues like bullet points, tables, bolded summaries.\n\nRedundancy and reinforcement, which help models determine what’s most important.\n\nThis is why poorly structured content – even if it’s keyword-rich and marked up with schema – can fail to show up in AI summaries, while a clear, well-formatted blog post without a single line of JSON-LD might get cited or paraphrased directly.\n\nWhy Structure Matters More Than Ever In AI Search\n\nTraditional search was about ranking; AI search is about representation.\n\nWhen a language model generates a response to a query, it’s pulling from many sources – often sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph.\n\nIt’s not retrieving a whole page and showing it. It’s building a new answer based on what it can understand.\n\nWhat gets understood most reliably?\n\nContent that is:\n\nSegmented logically, so each part expresses one idea.\n\nConsistent in tone and terminology.\n\nPresented in a format that lends itself to quick parsing (think FAQs, how-to steps, definition-style intros).\n\nWritten with clarity, not cleverness.\n\nAI search engines don’t need schema to pull a step-by-step answer from a blog post.\n\nBut, they do need you to label your steps clearly, keep them together, and not bury them in long-winded prose or interrupt them with calls to action, pop-ups, or unrelated tangents.\n\nClean structure is now a ranking factor – not in the traditional SEO sense, but in the AI citation economy we’re entering.\n\nWhat LLMs Look For When Parsing Content\n\nHere’s what I’ve observed (both anecdotally and through testing across tools like Perplexity, ChatGPT Browse, Bing Copilot, and Google’s AI Overviews):\n\nClear Headings And Subheadings: LLMs use heading structure to understand hierarchy. Pages with proper H1–H2–H3 nesting are easier to parse than walls of text or div-heavy templates.\n\nLLMs use heading structure to understand hierarchy. Pages with proper H1–H2–H3 nesting are easier to parse than walls of text or div-heavy templates. Short, Focused Paragraphs: Long paragraphs bury the lede. LLMs favor self-contained thoughts. Think one idea per paragraph.\n\nLong paragraphs bury the lede. LLMs favor self-contained thoughts. Think one idea per paragraph. Structured Formats (Lists, Tables, FAQs): If you want to get quoted, make it easy to lift your content. Bullets, tables, and Q&A formats are goldmines for answer engines.\n\nIf you want to get quoted, make it easy to lift your content. Bullets, tables, and Q&A formats are goldmines for answer engines. Defined Topic Scope At The Top: Put your TL;DR early. Don’t make the model (or the user) scroll through 600 words of brand story before getting to the meat.\n\nPut your TL;DR early. Don’t make the model (or the user) scroll through 600 words of brand story before getting to the meat. Semantic Cues In The Body: Words like “in summary,” “the most important,” “step 1,” and “common mistake” help LLMs identify relevance and structure. There’s a reason so much AI-generated content uses those “giveaway” phrases. It’s not because the model is lazy or formulaic. It’s because it actually knows how to structure information in a way that’s clear, digestible, and effective, which, frankly, is more than can be said for a lot of human writers.\n\nA Real-World Example: Why My Own Article Didn’t Show Up\n\nIn December 2024, I wrote a piece about the relevance of schema in AI-first search.\n\nIt was structured for clarity, timeliness, and was highly relevant to this conversation, but didn’t show up in my research queries for this article (the one you are presently reading). The reason? I didn’t use the term “LLM” in the title or slug.\n\nAll of the articles returned in my search had “LLM” in the title. Mine said “AI Search” but didn’t mention LLMs explicitly.\n\nYou might assume that a large language model would understand “AI search” and “LLMs” are conceptually related – and it probably does – but understanding that two things are related and choosing what to return based on the prompt are two different things.\n\nWhere does the model get its retrieval logic? From the prompt. It interprets your question literally.\n\nIf you say, “Show me articles about LLMs using schema,” it will surface content that directly includes “LLMs” and “schema” – not necessarily content that’s adjacent, related, or semantically similar, especially when it has plenty to choose from that contains the words in the query (a.k.a. the prompt).\n\nSo, even though LLMs are smarter than traditional crawlers, retrieval is still rooted in surface-level cues.\n\nThis might sound suspiciously like keyword research still matters – and yes, it absolutely does. Not because LLMs are dumb, but because search behavior (even AI search) still depends on how humans phrase things.\n\nThe retrieval layer – the layer that decides what’s eligible to be summarized or cited – is still driven by surface-level language cues.\n\nWhat Research Tells Us About Retrieval\n\nEven recent academic work supports this layered view of retrieval.\n\nA 2023 research paper by Doostmohammadi et al. found that simpler, keyword-matching techniques, like a method called BM25, often led to better results than approaches focused solely on semantic understanding.\n\nThe improvement was measured through a drop in perplexity, which tells us how confident or uncertain a language model is when predicting the next word.\n\nIn plain terms: Even in systems designed to be smart, clear and literal phrasing still made the answers better.\n\nSo, the lesson isn’t just to use the language they’ve been trained to recognize. The real lesson is: If you want your content to be found, understand how AI search works as a system – a chain of prompts, retrieval, and synthesis. Plus, make sure you’re aligned at the retrieval layer.\n\nThis isn’t about the limits of AI comprehension. It’s about the precision of retrieval.\n\nLanguage models are incredibly capable of interpreting nuanced content, but when they’re acting as search agents, they still rely on the specificity of the queries they’re given.\n\nThat makes terminology, not just structure, a key part of being found.\n\nHow To Structure Content For AI Search\n\nIf you want to increase your odds of being cited, summarized, or quoted by AI-driven search engines, it’s time to think less like a writer and more like an information architect – and structure content for AI search accordingly.\n\nThat doesn’t mean sacrificing voice or insight, but it does mean presenting ideas in a format that makes them easy to extract, interpret, and reassemble.\n\nCore Techniques For Structuring AI-Friendly Content\n\nHere are some of the most effective structural tactics I recommend:\n\nUse A Logical Heading Hierarchy\n\nStructure your pages with a single clear H1 that sets the context, followed by H2s and H3s that nest logically beneath it.\n\nLLMs, like human readers, rely on this hierarchy to understand the flow and relationship between concepts.\n\nIf every heading on your page is an H1, you’re signaling that everything is equally important, which means nothing stands out.\n\nGood heading structure is not just semantic hygiene; it’s a blueprint for comprehension.\n\nKeep Paragraphs Short And Self-Contained\n\nEvery paragraph should communicate one idea clearly.\n\nWalls of text don’t just intimidate human readers; they also increase the likelihood that an AI model will extract the wrong part of the answer or skip your content altogether.\n\nThis is closely tied to readability metrics like the Flesch Reading Ease score, which rewards shorter sentences and simpler phrasing.\n\nWhile it may pain those of us who enjoy a good, long, meandering sentence (myself included), clarity and segmentation help both humans and LLMs follow your train of thought without derailing.\n\nUse Lists, Tables, And Predictable Formats\n\nIf your content can be turned into a step-by-step guide, numbered list, comparison table, or bulleted breakdown, do it. AI summarizers love structure, so do users.\n\nFrontload Key Insights\n\nDon’t save your best advice or most important definitions for the end.\n\nLLMs tend to prioritize what appears early in the content. Give your thesis, definition, or takeaway up top, then expand on it.\n\nUse Semantic Cues\n\nSignal structure with phrasing like “Step 1,” “In summary,” “Key takeaway,” “Most common mistake,” and “To compare.”\n\nThese phrases help LLMs (and readers) identify the role each passage plays.\n\nAvoid Noise\n\nInterruptive pop-ups, modal windows, endless calls-to-action (CTAs), and disjointed carousels can pollute your content.\n\nEven if the user closes them, they’re often still present in the Document Object Model (DOM), and they dilute what the LLM sees.\n\nThink of your content like a transcript: What would it sound like if read aloud? If it’s hard to follow in that format, it might be hard for an LLM to follow, too.\n\nThe Role Of Schema: Still Useful, But Not A Magic Bullet\n\nLet’s be clear: Structured data still has value. It helps search engines understand content, populate rich results, and disambiguate similar topics.\n\nHowever, LLMs don’t require it to understand your content.\n\nIf your site is a semantic dumpster fire, schema might save you, but wouldn’t it be better to avoid building a dumpster fire in the first place?\n\nSchema is a helpful boost, not a magic bullet. Prioritize clear structure and communication first, and use markup to reinforce – not rescue – your content.\n\nHow Schema Still Supports AI Understanding\n\nThat said, Google has recently confirmed at Search Central Live in Madrid that its LLM (Gemini), which powers AI Overviews, does leverage structured data to help understand content more effectively.\n\nIn fact, at the event, John Mueller recommends to use structured data because it gives models clearer signals about intent and structure.\n\nThat doesn’t contradict the point; it reinforces it. If your content isn’t already structured and understandable, schema can help fill the gaps. It’s a crutch, not a cure.\n\nSchema is a helpful boost, but not a substitute, for structure and clarity.\n\nIn AI-driven search environments, we’re seeing content without any structured data show up in citations and summaries because the core content was well-organized, well-written, and easily parsed.\n\nIn short:\n\nUse schema when it helps clarify the intent or context.\n\nDon’t rely on it to fix bad content or a disorganized layout.\n\nPrioritize content quality and layout before markup.\n\nThe future of content visibility is built on how well you communicate, not just how well you tag.\n\nConclusion: Structure For Meaning, Not Just For Machines\n\nOptimizing for LLMs doesn’t mean chasing new tools or hacks. It means doubling down on what good communication has always required: clarity, coherence, and structure.\n\nIf you want to stay competitive, you’ll need to structure content for AI search just as carefully as you structure it for human readers.\n\nThe best-performing content in AI search isn’t necessarily the most optimized. It’s the most understandable. That means:\n\nAnticipating how content will be interpreted, not just indexed.\n\nGiving AI the framework it needs to extract your ideas.\n\nStructuring pages for comprehension, not just compliance.\n\nAnticipating and using the language your audience uses, because LLMs respond literally to prompts and retrieval depends on those exact terms being present.\n\nAs search shifts from links to language, we’re entering a new era of content design. One where meaning rises to the top, and the brands that structure for comprehension will rise right along with it.\n\nMore Resources:\n\nFeatured Image: Igor Link/Shutterstock"}

Temu just doubled prices because of Trump’s tariffs", "fullContent": "As America apparently digs in for the long haul in a trade war with China, one of the most popular places on the web for cheap consumer goods is increasing its prices. With import taxes skyrocketing for US residents and the de minimus exemption set to disappear, Temu has raised prices on most of its items. Prices appear to have more than doubled for most items originating from China.\n\nDe minimis exceptions are a rule that allows items imported to the US with a declared value of under $800 to be exempt from import taxes. This is what enables popular China-based marketplaces like Temu, Shein, and AliExpress to offer items at prices far lower than even companies like Amazon or Walmart. Though de minimis (literally “with trifles” in Latin) is a policy designed to avoid overincumbering taxation and customs on items that would be more expensive to track than the tax actually collected, US president Trump has declared an end to the de minimis exemptions in addition to incredibly onerous taxes on imports from China. De minimus is scheduled to be suspended on May 2nd, subjecting most items to the same 145 percent import taxes as other Chinese goods.\n\n“Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up,” says a message on Temu’s website. “To keep offering the product you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025.”\n\nWhile the 145 percent tax rate does not automatically mean that, say, a $10 T-shirt costs $24.50, that’s generally how it plays out as both suppliers and retailers pass the cost on to consumers. CNBC observes prices on many items roughly equivalent to the tariff rate, more than doubling, and thus making Temu a far less enticing option than some of its US-based competitors.\n\nNot that simply buying from another site will help much. With a huge amount of goods sold to Americans still originating from China, including everything from clothing to food to electronics to car parts, experts are predicting widespread price increases and the obvious hammer-blow to Americans’ buying power. Consumers aren’t the only ones affected, as US-based companies reliant upon Chinese imports for their goods are already facing massively increased operating costs. Many have stopped offering sales to Americans. Some smaller companies, including PC manufacturers, are facing an existential crisis if tariffs on Chinese goods continue for an extended period of time.\n\nSome goods sold on Temu ship from US-based suppliers and are not immediately subject to import tariffs, labelled with a “local” tag. But since most of these items appear to be merely held in US warehouses in anticipation of being ordered, it seems probably that these prices will also rise once domestic supply runs out and new goods from China are imported."}

We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act.\"\n\nThanedar explained the seven articles of impeachment included in his resolution in a brief video, which he shared on social media.\n\nAs a statement from the congressman's office details, Trump's alleged constitutional violations are:\n\nObstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice. Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds. Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations. Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media, and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech. Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution. Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain. Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.\n\nEarlier this month, Thanedar called for Trump's impeachment over his administration's failure to comply with a 9-0 Supreme Court ruling about facilitating the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from a prison in El Salvador to the United States.\n\n\"We must take action now,\" he said at the time. \"Donald Trump and members of his administration are deporting people with limited evidence and no due process to horrific megaprisons in a foreign nation. As a member of Congress, I have a responsibility to uphold the checks and balances that safeguard the integrity of our democracy and prevent a slide into authoritarianism. This must be a red line. Otherwise, we risk Donald Trump continuing to defy the Constitution in his own interest, rather than the interest of the nation.\"\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" Thanedar declared. \"We can not allow this obvious authoritarian power grab to continue. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for the Constitution and the American people and join the call for impeachment.\"\n\nWhile Thanedar had expressed support for impeachment prior to Monday, his resolution came as a second primary challenger announced his candidacy for Michigan's 13th Congressional District. State Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-11) joined former state Sen. Adam Hollier (D-2), who has twice tried to oust the congressman and is trying to do so again next year.\n\nMcKinney is backed by the progressive group Justice Democrats, whose executive director Alexandra Rojas said in a statement earlier Monday that \"Democratic voters in the face of unprecedented attacks on our livelihoods and liberties are fed up with a Democratic Party overrun by do-nothing career politicians who are totally unequipped to lead in this moment. Donavan represents the future the Democratic Party should be fighting: working-class people taking our power back from multimillionaires to deliver for everyday people.\"\n\nAfter Thanedar announced the impeachment resolution, Business Insider senior politics reporter Bryan Metzger said on social media Monday that it is \"always interesting to see how primary challenges affect members' behavior, though usually it's a bit more subtle than this.\"\n\nRecent polling has found that a majority of voters disapprove of how Trump is handling his job and would support a historic third impeachment. In response to one survey, Free Speech for People's Alexandra Flores-Quilty—whose group is leading a nonpartisan Impeach Trump Again campaign—declared Friday that \"it's up to Congress to do their job, defend the Constitution, and impeach and remove Donald Trump from office for his grave abuses of power.\"\n\nTrump is the only president to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives—though in both cases during his first term, he was acquitted by the Senate. Republicans now narrowly control both chambers of Congress.\n\nWhile Republicans haven't yet signaled a willingness to stand against the president, U.S. Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) told attendees of an early April anti-Trump rally that \"within the next 30 days, I'm bringing articles of impeachment.\"\n\nAxiosnoted Monday that \"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) also privately floated impeaching Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard over Signalgate.\"\n\n"}

The other criticised Singapore’s housing policies, linking them to immigration.\n\nIn a media statement on Monday, PAS secretary general Takiyuddin Hassan said: \"It must be emphasised that the posts in question represent their personal views and in no way reflect PAS' official policy or stance as a political party - whether regarding Singapore as a nation ot its ongoing processes.\n\n\"PAS believes that both individuals were merely expressing their personal opinions without any intention to interfere, let alone influence the outcome of the election scheduled for May 3, as alleged.\"\n\nMr Takiyuddin said that while PAS respects Singapore's concerns on the matter, it also believes that Singapore's reaction was \"somewhat exaggerated and unilateral\", given the party's good relations with the Singapore government.\n\nPAS noted that the two party leaders have denied the allegations of foreign interference.\n\n\"PAS' policy of maintaining formal bilateral relations as the legitimate channel for conveying any views of discussing matters of mutual interest - including with the Singapore government - as practised thus far, clearly proved that these allegations were inaccurate or untrue,\" it added."}

It merges Facebook’s in-stream ads and performance bonus programs into one, effectively simplifying its creator monetization process.\n\nLast year, Facebook moved away from a revenue-share payout model — which paid publishers based on the performance of ads in content — to a model that pays creators and publishers based on the performance of their content, with rates varying based on region, content and other signals.\n\nAn exec at a news publisher who asked to speak anonymously said they are seeing some of their pages bring in revenue through this program, without having changed the volume or type of posts they publish on Facebook.\n\nPosts with photos are generating most of the revenue, which has been calculated based on how many interactions their posts get, according to the exec. The publisher is on track to bring in seven figures of revenue from this program this year, they said.\n\nThe exec estimated that so far, that is six to eight times more money than previous Facebook monetization programs — at least for this publisher, which produces more images and text content than video.\n\nPublishers have learned the hard way not to rely on consistent revenue or traffic referral from Meta. Facebook stopped paying publishers in 2022 for their content to appear in its curated Facebook News tab and removed Instant Articles, which helped publishers monetize their content in Facebook’s mobile app, in 2023. So publishers know it’s no long-term lifeline, but in a cash-strapped moment, even a fleeting bump in traffic and revenue is hard to ignore.\n\nAnother exec at a lifestyle publisher who requested anonymity told Digiday that the bonus program brought in “low six figures” last year. They described the revenue as “inconsistent” because Meta decides which pages will be monetizable through the program, and for specific periods of a month or two, they said.\n\nBut when that does get turned on, they amp up their production. The exec estimated they produce about 25% more videos during these bonus periods. “It’s been a decent amount of … ancillary revenue. But it’s not something we count on,” they said.\n\nHowever, compared to other content monetization programs for publishers like Facebook Watch, which were flat-fee rates for video series, this “performance-based revenue” has been a more dependable source of revenue — so far, they added.\n\nBoth publishing execs said they have no control over which pages or posts are enabled by Meta to make them money, though. And publishers interviewed for this story said they had not received any explanation from Meta reps when they queried why they were seeing more money from Facebook.\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment before the story’s publishing time.\n\nIt’s a similar phenomenon to what’s happening with referral traffic. Digiday reported earlier this month that some news publishers were starting to see Facebook referral traffic return this year. Similarweb data showed 75% of the top 68 biggest news sites saw the share of total desktop Facebook referral traffic increase in March year over year, according to a Press Gazette report published this month.\n\nBut for other publishers, money from Facebook remains elusive. During a closed-door town hall session at the Digiday Publishing Summit in Vail, Colorado in March, a publishing exec said they made $500.00 a month from the content monetization program. Others agreed that the earnings from the platform were negligible."}

They captioned it as, \"A young woman writing a thank you note to her boyfriend in the Navy for the skull of a Japanese soldier that he sent, 1944.\" In the past, numerous users shared the same picture and similar captions on Facebook, iFunny, Instagram, Reddit, Threads and X.\n\n(@fasc1nate/X)\n\nThe May 22, 1944, issue of Life magazine — archived by Google Books — featured the original printing of the photo of the woman and skull. In the issue, the image received the distinction of \"picture of the week,\" and was captioned: \"Arizona war worker writes her Navy boyfriend a thank you note for the Jap skull he sent her.\" The magazine also featured the following additional information on the preceding page, identifying the woman as Natalie Nickerson:\n\nWhen he said goodbye two years ago to Natalie Nickerson, 20, a war worker of Phoenix, Arizona, a big, handsome Navy lieutenant promised her a Jap. Last week, Natalie received a human skull, autographed by her lieutenant and 13 friends, and inscribed: \"This is a good Jap — a dead one picked up on the New Guinea beach.\" Natalie, surprised at the gift, named it Tojo. The armed forces disapprove strongly of this sort of thing.\n\nTime magazine later credited the picture to photographer Ralph Crane alongside reporting a brief history of war atrocities.\n\nTo learn more, Snopes called Jennifer Paine Welwood and Wingate Paine II, two children of Nickerson — later Natalie Nickerson Paine, after marrying photographer Wingate Paine in 1949. Both children recalled their mother's successful modeling career in New York City that followed World War II. Welwood said she remembered being \"completely horrified\" by her mother's photo. Wingate Paine II added that he regarded the picture as a \"propaganda photo\" and recalled his mother later \"felt regretful\" about her participation in it.\n\n\"From what I understood, from what she told me many, many years ago, because I had seen the photo, I've seen actually the Life magazine copy, that this had been basically a photo shoot and that, it was, it was a whole posed thing, and she did not have a boyfriend in the Pacific,\" Wingate Paine II said. \"And she felt, you know, she felt, I don't know. I can't really put words in her mouth. She felt regretful that she had allowed herself to be put into the situation. But, in those [times], you know, it was war and Japan was the enemy. And I'm sure as a young woman, she was persuaded that this would be good for her career.\"\n\nRegarding the whereabouts of the skull, Welwood said, \"I have no idea. And who knows if that was even genuine or some kind of a prop?\"\n\nThe life of Natalie Nickerson Paine\n\nOver the decades, newspaper stories archived on Newspapers.com featured articles mentioning Natalie Nickerson Paine. After graduating in 1940 from Phoenix Union High School in Arizona, she moved to New York City to try to become a model, with one newspaper mentioning her height as 5 feet 10 inches. Within a year, she returned home.\n\n\"I tried at the modeling agencies — Conover and Powers were the two big ones then — and didn't get anywhere,\" she told the Arizona Republic. \"Then the war came and I came back to Phoenix and found a patriotic job, operating a drill press job at AiResearch on the graveyard shift. I had a whale of a time, too, even though I had grease clear up to my elbows all night long.\" Wingate Paine II also told us his mother made altimeters for B-17 bombers. (Garrett AiResearch was a manufacturer of turboprop engines and turbochargers, and a pioneer in numerous aerospace technologies.)\n\nAfter World War II, she headed back to New York to try modeling once more. \"After the war, I decided to try New York again — but this time when the agencies still turned me down, I went out on my own, contacting photographers personally for bookings and was soon highly successful.\" The Republic said she soon \"established herself as one of America's 10 top models.\" Wingate Paine II, her son, told us, \"She went on to become the highest-paid model in fashion model in the world. She was the first to ever earn $40 an hour.\" (Snopes did not locate sources to independently verify this claim.)\n\nThe caption for a photo published with one November 1945 article read, \"HOLIDAY VISITORS HERE: Among the many Thanksgiving holiday visitors in Phoenix last week were lovely Natalie Nickerson, one of the country's 10 top models, and her brother, Capt. William A. Nickerson, much decorated marine pilot now on terminal leave from the service, who were guests of their mother, Mrs. Vivian Nickerson, 1221 North First street.\"\n\n25 Nov 1945, Sun, The Arizona Republic (Phoenix, Arizona) Newspapers.com\n\nIn 1946, she served as Eileen Ford's top model for the Ford Model Agency, per The Daily Beast.\n\nOn Jan. 21, 1949, she married Wingate Paine, a photographer who previously captured pictures of her modeling work, with subsequent mentions of her name appearing as Mrs. Wingate Paine. The Republic said Wingate Paine was \"one of the leading fashion and commercial photographers in New York.\" A later article said she appeared in photographs for both Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. Wingate Paine II and his sister, Jeanette (later Jennifer), appear with their mother in the newspaper photo below:\n\n08 Sep 1958, Mon, The Arizona Republic (Phoenix, Arizona) Newspapers.com\n\nSubsequent newspaper articles documented her efforts to found the Plaza Five modeling agency and save New York's old Metropolitan Opera House from demolition.

And the Trump White House has taken notice.\n\nOn Monday, Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-MI), a native of India, flew back into DC after yet another unwarranted congressional vacation and decided to file a whopping SEVEN articles of impeachment against President Trump. And unsurprisingly, the catalyst for Thanedar filing articles of impeachment was Trump daring to deport a dangerous MS-13 gangster and alleged wife-beater.\n\n“Trump has already done real damage to our democracy,” Thandedar whined. “But defying a unanimous 9-0 Supreme Court ruling? That has to be the final straw.”\n\n“The court said the wrongfully deported Kilmar Garcia must be allowed to return and receive due process,” he continued. “Trump ignored it. He ignored the Constitution, he ignored the very checks and balances that keep our democracy intact.”\n\nThanedar went on to introduce a whopping SEVEN articles of impeachment against Trump. Below are the seven articles listed in order, and Thanedar’s silly reasoning behind each one.\n\n• Obstruction of justice and abuse of executive power. “From denying due process to unlawful deportations, Trump defied court orders.” • Taking away Congress’s power of the purse. “Trump dismantled agencies and froze funds without permission from Congress.” • Abuse of trade powers and international aggression. “He imposed damaging tariffs and threatened military invasions of our allies.” • Violation of First Amendment rights. “He has retaliated against journalists, attorneys, and critics for exercising their right to free speech.” • Creation of an unlawful office. “Establishing the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, DOJ, and giving Elon Musk unconstitutional power over our government and personal data.” • Bribery and corruption. “He has dismissed criminal cases and solicited payments from foreign governments and coerced legal settlements for personal and political gain.” • Tyrannical overreach. “Finally, and most importantly, he is attempting to consolidate unchecked power and erode the constitutional limits of the presidency. In this country, we have presidents, not kings.” “That’s not just misconduct, it’s impeachable misconduct. This isn’t leadership, it’s tyranny.”\n\nWATCH:\n\nBREAKING: Indian-born Congressman Shri Thanedar (D-MI) files to impeach President Donald Trump. He is bringing forward 7 Articles.

Donald Trump must be impeached.”\n\nSteven Cheung, the White House Director of Communications, issued a funny response to Thanedar’s crazy impeachment push. He posted a classic Conor McGregor gif that spoke for practically all conservatives.\n\n“Who the Fook is that guy???”\n\nAs TGP readers know, radical-left Rep. Al Green (D-TX) announced articles of impeachment against Trump back in February.\n\nGreen went on an insane rampage against Trump’s provocative comments during a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from Israel. Trump had floated the idea of the US taking over the Gaza Strip and redeveloping it.\n\n“I rise today to announce the movement to impeach the President has begun!” Green shouted. “I rise today to announce I will bring articles of impeachment against the president for dastardly deeds proposed and dastardly deeds done!”"}

Right? Well, maybe not.\n\nThat might’ve been the common sense mantra for decades, but things are starting to change and it may not be true anymore. With added protections incorporated into Microsoft’s latest version of Windows, you may not actually need a separate security solution.\n\nAre Windows 11’s built-in antivirus and security features enough for everyday users? The answer is, “Yes… but.” Here’s why.\n\nFurther reading: The best Windows antivirus software\n\nWindows Security in a nutshell\n\nWindows has always had some security measures in place to protect you against hackers, cybercriminals, and malware. Those security measures have dramatically improved over the past decade, and they’ve never been better than they are in Windows 11.\n\nAlthough the additional requirements to even install the latest version of Windows might be annoying if you’re running older (ineligible) hardware, mandating secure boot and other protective features help make Windows 11 the most secure version of Windows yet.\n\nIndeed, Windows 11 has several protective measures that come installed by default, and they’re packaged together as Windows Security. Together, these features make Windows 11 secure enough for the average user to not need third-party antivirus software. Mostly.\n\nHere’s a look at each major aspect of Windows Security, what it tries to do, and how it protects you from threats.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus\n\nYou can manage Microsoft Defender from the Windows Security dashboard in Windows 11. Jon Martindale / IDG\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus is the latest iteration of the classic Windows Defender software that first launched as an anti-spyware tool alongside Windows XP.\n\nWith Windows 11, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is fully integrated and installed with the operating system, and it stays on watch for you. It offers real-time protection to detect malicious files before they harm you, but you can also run manual or scheduled malware scans.\n\nIn third-party testing, Microsoft Defender Antivirus showed itself to be just as effective at detecting malware threats as other free antivirus solutions, though in our own testing it did throw up a few false positives. Better safe than sorry, but we understand that can be annoying.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus also offers basic ransomware protections by locking down your files and folders and preventing malicious alterations without admin approval.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus also leverages the cloud to provide faster malware identification, and is regularly updated with new malware signatures to keep your protection up to date.\n\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen\n\nIf you’ve ever tried to run a standalone indie game or an app your friend developed and had Windows try to stop you, that was Microsoft Defender SmartScreen in action.\n\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen is an anti-phishing, anti-malware tool that protects you from malicious websites and applications.\n\nIt analyzes the websites you visit and the apps you run to see if they seem suspicious or potentially harmful. If it senses something off, it’ll raise a flag and block you from visiting that site or running that app.\n\nYou can easily get around Microsoft Defender SmartScreen by clicking a few buttons, but the warning prompt should at least give you enough pause to double-check what you’re trying to do.\n\nWindows Firewall\n\nWindows Firewall filters network traffic to protect you against malicious apps and hackers who want to access your network and devices.\n\nIt can filter network traffic based on various criteria, including the IP address of the device trying to access your network, the port number it’s using, and what kind of app or service it’s trying to interact with. It can also limit network traffic to certain apps, preventing inbound and/or outbound traffic to/from applications and services.\n\nIf Windows Firewall detects an untrustworthy connection attempt, it will automatically block the connection and prevent it from accessing your device and your network.\n\nYou can customize Windows Firewall, including whether it runs on just public networks or private ones too, and what kind of traffic it filters.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Guards\n\nWindows 11 also has some bespoke “Guards” as part of Microsoft Defender that enhance its anti-malware protections.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Application Guard works across a range of Microsoft apps, including Edge and the Microsoft Office suite. It detects potentially malicious websites and/or files, and instead of opening them within Windows, does so within a sandbox that prevents any potentially malicious code from affecting your system.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Exploit Guard helps eliminate common vectors for malware attacks. For example, it can prevent all executables from running within an email client or webmail service, or it can prevent applications from running after clicking links within Office documents.\n\nThere’s also Microsoft Defender Credential Guard, which uses virtualization technology to isolate secret information (like password hashes) so that only privileged system software can access it.\n\nThe different Microsoft Defender Guards are all enabled by default, but also have additional options and protective measures for enterprise users, offering greater granular control over how they work and how much they lock down certain Windows functions.\n\nWhen do you need more than just Windows Security?\n\nNot every antivirus or antimalware solution works with Microsoft Defender. Jon Martindale / IDG\n\nBack to the original question: Are Windows 11’s built-in antivirus and security features enough for everyday users?\n\nFor the most part, yes. The actual security features are effective at what they set out to do. As far as detecting malware and prompting you with warnings when suspicious things happen, Windows 11 works and you probably don’t need a standalone antivirus solution.\n\nBut Windows Security still puts the onus of safety in your hands. Certain features need to be properly configured ahead of time, and the overall protection offered by Windows Security is baseline. You still need to smart, careful, and aware by:\n\nNot visiting shady websites\n\nNot downloading unsolicited files\n\nNot clicking links in emails or social media messages\n\nIf you trust that you’re good enough to keep yourself safe, and if you don’t mind shouldering the responsibility of maintaining good cybersecurity practices, then Windows Security should be enough.\n\nBut if you have frequent lapses in judgment, if you’re anxious about falling prey to malware or cybercriminals, or if you need additional features not included in Windows Security, then consider a paid antivirus suite.\n\nThe best paid antivirus solutions offer more comprehensive protections against malware and phishing, along with additional features like VPNs, password managers, identity protection, parental controls, defense against remote access, and more. Some top-of-the-line services may even monitor your bank accounts and insure you against losses.\n\nIf you’ve decided that Windows Security is good enough, make sure you change these settings to maximize its performance and security."}

However, the real heartbeat of this Liverpool side is someone who often operates away from the spotlight — Alexis Mac Allister.\n\nDavid Lynch, speaking to Dave Davis for Anfield Index, captured the essence of Mac Allister’s influence, stating: “He is brilliant full-stop. Not just in big games, but every single week he is the beating heart to this Liverpool side.” It’s a sentiment that reflects the growing realisation among fans and pundits alike: Alexis Mac Allister is the foundation upon which Arne Slot’s Liverpool has been built.\n\nMac Allister’s Moment of Magic\n\nIn a season defined by moments of quality, few were as impactful as Mac Allister’s stunning strike against Spurs. Lynch described it vividly: “I didn’t think he was going to smash it in with his left-foot from there, it was a brilliant goal and it was a massive goal.”\n\nNot just a beauty, but a goal steeped in significance. This wasn’t merely about artistry; it was the moment Liverpool’s final surge to the title became inevitable. Mac Allister’s ability to deliver when it matters most underlines why he’s so pivotal to Slot’s vision.\n\nWhat sets him apart is not just the technical brilliance but the relentless consistency. As Lynch rightly said: “Yesterday he scores, creates chances and wins the most duels. He’s a genius.” In a team packed with elite talent, being called a ‘genius’ is no small accolade.\n\nUnderrated Excellence\n\nDespite his obvious contributions, Mac Allister remains criminally underrated in some quarters. Lynch noted: “He’s underrated because I think some fans don’t appreciate just how good he is.”\n\nIt’s an intriguing point. While Salah’s goals and Van Dijk’s defensive leadership are easy to quantify, Mac Allister’s influence is subtler. He knits the team together, orchestrating the midfield with a rare blend of poise, vision and tenacity.\n\nSlot’s tactical system thrives on intelligent press resistance and fast transitions, and no one embodies that more than the Argentine.\n\nSlot’s Midfield Architect\n\nUnder Arne Slot’s stewardship, Liverpool’s midfield has undergone a subtle evolution. The traditional heavy metal football remains in spirit, but there is more sophistication now, a nuance best exemplified by Mac Allister.\n\nLynch’s observation is spot-on: “He’s absolutely world-class and that performance yesterday was dominant and it was great that he got that goal because Virgil Van Dijk and Mohamed Salah rightly get the plaudits, but he is the one that makes it all work.”\n\nSlot has found in Mac Allister a player who not only delivers quality but embodies the spirit and intellect of his footballing philosophy. His positional intelligence allows Liverpool to dominate possession, while his defensive contributions — often overlooked — are equally crucial.\n\nLegacy in the Making\n\nAs Liverpool celebrate another title triumph, it is becoming increasingly clear that Mac Allister is not just a cog in the machine — he is the engine. His blend of technical excellence, work ethic and footballing IQ makes him indispensable.\n\nSlot’s Liverpool era will be defined by players like Mac Allister — intelligent, resilient, and capable of moments of sheer brilliance. In years to come, fans will look back at this time and recognise the Argentine as one of the true architects of Liverpool’s modern success.\n\nCredit must go to David Lynch for his sharp insights shared with Dave Davis on Anfield Index, helping shine a light on a player whose brilliance deserves far more widespread recognition."}

One name making headlines is AFC Bournemouth’s Dean Huijsen, a highly-rated young defender who looks set for a high-profile move this summer.\n\nIn a recent appearance on Anfield Index, journalist David Lynch, speaking to Dave Davis, shared some key insights into Liverpool’s pursuit of Huijsen, underlining the club’s ambitions to build on their recent success.\n\nBournemouth Braced for Huijsen Departure\n\nDavid Lynch revealed that Bournemouth are already resigned to losing the talented centre-back. “My understanding at the moment is that Bournemouth know that he is going to go, it’s just about where he ends up,” he explained.\n\nWith a £50 million release clause active this summer, Huijsen represents both a statement signing and a significant investment. Liverpool’s ability to now offer Champions League football, a fresh managerial project under Arne Slot, and the momentum of a title-winning campaign certainly strengthens their hand.\n\nWhile Bournemouth may not be actively pushing Huijsen out, it’s clear from Lynch’s comments that they are realistic about their situation: the player will depart, it’s just a question of which powerhouse wins the race.\n\nStiff Competition from Premier League Rivals\n\nOf course, Liverpool are not alone in their admiration. Lynch made it clear that the Reds face significant competition: “There’s a few clubs in the mix. Liverpool are in the race and they will have a very strong pitch to make to him, but we don’t know where that’s going to just yet.”\n\nChelsea and Arsenal have also declared their interest, setting up what looks like a fierce battle between England’s elite. While both London clubs can offer attractive projects, Liverpool’s recent domestic triumph and their clear pathway for young players under Slot could prove decisive.\n\nIt’s notable that Liverpool’s recruitment drive has been strategically focused on young, technically gifted talents — a profile that Huijsen fits perfectly. His calmness on the ball, reading of the game, and aerial prowess make him an ideal candidate to bolster Liverpool’s backline for years to come.\n\nWhy Huijsen Fits Liverpool’s Future Vision\n\nSecuring Dean Huijsen would not just be a win on the transfer front; it would be a clear signal of Liverpool’s intention to dominate a new era under Arne Slot. With Virgil van Dijk still commanding the defence but inevitably ageing, the need to phase in elite younger defenders becomes critical.\n\nGiven the open nature of the race, Liverpool’s strong internal structure, player development record, and sheer momentum post-title could sway Huijsen’s decision. The project under Slot is designed not just for short-term success but for sustainable excellence — a proposition that could appeal greatly to an ambitious young talent.\n\nAs Lynch rightly pointed out, “it’s an open race at the moment though, Chelsea and Arsenal are also interested,” but Liverpool are well-positioned to make an extremely compelling pitch.\n\nIf the Reds can secure Huijsen’s signature early in the window, it would set an exciting tone for the summer and show that their ambitions go far beyond just defending the Premier League crown. They are planning for a dynasty."}

The club, ever mindful of its rich tradition, moved quickly to ensure that the Champions Wall reflected this monumental success.\n\nNeeding only a point to mathematically secure the title, Liverpool found themselves in early trouble when Dominic Solanke put Spurs ahead. Yet the nerves didn’t last long. Goals from Luis Díaz, Alexis Mac Allister, Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah, and an own goal from Destiny Udogie turned the game firmly in the Reds’ favour.\n\nArne Slot’s side thus ensured the party stayed firmly at Anfield, rather than being postponed to a potential clincher next weekend at Stamford Bridge. Slot, in doing so, etched his name into Premier League history, becoming only the fifth manager to win the title in his debut season.\n\nAnfield’s Wall of Honour Grows\n\nImages posted by Sky Sports’ Vinny O’Connor on X captured the moment as workers updated the Champions Wall. The number 19, which had proudly marked Liverpool’s last league title under Jürgen Klopp five years ago, has now been replaced with a gleaming number 20.\n\nA second image posted later showed the ongoing work outside Anfield, highlighting just how much attention to detail the club places on its history and achievements. This swift action underscores the deep connection between the club, its fans, and its storied past.\n\nA Season to Remember\n\nLiverpool’s journey to their 20th Premier League title has been one of resilience and quality, a testament to Arne Slot’s seamless adaptation to life at Anfield. The team narrowly missed out on adding another League Cup to their tally, but that has not dulled the sense of achievement among players or supporters.\n\nThe Champions Wall inside the stadium will also soon be updated to reflect the club’s latest success. With four games still to play, Liverpool have given their fans reason to dream even bigger, as they mark another golden chapter in the Anfield story.\n\nFor a club that prides itself on history and success, this latest triumph is another reminder of Liverpool’s place at English football’s summit."}

Yet this time, unlike the muted, pandemic-shadowed triumph of 2020, the celebrations were visceral, raw, and long overdue. At Anfield, as Alexis Mac Allister’s goal sparked a deafening eruption, the release of a city’s pent-up longing was complete.\n\nThis title matters more than numbers or medals. It is the culmination of a journey through hardship, loss, and identity, led now by Arne Slot — a manager who arrived not to rip apart the past but to refine it with precision, authority, and a quiet, unshakeable belief.\n\nIt has been said before that football clubs mirror the fortunes of the cities they represent. Few clubs exemplify that better than Liverpool. This title, won before a full and raucous Anfield, is about restoration — of pride, of belonging, and of a sense of invincibility that had long been delayed.\n\nCalm Authority and Rebirth of Liverpool’s Culture\n\nSlot’s first act was not grand gestures or sweeping revolutions. He understood the weight of succeeding Jurgen Klopp but refused to imitate him. Where Klopp’s later years became increasingly fiery and centralised, Slot brought a collaborative breath of fresh air. His calm authority was obvious from the outset: a cool dismantling of complacency in training sessions, a ruthless but polite demand for higher standards, and an insistence that Liverpool’s culture could thrive only if everyone shared responsibility.\n\nPre-season setbacks, with key players missing due to summer tournaments, only highlighted Slot’s strengths. Personal calls to players weren’t saccharine chats; they were direct, challenging, laden with tactical demands. Virgil van Dijk and others didn’t stroll back into Kirkby expecting to be persuaded — they understood immediately that Slot was a teacher and a taskmaster.\n\nThe changes were small but profound. Breakfasts became communal events. A new coffee bar turned into the team’s social hub, fostering unity. Meetings multiplied — team-wide, unit-specific, and brutally honest one-to-ones. The message was clear: every detail mattered if Liverpool were to become champions again.\n\nAt the heart of it all was respect. Slot did not need to shout to be heard. His demands were consistent, his feedback detailed. His commitment to learning, and to teaching, shone through.\n\nTactical Tweaks, Not Tactical Revolutions\n\nArne Slot did not arrive at Liverpool to dismantle the foundations Klopp built. Instead, he tweaked where necessary, recalibrated the pressing game, and insisted on possession with control rather than chaos. Out went the frenetic, exhausting charges forward; in came elegant Dutch patterns of play, driven through a heart strengthened by midfielders like Curtis Jones and Mac Allister.\n\nSlot’s Liverpool built from the back with intelligence. Alisson and Van Dijk were tasked with creating 2-v-1 overloads from deep. Tracking back became non-negotiable, not merely a request. Running metrics improved, and every lapse in effort was ruthlessly exposed in video sessions that became as feared as they were respected.\n\nIt was never about embarrassment. It was about standards. Even Liverpool’s stars, from Salah to Szoboszlai, learned that no reputation protected you from Slot’s demand for improvement.\n\nSlot’s tactical genius shone most brightly when setbacks hit. Missing out on midfield target Martin Zubimendi late in the window could have sparked panic. Instead, Slot reimagined Ryan Gravenberch as a deep-lying controller, a decision as inspired as it was gutsy. Similarly, repositioning Cody Gakpo off the left revitalised the Dutchman’s influence.\n\nThis was management at its most artful — solving problems not with chequebooks, but with coaching.\n\nSetbacks like the early defeat to Nottingham Forest taught Slot valuable lessons about the Premier League’s unpredictability. By the season’s end, he spoke with clear-eyed respect about every opponent. No arrogance, just realism. That humility filtered down to the players.\n\nSquad Reinvigorated By New Demands\n\nMuch has been made of Liverpool’s “winning culture” under Klopp. But by 2024, that culture needed oxygen. It needed challenge. Slot provided both.\n\nHis style was demanding but human. Players like Salah, who had ended the previous season visibly frustrated and fractious, returned sharper, fitter, and more focused than ever. Slot’s individual coaching reignited Salah’s fire, but more importantly, it reframed his role: less obsessed with the Golden Boot, more committed to team success. Salah’s assists surged even as his goal tally remained fearsome.\n\nMeanwhile, fringe players understood their roles with clarity. Whether it was Wataru Endo seizing limited minutes as a ‘finisher’ off the bench, or youngsters like Jarell Quansah being coached through tough moments, Slot communicated openly and consistently. Nobody, whether star or squad player, was left guessing.\n\nFitness and injury prevention also improved dramatically. Training loads were better managed, recovery methods modernised, and players were simply fresher. The punishing late-season collapses of previous years never materialised. Liverpool were relentless.\n\nBehind the scenes, Slot also restored balance to the backroom environment. Staff who had felt marginalised during the final years of Klopp’s tenure were now re-empowered. Medical and sports science departments were given a louder voice. It was collaboration, not command.\n\nThe result? A squad fitter, happier, and better prepared to take the final steps toward glory.\n\nLiverpool Champions: Triumph Rooted In Identity\n\nThis Liverpool did not stumble to the title. They stormed it. Unbeaten runs, record-breaking wins over Manchester City, Real Madrid, and Bayer Leverkusen; clinical domination of the so-called “Big Six” — these were the hallmarks of a team meticulously prepared.\n\nSlot’s masterstroke came not in any one match but in the cultivation of resilience. When challenges came — a fog-delayed flight, a Carabao Cup final defeat, a draining Champions League exit — Liverpool absorbed the blows and marched on.\n\nPerhaps the defining image came at the Etihad, where Liverpool beat Manchester City with only 34% possession — a tactical dismantling achieved not through dominance, but discipline. It was, in many ways, the match that sealed the title psychologically. Even Pep Guardiola looked short of answers.\n\nThroughout, Slot remained Slot: no fist-pumps, no grandstanding. He promised connection through football, not theatrics, and delivered. The fans sang louder because of the football they were watching, not because of choreographed celebrations.\n\nWhen the final whistle blew against Tottenham, confirming Liverpool as Premier League champions, Anfield didn’t merely celebrate a season’s work. It celebrated a reclamation. The 2020 title, won in pandemic silence, had felt incomplete. This one rang through the city, through the generations, with a roar that felt like it might lift the Anfield Road stand clean off its foundations.\n\nThis title is about more than points. It is about a club and a city stitched together again after years of muted celebrations and what-ifs.\n\nLiverpool are champions again. Properly, gloriously, unforgettably.\n\nUnder Arne Slot, they look ready to dominate anew. And this time, the world will hear them."}

The West has apparently abandoned the idea that leaders ought to be men and women of character. In the past, leaders labored to control their appetites and impulses. Today, many extol men and women who have the resources and boldness to indulge every desire and unleash every impulse.\n\nOne day in 2023, the New York Times published two articles that invited readers to abandon the quest to be good. The first article, “I Don’t Need to Be a ‘Good Person,’” urged readers to “listen to your worst instincts and darkest desires.” In the second, “The Virtues of Being Bad,” sixteen writers confessed a range of offenses. At first, it was trivia like eating junk food. More ominously, they lie to strangers, practice shoplifting; and sleep with friends at random.\n\nJudging by widely read advice columns, most Americans live by a code that has just a few rules: Don’t break promises you make to your friends, don’t cheat on your partner (unless you agree on polyamory), and don’t exploit power differentials. People generally do what it takes to be happy—and to help family and friends find happiness, too. So they follow their heart, they cut off people who aren’t “life-giving,” and they seek authenticity.\n\nChristians have doubts about virtue, too. Some notice that the Bible speaks of God’s law hundreds of times and barely mentions virtue. The center of Christian morals is “submission to demands. . . . God calls and man obeys.” If that is true, then who needs virtue? All we need is a disposition to obey the law.\n\nGod’s character is the essence of virtue. The heart of virtue is to know the Lord and to become like him, as a child resembles her father. That is the goal, privilege, and destiny of the redeemed. Share\n\nMartin Luther also criticized virtue, saying that the journey of the redeemed is not from vice to virtue, but “from virtue to the grace of Christ.” Luther stated that the great enemy of the faith is not the “godless sinner” but the “righteous man” who dwells on his progress and swells with pride.\n\nIndeed, there is a kind of virtue that leads away from Jesus. The Pharisees suffered from it, as we see in Matthew 15:1–20. Clearly, it is time to define true virtue and to make a case for it.\n\nGod’s character is the essence of virtue. The heart of virtue is to know the Lord and to become like him, as a child resembles her father. That is the goal, privilege, and destiny of the redeemed. Romans 8:29 informs us that those whom God “foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son.” Believers should gradually resemble Jesus more and more.\n\nTo be like Jesus is both our destiny and God’s command. Paul told the Ephesians that they should imitate God: “Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us” (Eph. 4:32–5:2). Philippians 2 tells disciples to empty themselves of selfish ambition and self-interest because Jesus did so.

Several social media posts on Reddit and X also noted the price increases.\n\nTemu and Shein- which source a bulk of their goods from China- had so far been able to largely avoid paying import duties and trade tariffs due to an exemption on imports of goods worth less than $800, called “de minimis.” But Trump signed an executive order earlier in April that removed this exemption, with the order set to take effect from May 2.\n\nThis will leave all Chinese imports subject to tariffs going as high as 240%, after Trump signed a series of orders sharply increasing tariffs on China.\n\nBut the tariffs are expected to be borne by U.S. importers, and will likely be passed on to consumers.\n\nShein and PDD Holdings-owned (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu have shot up in popularity in the U.S. in recent years, especially among low-income, cost-conscious consumers, as the two largely undercut other ecommerce marketplaces with lower prices and a wide variety of consumer products.\n\nRelated articles\n\nShein, Temu hike US prices as Trump tariffs loom\n\nPeloton upgraded at Truist as profitability, growth outlook improves\n\nNio stock added to 30-day positive catalyst watch at Citi"}

ID:BX6Q9Vqs0\n\n工藤公康が避ける「2文字の言葉」野球中継の定番ワードに「曖昧すぎる」と持論\n\n4: それでも動く名無し 2025/04/28(月) 10:53:22.23 ID:BX6Q9Vqs0\n\nエラーやフォアボールが重なった場面で、よく野球中継では「流れが悪いですね」と言ったりするが、私は「流れ」という言葉が好きではない。\n\nそもそも流れが何を意味しているのか、曖昧すぎるからだ。\n\n\n\n「悪い流れを断ち切りました」「いい流れが来ています」「流れが変わりますよ」など、そんなふうに言われても、わかったようでわからない。\n\n今のエラーで流れが悪くなった。今のホームランで流れがよくなった。\n\nしかし、試合はそのワンプレーで負けるわけでも勝つわけでもない。\n\n\n\n「流れを言い換えると何ですか？」と聞くと「チームのムード」と答える人もいる。\n\nしかし、試合中にチームのムードがいいのか、悪いのか、外から見てわかるものではない。そうなると、流れがいいとも悪いとも言えないはずだ。\n\nあるいは、エラーもフォアボールもまったく気にしない明るいムードのチームなら、ずっといい流れのチームということになる。\n\n\n\n要するに、流れにしてもムードにしても、先ほど述べた集中力、あるいはモチベーション、やる気といったいろいろな選手の心理的な要素を1つの言葉にまとめたものに過ぎない。\n\n1から説明をするのが難しいので、一般的に通じる流れやムードという一言で済ませているのだろう。\n\n\n\nその意味では「野球に流れはない」と言ったほうが正確だ。\n\nどうしても抽象的な言葉になりがちだが、メンタルの部分の表現の仕方にしたほうが野球の面白さはより具体的に伝わるはずだ。\n\n9:

With Arne Slot set to embark on his first summer at the helm, the club’s recruitment plans are under the microscope. Among the many names linked with a move to Anfield, AFC Bournemouth’s Milos Kerkez has emerged as a prominent target.\n\nDavid Lynch, speaking to Dave Davis on Anfield Index, provided some valuable insight into the situation. While many fans have started to assume that Kerkez’s arrival is inevitable, Lynch poured a measure of cold water on those expectations.\n\nLiverpool’s Interest in Kerkez: Strong but Not Confirmed\n\n“He’s definitely a player that Liverpool like,” Lynch confirmed, but added, “I think because he has been linked for so long that people have started to assume that he is 100% coming but I don’t think we are in that situation yet.”\n\nThese comments underline the fact that, despite the strong interest, no deal is imminent. Bournemouth are reportedly demanding £45million for the Hungarian international, a significant fee that may influence Liverpool’s decision-making.\n\nIt’s crucial to remember that Liverpool’s recruitment process is meticulous. They cast a wide net and explore multiple options before committing. As Lynch emphasised, “I know people want as much certainty as possible but we’re still only in April and the season isn’t even over yet so it’s still early days.”\n\nCompetition and Alternatives: Not Just About Kerkez\n\nWhile Kerkez is highly rated, he is not Liverpool’s only option. Lynch revealed that Wolves’ Rayan Ait-Nouri is also under consideration. “They definitely do like him, so I’m not saying that he won’t sign but there is others that they like as well with one of them being Rayan Ait-Nouri at Wolves.”\n\nThis suggests that Liverpool are keeping their options open, ensuring that they make the best possible addition to a squad already bursting with quality following their latest title triumph. It is a hallmark of a club that has consistently operated shrewdly in the transfer market, balancing ambition with pragmatism.\n\nStrategic Squad Building Under Arne Slot\n\nSlot’s arrival marks a new chapter for Liverpool, but the club’s careful approach to transfers remains the same. The left-back position has been a point of mild concern in recent years, with injuries to key players such as Andy Robertson and Kostas Tsimikas highlighting the need for more depth.\n\nMilos Kerkez fits the profile of the kind of player Liverpool tend to favour: young, dynamic, and with plenty of room for development. However, the £45million valuation set by Bournemouth could complicate negotiations, especially when there are alternatives available who may offer better value.\n\nLiverpool will not rush into any decisions. As Lynch wisely pointed out, we are still in April, and with Euro 2024 on the horizon, player performances could yet impact valuations and availability. The coming months will be telling, but for now, the story of Milos Kerkez and Liverpool is one to watch, not to conclude."}

It was the default in Windows 95,¹ and I’ve stuck with that bluish-green background color ever since. It’s sort of like my comfort food.\n\nImagine my surprise when someone pointed me to a support article titled “The Welcome screen may be displayed for 30 seconds during the logon process after you set a solid color as the desktop background in Windows 7 or in Windows Server 2008 R2.” Why is logon slower with a solid background?\n\nAfter your logon has been authenticated, Windows sets up your desktop. There are a lot of things going on. The taskbar gets created. The components that are responsible for various system services are loaded and initialized. The desktop window is created and filled with icons. And the desktop background window loads up the desktop wallpaper and paints it to the screen.\n\nThe logon system waits for all of these pieces to report that they are ready, and when the all-clear signal is received from everybody, or when 30 seconds have elapsed, the logon system switches away from the Welcome screen.\n\nGiven that design, you can imagine the reason for the 30-second delay: It means that one of the pieces failed to report. Perhaps it was written like this:\n\nInitializeWallpaper() { if (wallpaper bitmap defined) { LoadWallpaperBitmap(); } } LoadWallpaperBitmap() { locate the bitmap on disk load it into memory paint it on screen Report(WallpaperReady); }\n\nThe code to report that the wallpaper is ready was inside the wallpaper bitmap code, which means that if you don’t have a wallpaper bitmap, the report is never made, and the logon system waits in vain for a report that will never arrive.\n\nLater in the article, it notes a related article that calls out that if you have the “Hide desktop icons” group policy enabled, then you might also suffer from the 30-second delay.\n\nGroup policies are susceptible to this problem because they tend to be bolted on after the main code is written. When you have to add a group policy, you find the code that does the thing, and you put a giant “if policy allows” around it.\n\n// Original code InitializeDesktopIcons() { bind to the desktop folder enumerate the icons add them to the screen Report(DesktopIconsReady); } // Updated with group policy support InitializeDesktopIcons() { if (desktop icons allowed by policy) { bind to the desktop folder enumerate the icons add them to the screen Report(DesktopIconsReady); } }\n\nOops, the scope of the “if” block extended past the report call, so if the policy is enabled, the icons are never reported as ready, and the logon system stays on the Welcome screen for the full 30 seconds.\n\nNote that in both of these cases, it’s not that the logon is extended by 30 seconds. Rather, the Welcome screen stays on for the full 30 seconds rather than the actual time it took for all systems to report ready (which could be 5 seconds, or it could be 25 seconds, depending on your system’s performance).\n\nIf you look at the timestamps on the articles, you can see that the problem was fixed in November 2009, just a few months after Windows 7 was released in July 2009.\n\n¹ Originally, I avoided bitmap backgrounds because they took up a lot of memory, and when you had only 4 or 8 megabytes of memory, eating three quarters of a megabyte of memory just for wallpaper was not a good return on investment.\n\nAlso, I tend to stick with default configurations because it makes bug filing easier. If the repro instructions are “install a system from scratch, then perform these steps”, you’re more likely to get traction than if you say “install a system from scratch, change these 50 settings from their defaults, and then perform these additional steps.” It’s much easier to justify a bug fix that affects the default configuration than a bug fix that requires that the user have changed settings from the default, particularly if those settings are obscure."}

According to Jason Seidl of TD Cowen, ocean freight data from Asia to the U.S. has seen a steep drop, with volumes down by 30% on the West Coast and 12% on the East Coast. The decline is attributed to several major retailers halting the shipment of non-essential items from China temporarily, due to the ongoing tariff paralysis which continues to impact the transportation sector and the broader economy negatively.\n\nThe firm’s industry contacts have observed similar trends, with a North American ocean forwarder and intermodal player witnessing a 30% drop in container volumes on the West Coast and a 12% decrease on the East Coast. Retail and apparel customers are reportedly ceasing shipments of non-essential goods from China temporarily. Furthermore, Kuehne & Nagel (SIX:KNIN) International AG confirmed significant declines in outbound ocean freight from China on their first-quarter call, and these declines are beginning to affect U.S. ports.\n\nThe spring season is typically vital for U.S. imports as it follows a post-holiday lull and precedes the summer essential goods import and back-to-school planning. However, the freight market is currently experiencing a \"volume air pocket\" as the robust volumes seen earlier in the first quarter have given way to sharp declines. Macro data indicates that inventory levels had been rising ahead of the tariff increase, with the ISM Manufacturing Inventories index hitting an expansionary phase in March at 53.4, a level not seen since 2022.\n\nThe TD Cowen Rail Survey revealed that 44% of respondents had moved goods ahead of tariffs early in the year. However, the survey also indicated that the amount of goods pulled forward was limited and unlikely to sustain the approximately one month of tariff paralysis already experienced. According to the survey, 48% of shippers pulling freight forward moved only 0%-5% of their volume, 33% moved between 5%-10%, and 16% moved between 10%-15%. This suggests that rail and truck volumes could face significant pressure in the coming weeks, potentially leading to adverse headlines for the transport sector.\n\nRelated articles\n\nWest Coast ports see 30% decline in freight volume amid tariffs, TD Cowen says\n\nCapital Economics deciphers Canada’s post-election economy\n\nWells Fargo sees Canada slipping into recession as tariffs weigh on growth"}

The outlook for the Google parent remains stable.\n\nProceeds from the new debt issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of outstanding obligations. Moody’s cited Alphabet’s dominant positions in search, YouTube, Android, and digital advertising as key strengths underpinning the rating.\n\nAs of March 31, 2025, the company held approximately $95 billion in cash and marketable securities. Alphabet also maintains a low debt load, with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of just 0.23x, highlighting its conservative financial profile.\n\nThe agency noted Alphabet’s scale, profitability, and commitment to research and development as contributing factors to its financial resilience. Free cash flow is projected to reach $67 billion this year, with expected revenue growth of 10%.\n\nAlphabet’s liquidity is further supported by a $10 billion commercial paper program and $10 billion of undrawn credit facilities. Moody’s said the company’s ability to generate consistent and substantial cash flow remains a core strength.\n\nHowever, Moody’s also warned of risks to the business, including the cyclical nature of advertising, emerging competitive threats, and sustained regulatory pressure. Legal challenges to Google’s search dominance resulted in rulings labeling the company as an illegal monopolist in both the U.S. and Europe.\n\nRemedies from those rulings, delivered in March 2025 and August 2024 respectively, are likely to be finalized in the second half of this year. Moody’s indicated that the outcomes could have material implications for Alphabet’s business model if enforcement measures are far-reaching.\n\nDespite those risks, the rating agency expects Alphabet to maintain its market leadership while adhering to disciplined financial practices. The stable outlook reflects confidence that Alphabet can navigate regulatory headwinds without materially weakening its business.\n\nMoody’s said an upgrade could occur if Alphabet sustains conservative financial policies and effectively manages regulatory and legal outcomes. Conversely, a downgrade could result from deterioration in its core search business, major legal or regulatory disruption, or a pivot to more aggressive financial strategies.\n\nRelated articles\n\nMoody’s affirms Alphabet’s Aa2 rating, citing strong financial footing\n\nRheinmetall shares surge after preliminary first-quarter sales beat estimates\n\nBakkavor shares edge up on China operations sale deal"}

However, the ratings agency maintained a negative outlook due to ongoing uncertainty around the pace of recovery in aircraft deliveries.\n\nBoeing reported stabilized output of the 737 MAX, producing aircraft in the low 30s per month with plans to ramp up to 38 soon. The company is also seeking FAA approval to lift that rate to 42 by year-end, after resolving prior quality control issues and supply chain disruptions.\n\nFirst-quarter deliveries included 105 737 MAX jets and 13 787 Dreamliners, reflecting a firming of operations after production headwinds. Airline demand has remained resilient, providing Boeing with tailwinds for increased manufacturing.\n\nOn the defense side, Boeing reported no new charges in Q1 and saw operating margins reach 2.5%. Continued progress on its MQ-25 and T-7A programs, as well as a recent win in the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance program, support greater confidence in long-term defense profitability.\n\nBoeing’s largely U.S.-based manufacturing footprint has mitigated the impact of tariff tensions and allowed continued progress on aircraft assembly. The company is working to reallocate around 50 aircraft originally built for Chinese customers, holdovers from frozen deliveries due to geopolitical strains.\n\nThe balance sheet remains fortified, with $23.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q1. Liquidity has been further supported by a $24.3 billion equity raise in October and a planned $10 billion divestiture of its aviation software division.\n\nDebt remains a looming concern, with $1.3 billion maturing in 2025 and $8 billion in 2026. Additionally, the pending acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) could bring about $4 billion in consolidated debt onto Boeing’s books.\n\nDespite improvements, S&P maintained a cautious view, citing the risk of persistent supply chain constraints, regulatory uncertainty, and execution setbacks. A downgrade could occur if Boeing fails to meet projected cash flow and leverage targets over the next two years.\n\nThe outlook could stabilize if Boeing demonstrates sustained growth in commercial aircraft production, achieves margin expansion in defense, and executes on debt reduction. Until then, investors are likely to remain watchful of the company’s execution and recovery progress.\n\nRelated articles\n\nBoeing outlook remains negative as S&P cites recovery risks"}

Of course, no amount of official sets can keep up with all the games being released on PC and consoles. Fortunately, there are plenty of amazing builders making custom versions of game characters we love.\n\nKamil Karpiński is a builder we’ve spotlighted several times for his bolstered figs that integrate brick anatomy with minifig heads. For this tribute to From Software’s cult classic Bloodborne, the builder sticks with classic minifig parts and perfectly captures the Victorian horror aesthetic of the game. The rubber band wrapped around the sawtooth blade and the extra buckles on the arm really sell it.\n\nbeyondb0nes also found inspiration in Bloodborne with this minifig take on Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower.\n\nSticking to From Software, Falcon Figs celebrates Elden Ring’s folk hero Let Me Solo Her in LEGO form. This absolute legend is a player who lets others summon him into their game to kill the game’s toughest bosses solo. Its stories like this that make me love gaming.\n\nI shared this one a while back, but it’s a build that always brings a smile when it shows up. This is poodooMOCs‘ take on Starscourge Radahn from Elden Ring. The character design is so absurd that only the head is a minifig part, but it is at minifig scale so I’ll allow it.\n\nOne last From Software tribute, this time to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Aris (bricks.for_bricks) expands on their usual minifig only builds with a full vignette capturing the hero’s battle against the hideous (in appearance and name) Long-arm Centipede Giraffe miniboss.\n\nThere’s been a new Assassin’s Creed game every year or two, but fans keep returning to the hero of Assassin’s Creed 2 (which become its own trilogy) with hero Ezio and its Renaissance Italy setting. Expansion Bricks builds an older Ezio using all official parts. That red sash? It’s paper cut from a LEGO store bag!\n\nBrennan (brickbot_studio) excells at both figs and brick-built bots. Today we’re showcasing the latter with this bot and turret from Portal. The turret design is a showstopper, brilliantly employing roller scates for the guns to keep to minifig scale.\n\nLectrius has been on a Metal Gear kick lately. I especially love his retro take on the cast of the original Metal Gear Solid. While not completely purist, it’s great too see builders who celebrate LEGO’s classic yellow faces in newer builds.\n\nFinally, Shulika_27 is a builder who creates so many amazing dark fantasy creations that look like they’re lifted from a a game, but are actually original creations. Here’s a tribute to an actual game – Chess! The mostly greyscale ensemble of ashen playing pieces form an ensemble crackling with personality.\n\nUntil next week, game over man, game over.\n\nRelated"}

If it uses the phrase “in today’s challenging environment,” a robot did it! On and on, tips for sniffing out AI that begin to sound more like articles of faith than helpful advice, a search for human connection in a time of technological uncertainty.\n\nAs a writer and editor who reads submissions from writers every day, I understand these concerns. In the early days of AI, I used to try to read the tea leaves to determine whether or not something was AI. It worried me! I want to give my readers the best. Could a robot really do that? Of course not.\n\nI was so confident that a few times, I asked people, as kindly as I could: Did you use AI to write this?\n\nAnd every time, the answer was no.\n\nEventually, I came to the realization that it doesn’t matter if AI wrote the content I was reading, just like it didn’t matter if they wrote it in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, whether they used Bing or Google to do their research. What ultimately mattered was, did the piece do what it needed to do?\n\nIf it did, then did it matter if there was an AI assist?\n\nNow, I believe that at this moment, in the second quarter of 2025, humans will succeed in that goal more than AI will. Generative AI, in its current state, is an aggregation of massive amounts of data written by humans. It can only rearrange those pieces like a giant Mad Lib. It isn’t capable of creating anything truly new.\n\nBut in many cases, neither are humans. I read rehashed submissions long before AI came onto the scene, just like people used em dashes before ChatGPT was invented.\n\nUltimately, whether a piece was whipped up by a robot with a great prompt or painstakingly written letter by letter by a human doesn’t matter. Here’s what does:\n\nIs the piece accurate? These are table stakes. If the content isn’t trustworthy, nothing else matters. And both AI and people have their struggles in this regard.\n\nThese are table stakes. If the content isn’t trustworthy, nothing else matters. And both AI and people have their struggles in this regard. Is the piece interesting or useful? Not every piece of content is going to have you on the edge of your seat — nor should it. But it should, generally, either entice you with great storytelling or give you the information that you need. Otherwise, why does it exist?\n\nNot every piece of content is going to have you on the edge of your seat — nor should it. But it should, generally, either entice you with great storytelling or give you the information that you need. Otherwise, why does it exist? Is the piece ethical? If AI is writing about some human emotion it can’t experience, that’s a problem. If its use isn’t transparent, that’s an issue. If it’s stealing content, that’s an issue. But humans lying about facts is also an issue. Keep it all above board.\n\nIf AI is writing about some human emotion it can’t experience, that’s a problem.

But whether we’re talking about an anecdote, a flash of humor or personalization, something about the content should stand out. Does the piece achieve its goal? Content can be designed to inform, persuade, move to action, entertain and on and on. If it’s an educational piece that doesn’t teach the audience anything, it isn’t successful.\n\nIn other words, communicators should focus more on how content is received than how it’s created. You can achieve this through all the usual methods: analyzing page views, read time, email open rates, pulse surveys or tracking when journalists respond to your pitches. Or heck, you could just show it to another human and ask for their opinion the old-fashioned way.\n\nAI isn’t the enemy. Bad content is. No matter who the author is.\n\nAllison Carter is editorial director of PR Daily and Ragan.com. Follow her on LinkedIn."}

Even though they went on sale back in November, ever since Sonoko’s post, they’ve been picking up steam (in the figurative sense–most certainly not in the literal one) and repeatedly selling out.\n\n▼ “My eyes are really bad, and because that makes it tough when I take a bath, I bought some special glasses for that purpose. The lenses are thankfully included. Plus, they’re cute!”\n\nSold by eyewear maker Megane Store, the glasses are actually a collaboration product to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Kerorin, a company that produces the ubiquitous yellow plastic tubs found in all manner of baths across Japan. They play up the design of the tubs with their accompanying yellow case, yellow color accents, and red lettering that spells out “Kerorin” in more than one place.\n\n▼ A typical Kerorin plastic tub\n\nThe glasses were originally developed to improve the experience of people taking baths–whether in private or public–who have trouble seeing things clearly without their glasses or contact lenses on. Unlike regular glasses that are quick to fog up, easy to become overheated, and are made using metal parts susceptible to rusting, these ones have a special lens coating that makes it difficult for fog to accumulate. Furthermore, the frames and lenses are also made from non-metal materials that are heat resistant up to 120 degrees Celsius (248 degrees Fahrenheit). Finally, the case’s design incorporates a small drainage hole at the base so that the glasses can dry off quickly if any water gets inside.\n\nIf you’ve soaked all of this up and are ready to buy a pair of bath-use glasses for yourself, they’re currently available to purchase at Megane Store’s online shop or Rakuten Japan starting at 6,578 yen (US$45.98). They come in three frame color choices (yellow, clear, and black) and five levels of lens strength (-2.00, -3.00, -4.00, -5.00, and -6.00 diopters).\n\nFor the record, we’d like to share that our team has also developed our own novel method of preventing steam on glasses by instead freezing them inside of a block of ice. We’ll leave it up to you which method you choose to pursue.\n\nSource: Maido na News via Hachima Kiko\n\nTop image: Pakutaso\n\nInsert image: Pakutaso\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

Whether you’re a student managing coursework, a professional tackling demanding tasks, or a casual user browsing the web, this device is tailored to meet a wide range of needs. With its upgraded features, refined design, and competitive pricing, the M4 MacBook Air stands out as a compelling choice for anyone seeking a reliable and efficient laptop. The video below from SaranByte gives us more details.\n\nPerformance Built for Today’s Needs\n\nAt the heart of the M4 MacBook Air is the M4 chipset, a innovative processor designed to handle a variety of tasks with remarkable efficiency. From running productivity applications to editing photos or engaging in light creative work, the M4 chipset ensures smooth and responsive performance. Its fanless design not only keeps the laptop whisper-quiet but also eliminates the risk of overheating, contributing to its long-term durability.\n\nOne of the most notable upgrades is the support for dual external displays, a feature that addresses a key limitation of earlier MacBook Air models. This enhancement is particularly beneficial for professionals who rely on multitasking across multiple screens, making the M4 MacBook Air a versatile tool for productivity. Whether you’re managing spreadsheets, editing videos, or conducting virtual meetings, this laptop is equipped to handle it all with ease.\n\nRefined and Portable Design\n\nThe M4 MacBook Air features a sleek and lightweight chassis that combines functionality with aesthetic appeal.

This app consolidates all your credentials into one secure location, offering enhanced functionality and protection. Whether you need to retrieve a password, manage passkeys, or securely share credentials, the Passwords app provides a streamlined and efficient solution. Understanding how to use this app effectively can significantly improve your digital security and convenience.\n\nHow to find saved passwords and passkeys in the Passwords app on iPhone and iPad\n\nSecure Access to the Passwords App\n\nThe Passwords app is built with security as a top priority, making sure that only you can access your sensitive information. To open the app, you must authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID, or your device passcode. For instance, if you’re using Face ID, the app scans your face to verify your identity before granting access. These biometric authentication methods not only enhance security but also provide a seamless user experience, eliminating the need to remember additional passwords. By requiring this level of authentication, the app ensures that your credentials remain protected, even if your device is lost or stolen.\n\nEfficiently Searching for Saved Credentials\n\nLocating specific passwords or passkeys in the Passwords app is designed to be quick and intuitive. The app includes a search bar where you can type the name of the website or app associated with the credential you need. For example, if you’re looking for the login details for your email account, simply enter the name of your email provider. Additionally, Siri integration allows for hands-free assistance. By saying, “Hey Siri, show my password for [website or app name],” you can instantly access the information you need without navigating through the app manually. These features save time and reduce the hassle of scrolling through extensive lists of saved entries.\n\nViewing, Copying, and Managing Credentials\n\nOnce you locate the credential you need, the Passwords app allows you to view or copy it for immediate use. For example, if you’re logging into a website on another device, you can copy the password directly from the app and paste it where needed. The app also supports passkeys, which are a more secure alternative to traditional passwords. Passkeys use cryptographic keys for authentication, making them highly resistant to phishing attacks. By managing these passkeys within the app, you ensure they are securely stored and readily accessible whenever required. This functionality enhances both security and convenience, particularly as passkeys become more widely adopted.\n\nShared Password Groups for Collaboration\n\nA standout feature introduced in iOS 18 is the ability to create shared password groups. This feature allows you to securely share credentials with family members, colleagues, or other trusted individuals. For instance, you can set up a shared group for your household’s streaming service accounts, allowing everyone to access them without compromising security. These groups are managed directly within the Passwords app, giving you full control over who can view or edit the shared credentials. You can also remove individuals from the group at any time, making sure that access remains limited to trusted parties. This feature simplifies collaboration while maintaining robust security for shared accounts.\n\nAdvanced Tools for Organization and Search\n\nThe Passwords app includes advanced tools to improve the organization and accessibility of your credentials. You can categorize saved entries into groups, such as work-related accounts or personal subscriptions, making it easier to locate specific credentials. Additionally, the app offers advanced search filters, allowing you to narrow results based on criteria like account type, creation date, or last modified date. These organizational tools are particularly useful for users with a large number of saved entries, making sure that you can quickly find the information you need without unnecessary effort. By combining these features with the app’s robust security measures, Apple has created a comprehensive solution for managing digital credentials.\n\nStreamlined Credential Management for Enhanced Security\n\nThe Passwords app in iOS 18 represents a significant step forward in credential management. By integrating robust security features like biometric authentication with user-friendly tools for searching, viewing, and sharing credentials, the app enables you to take control of your digital security. Whether you’re managing traditional passwords or adopting passkeys, the Passwords app offers a centralized, secure, and efficient solution for all your credential needs. Its intuitive design and advanced functionality make it an essential tool for anyone looking to enhance their online security and simplify the management of their digital accounts.\n\nExpand your understanding of Passwords app iOS 18 with additional resources from our extensive library of articles.\n\nSource & Image Credit: Apple Support\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.
