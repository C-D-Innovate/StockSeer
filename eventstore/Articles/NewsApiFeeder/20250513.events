Amazon represents one of the most compelling cases for such a mindset. While many still perceive it merely as an e-commerce platform, that view is outdated and misses the company’s real engine: Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud business with an annual run rate exceeding $90 billion and operating margins of 25–30%. AWS powers global giants like Netflix and Zoom, while its AI workloads and custom chips (Trainium, Inferentia) are driving future innovation. Alongside AWS is Amazon’s logistics network, a vertically integrated infrastructure that rivals UPS and FedEx, enabling nearly unmatched delivery speeds and deep ecosystem integration via programs like Prime and Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA). With over 200 million global Prime members, Amazon leverages this reach across offerings like Prime Video, Alexa, and Buy with Prime, reinforcing user engagement and seller stickiness. Advertising, often overlooked, is another juggernaut, generating over $45 billion annually—built not just on web traffic, but on Amazon’s rich intent-driven data, powering search and display ads and rapidly scaling on platforms like Fire TV. This high-margin business is growing faster than ad leaders like Google and Meta. Collectively, Amazon isn’t just a retailer—it’s a digital economy platform comprised of five interlinked category leaders: retail, cloud, logistics, ads, and subscriptions. Each segment throws off significant cash, reinforces the others, and continues to grow, creating an economic flywheel that few companies can replicate. In an environment where selective greed is justified, Amazon stands out as a foundational asset offering resilience, innovation, and long-term compounding. It’s not just one business—it’s a portfolio of dominant franchises, each with deep moats and asymmetric upside potential.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 339 hedge fund portfolios held AMZN at the end of the fourth quarter which was 286 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock."}

A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that it’s laying off about 3% of its global workforce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith around 228,000 employees worldwide, the move will impact nearly 7,000 people — making it the company’s largest round of layoffs since it cut 10,000 roles in early 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft framed the move as part of “organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” (What, not “vibrant” or “robust”?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike a smaller round of performance-based cuts in January, these layoffs are not tied to individual performance. A Microsoft spokesperson said the company is working to reduce layers of management and adjust its structure amid ongoing platform shifts.\n\nCompany cuts despite double-digit sales growth\n\nThe news comes just weeks after Microsoft delivered what Wedbush dubbed an “Aaron Judge-like” earnings performance that helped reset the narrative around AI monetization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevenue hit $70.1 billion, up 13%, with Azure and other cloud revenue growing 33% year-over-year, a better clip than some analysts predicted. Nearly half of that cloud growth came from AI workloads.\n\nMicrosoft stock is up around 6% year to date, and up over 200% since the pandemic-era stock lows of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe larger tech industry’s total reset\n\nThe tech industry has been through a sweeping labor reset since 2023, when giants like Amazon (AMZN-2.87% ), Meta (META-2.36% ), and Google (GOOGL-1.57% ) began unwinding what some observers believed was pandemic-era overhiring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazon cut more than 27,000 roles in waves, Meta laid off over 21,000 employees during its so-called “year of efficiency,” and Microsoft eliminated 10,000 positions, marking its biggest workforce reduction in years. Google’s parent company Alphabet let go of 12,000 employees, while Salesforce (CRM-0.74% ), Spotify (SPOT+5.12% ), and Lyft (LYFT-1.87% ) also trimmed deeply.\n\nBy 2024, layoffs grew more selective as leadership leaned into artificial intelligence and long-term profitability. Mass cuts gave way to more surgical trims, with companies saying sayonara to low-priority initiatives or those misaligned with fresh strategic visions. Meta pulled back in Reality Labs and infrastructure, Amazon slimmed down parts of AWS and retail tech, and Salesforce restructured to “focus on the core,” often shorthand for shedding teams that no longer fit the investor story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the headline-grabbing rounds mostly subsided, the pruning seems to have never really stopped. Tech firms have quietly kept reshaping their org charts, thinning layers, and reallocating headcount toward AI-driven bets. White-collar workers’ group chats everywhere remain alight with news of cuts or threatened cuts. Tuesday’s move by Microsoft slots cleanly into the narrative."}
