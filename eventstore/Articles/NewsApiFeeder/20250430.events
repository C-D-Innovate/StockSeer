New episodes every week.\n\nSean Jacobsohn , partner at Norwest Venture Partners and founder of the Failure Museum, takes us on a tour of notable product failures, sharing insights into why they failed and the lessons we can learn from them. Discover the six forces of failure and learn how companies can avoid making the same mistakes.\n\nHANNAH BATES: Welcome to HBR On Strategy—case studies and conversations with the world’s top business and management experts, hand-selected to help you unlock new ways of doing business.\n\nEver heard of the Failure Museum? It’s home to more than one thousand relics of failed business ventures—like the Heinz Tomato Ketchup Cookbook, Bic’s pencil just for women, and a stock certificate from Lehman Brothers. While these flops and washouts might be fun to laugh at, they hold powerful lessons for business leaders.\n\nIn this episode, museum founder and venture capitalist Sean Jacobsohn identifies six forces of failure—from bad timing to poor financial management—with the help of artifacts from his cautionary collection. Along the way, you’ll learn how your company can avoid making the same costly mistakes.\n\nBy the way, if you want to see the items Jacobsohn talks about, go to HBR’s YouTube channel, where you’ll find the video version of this episode.\n\nHere’s Jacobsohn.\n\nSEAN JACOBSOHN: I have a lot of favorites. The Pets.com sock puppet from 1998, they could have been successful if they didn’t build a money-losing business. Harley Davidson Cologne from 1996, it reeked the scent of tobacco. Here’s an unopened bottle. No, they weren’t joking. They were serious about it. They did a lot of product extensions, of course. Sparkling water, Cheetos lip balm.\n\nAnother one of my favorites is Allan from 1964. He was Ken’s best friend. You may remember him from the Barbie movie.\n\nALLAN: Hi Barbie!\n\nBARBIE: Oh, hi Allan.\n\nSEAN JACOBSOHN: Here he is in the original box. Allan wore the same clothing. He was his best friend. The problem is everyone just wanted to own Ken, not Allan. Yes, I have two cans of New Coke. You want me to bring them out? It was really hard to switch people in mass to something completely different. I have not tasted one. I certainly have been tempted, but some of these things are 15, 20, 30 years old, so they probably don’t taste good anymore.\n\nI’m Sean Jacobsohn, partner at Norwest Venture Partners. I’m on 14 boards. I’m also the founder and curator of the Failure Museum. The Failure Museum has over 1,000 items and continues to grow. Failed companies, failed products, failed sports-related items, and failed toys. I’ve tagged all 1,000 items of mine to one or two forces of failure.\n\nProduct market fit, team, financial management, timing, competition, and customer success. I’m going to go through all six forces of failure and share one example of each. I have a champagne bottle from Webvan’s IPO date in 1999. For product market fit, Webvan is a good example. They were the world’s first grocery delivery company.\n\nSPEAKER 4: You have the right to come home from work and find something good waiting for you in the fridge.\n\nSEAN JACOBSOHN: They raised over $880 million to launch in 10 cities before having proven one. Business model required so much capital. They had distribution centers. They hired their own drivers, which is why they had to raise $880 million. Not enough demand for the early version of your product. You shouldn’t yet scale go to market.\n\nSo I have a Theranos mug, and I also have Elizabeth Holmes’ business card. Their goal was to revolutionize the blood-testing industry, and at the peak were worth $10 billion. Theranos didn’t have a strong team or board. None of them had domain expertise. They tried to use a pinprick of blood to do testing, and that’s just not enough data. Yeah, when they don’t have domain expertise, hiring other people without domain expertise, you believe in something can be possible when it really isn’t.\n\nHere is a copy of the Google Glass, and I can put it on here too. A good example of customer success is Google Glass. They did not pick the right early customers well. They started with doctors, and doctors could see patient records on the Glass while they were talking to the patient. So they didn’t have to use their computer. It felt invasive.\n\nIt didn’t seem very personal, and you’re not used to having someone with a strange device on your face trying to communicate with you. Because it lacked the cool factor, they couldn’t find any other segments of the population that wanted to wear something like this. It’s important to pick the right early customers that are representative of your bigger market. A lot of times people pick the most convenient customers rather than those that are going to help you build a big business. I love this one so much that I actually bought two of them on eBay.\n\nFor financial management, the ESPN mobile phone. They launched a year before the iPhone. All the phone did was calling, sharing ESPN mobile content and scores. They burned through $150 million, including several Superbowl ads. It only hit 6% of a sales target. They probably should have had more capabilities on the phone. There just wasn’t enough to do on the phone.\n\nSPEAKER 5: Introducing Mobile ESPN. Sports fans, your phone has arrived.\n\nSEAN JACOBSOHN: I have a couple items here, a WeWork Thermos and a koozie from WeWorks summer camp. For timing, a good example is WeWork. WeWorks in the coworking space business. And when the pandemic hit, the demand for office space fell off a cliff and they ended up burning through $16 billion. The goal was to give people flexible space that allowed you to do month-to-month leases and scale up and down in space depending on your demand.\n\nThey also signed 10 to 15 year leases at peak market prices, and then they ended up renting them out at a loss. There’s some level of unluckiness, but I think that they had the wrong business model. You need to have a pulse on what’s happening in the market and be able to anticipate what’s going to happen in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\nAnd so I’ve had several friends donate their Blockbuster membership card to me. And then in every store there was a sign that said, “Be kind, rewind.” For competition, Blockbuster’s a good example. They’re in the movie rental business. At the peak, they had 9,000 stores. They missed the opportunity to move online and Netflix ate their lunch. They also, after they went public, had the opportunity to buy Netflix for $50 million and turned it down and instead Netflix ended up beating them.\n\nWhen I talk about competition, you need to make sure that you don’t have an upstart competitor that offers a cheaper, better way of doing what you do. You need to be aware of all the competitors in your market segment and how you stay differentiated and better than them.\n\nI do admire companies for taking risks and trying new things. Some of these big risks turn into humongous outcomes and some fail spectacularly. I’m a lot of times surprised at the lack of research that they did before they spent a lot of money to roll something out that wasn’t going to work.\n\nHANNAH BATES: That was Sean Jacobsohn, partner at Norwest Venture Partners and founder of the Failure Museum.\n\nWe’ll be back next Wednesday with another hand-picked conversation about business strategy from the Harvard Business Review.

Whatever the new features are, I know I’ll be buying one. Why? Because of a poor choice I made with my M4 model.\n\nNew M5 iPad Pro coming later this year\n\nIt’s shaping up to be a strong year for the iPad. We’ve already gotten an M3 iPad Air (currently $100 off) and new base iPad. iPadOS 19 will reportedly bring big upgrades like a Mac-style menu bar and overhauled Stage Manager.\n\nAnd this fall, the M5 iPad Pro is expected to launch alongside a huge lineup of other new products.\n\nOther than the M5 chip, very little is known about this new iPad. Perhaps it will come with enhancements specifically related to new iPadOS 19 features.\n\nEven with minimal rumored details so far, I already know the M5 iPad Pro is in my future.\n\nWhy? Because I regret skipping the nano-texture option on my M4 model.\n\nHidden costs of nano-texture kept me from making the upgrade\n\nApple launched the M4 iPad Pro last year with several compelling upgrades, like an ultra-thin new design, beautiful tandem OLED display, and improved Magic Keyboard.\n\nIt also, unfortunately, raised the iPad Pro’s price significantly. You can regularly find discounts online, but it’s still a very premium product.\n\nOne of the new features of the M4 iPad Pro was its support for nano-texture display glass.\n\nI strongly considered the $100 upgrade at the time, but ultimately declined. My 13-inch iPad Pro with new Magic Keyboard was already pricey enough.\n\nPlus, the nano-texture option came with another very expensive requirement: in addition to the $100 surcharge, it was only available on models with 1TB of storage or more.\n\nI only needed the 512GB model, meaning an upgrade to nano-texture would take my total from $1,499 all the way up to $1,999.\n\nEven though I use the iPad as my full-time computer, $2,000 is still a jaw-dropping price tag.\n\nSplurging on an M5 iPad Pro with nano-texture display\n\nIn my early time with the M4 iPad Pro, I was happy with my decision to skip nano-texture.\n\nThe ‘Ultra Retina XDR’ display gets bright enough that it’s fairly usable in sunlight, even without nano-texture glass.\n\nBut after reading articles like this, and spending much more time working in sunny environments than I anticipated, I’ve grown to regret my M4 decision.\n\nUsing my iPad in the sun with virtually zero glare sounds amazing.\n\nIt should also, in theory, extend battery life on the go since I won’t need to crank the brightness so much.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope Apple has some compelling upgrades in store for the M5 iPad Pro. And that I can get decent trade-in value for my M4 model. I may even try being less stingy with storage management on my iPad.\n\nAll for the sake of not feeling guilty about splurging for an M5 iPad Pro with nano-texture display.\n\nDo you have nano-texture glass on any of your devices? Is it worth it? Let us know in the comments.\n\nBest iPad accessories"}

Early in my SEO career, I generated two million clicks for an ecommerce store. The client and I were thrilled. The graph on Google Search Console was trending strongly up.\n\nThe problem? I couldn’t quantify a single sale from two million visitors. I had no idea how to generate a keyword strategy for buyers.\n\nI learned my lesson the hard way. Now, everything I do in SEO is centered around the buyer and the end goal: a sale. Using buyer journey keywords, I can better quantify the value of my work. I know which landing page converts and which keywords influence sales, and I can quantify the monetary contribution articles had on sales. Keep reading to learn how.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Role of the Buyer's Journey in Keyword Research\n\nSource\n\nThe buyer’s journey includes the steps a potential buyer will take before they purchase. SEOs who want to serve buyers and sell products or services need to understand the buyer journey to effectively strategize content.\n\nGenerally, the buyer journey will have three stages:\n\nIdentification = pain and problem awareness\n\npain and problem awareness Consideration = solution awareness\n\nsolution awareness Decision = provider aware\n\nKeyword Research Template Build your SEO strategy with this free template. Search Volume\n\nSearch Volume CPC\n\nCPC Ranking\n\nRanking Keyword Difficulty Download the Free Template Learn more Download the Free Template Download Free All fields are required. You're all set! Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now\n\nSometimes, it’s represented in a funnel, known as the marketing or conversion funnel. I’ve placed an image of one below. You may also know these stages as:\n\nAwareness = Top of Funnel (ToFu)\n\n= Top of Funnel (ToFu) Consideration = Middle of Funnel (MoFu)\n\n= Middle of Funnel (MoFu) Conversion = Bottom of Funnel (BoFu)\n\nUnderstanding buyer’s journey keywords will pivot your SEO strategy from clicks to revenue, which matters for every business. Google is serving more of your potential buyers with AI overviews, which appear in 47% of results. Now, people can just read the AIO without clicking a link. So, SEOs must be tactical to win clicks and conversions.\n\nKeyword Intents for Each Buyer's Journey Stage\n\nEach buyer journey stage has a separate need that you need to meet by matching the right keywords to the right stage. Meeting the buyer at different stages on their journey isn’t always about sealing the deal but building relationships.\n\nIn the State of Marketing survey, HubSpot found that marketers believe that building connections across the buyer’s journey and developing relationships at scale introduces new operational needs.\n\nAwareness\n\nThe buyer has identified a problem but doesn’t fully understand it or doesn’t know a solution exists. They are seeking general information or education to clarify the issue. This stage is about discovery and research.\n\nThis stage of the buyer journey needs helpful, educational content to better understand the problem or opportunity.\n\nKeywords for this buyer journey will be problem-based and question-driven, such as “how to,” “why does,” or “what is.” These terms align with the buyer’s intent to learn and explore their situation without feeling sold to.\n\nHere’s an example of a buyer in the awareness stage and the keywords to support them.\n\nConsider that a buyer in the awareness stage is using keywords about a problem. For example, a sales manager might research:\n\nWhy doesn’t my team follow up with leads?\n\nHow to motivate a sales team.\n\nProcesses to manage leads.\n\nDuring this stage, content wants to educate the buyer. While this top-of-funnel content might not seem the most impactful for sales, according to Hubspot’s State of Marketing survey, the website and blog are some of the most effective channels for ROI.\n\nConsideration\n\nThe buyer understands the problem and is exploring different approaches or solutions. They are actively researching options and comparing them.\n\nThis stage of the buyer journey needs solutions and guidance on which route might be best for them.\n\nKeywords for this buyer journey will be comparison and solution-oriented keywords like “best tools for,” “top strategies,” “[solution] versus [solution]” or “solution to [problem].” These help your content show up when the buyer is evaluating ways to solve their issue.\n\nHere’s an example of a buyer in the consideration stage and the keywords to support them.\n\nLet’s stick with the example of a buyer looking for a CRM. In the consideration stage, they will know what their options are, and they might be overwhelmed. They are looking for support and want help weighing up solutions.\n\nConversion\n\nThe buyer is ready to make a decision and take action. They’ve narrowed down their options and are looking for reassurance, offers, or reasons to choose your product or service.\n\nThis stage of the buyer journey needs to reassure the buyer’s confidence in your solution and make conversion easy and tempting.\n\nKeywords for this buyer journey will be targeted, intent-driven keywords like “buy,” “get a quote,” “pricing,” or “[product/service] near me.” These align with transactional searches and indicate the buyer is close to making a purchase.\n\nHere’s an example of a buyer in the conversion stage.\n\nIf looking for a CRM, the buyer is ready to click “Start Free Trial.”\n\nThe key things to understand are:\n\nEvery buyer goes through a series of stages before they buy.\n\nNot every buyer starts at the awareness phase.\n\nThe three stages above could be considered broad stages, and each has its own nuance, varying by industry, business, customer, and more. You need to understand your buyer’s journey before you can serve them.\n\nAt each stage, buyers have different needs.\n\nHow to Do Keyword Research for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey\n\nNow you understand the context of the buyer journey, each phase, and some ideas of keywords, I’ll walk you through a step-by-step process of how I do keyword research for each stage of the buyer’s journey.\n\nWhen doing keyword research, it’s tempting to start from the top with the awareness stage, but I reverse this process and start at the bottom buyer journey stage, conversion. I start with conversion for two main reasons:\n\nConversion-driven keywords are the most important. Starting with conversion keywords keeps me focused. You can quickly become overwhelmed by the content opportunities starting ToFu.\n\nStick with me as I share the complete guide.\n\nStep 1: Prepare a Google document.\n\nI love to record my buyer journey keyword strategy on Google Sheets. For now, you don’t need to do anything fancy.\n\nSimply set up a document and save it somewhere safe. You will use this document to import all your keyword research.\n\nKeyword Research Template Build your SEO strategy with this free template.

Click this link to access this resource at any time. Download Now\n\nStep 2: Identify your bottom-funnel keyword.\n\nThere are many ways to gather bottom-funnel keywords. If you have a strong and well-managed ads account, start there.\n\nUse Google Ads to identify buyer journey keywords for bottom-funnel keywords.\n\nTo find keywords that convert, follow these steps:\n\nSign in to Google Ads. Click “Insights and Reports,” then “Search Terms.” Filter the table by the highest conversions.\n\nThe screenshot above shows a redacted Ads account for one of my clients. It shows the steps you take to find the keywords.\n\nI want to note that not all keywords in the ads account work. The highest-converting keyword is excluded because although it received conversions, it didn’t get sales. The ads manager excluded this keyword, so SEO should likely exclude it, too.\n\nTop tip: Many of the highest-converting keywords will include your brand name. You will be ranking for these anyway, so don’t focus on them. Choose keywords that you need to work on to increase rankings.\n\nResearch buyer journey keywords using SEO tools.\n\nSEO tools such as Semrush offer insights into keywords, volumes, and intent. There are many on the market, but my favorite is Semrush, so I’ll demonstrate this stage using Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nOn your chosen keyword research tool, add your head keyword. Your head keyword will be the product or service you are selling.\n\nFor this example, I’ve chosen “CRM.” Many keyword research tools allow you to filter results, including “transactional” keywords, which are likely to convert.\n\nYou need to:\n\nIdentify your head keyword. Search it in your keyword tool. Filter results by “transactional” intent keywords. Manually review keywords, choosing the keywords that work for your business.\n\nTop tip: Don’t worry too much about search volume and keyword difficulty. Generally, conversion keywords are the most difficult to rank for and often have lower search volumes. Remember the funnel from earlier? The smallest section is at the bottom, as users at this point in the buyer journey reduce.\n\nResearch buyer journey keywords using Google Search Console and G4.\n\nGoogle Search Console is not the easiest way of identifying buyer journey keywords, but it is free, so I’ve included it.\n\nTo determine whether a keyword is helping you make sales, you need to understand how users engage with the pages the keyword drives traffic to.\n\nFirst, let’s find pages that convert.\n\nLog in to G4. Navigate to Reports Navigate to Life Cycle > Engagement> Landing Page Report Filter by revenue\n\nTake your highest-performing pages and analyze the URL in Google Search Console (GSC).\n\nLog in to Google Search Console. Go to Search Results. Click “Add Filter.” Add a page. Add the URL.\n\nGSC will filter all keywords generating clicks for the page input. Review the keywords and identify if keywords are likely to result in a sale.\n\nTop tip: Google Search Console won’t tell you which keywords are converting, so you’ll need to use some common sense.\n\nStep 3: Conduct keyword research for middle funnel (consideration) buyer journey keywords.\n\nFrom the stage above, you should have a list of keywords that you’d love to rank for. These are your bottom-funnel or conversion keywords.\n\nGenerally, these keywords are used on:\n\nProduct pages\n\nService pages\n\nConversion-driven landing pages\n\nLater, I’ll discuss keyword mapping so you know exactly where to place your keywords.\n\nBefore creating more content, though, I like to ensure I have the content available to support bottom-funnel pages in a way that builds E-E-A-T. I like to start with the next most important item, which is content that fits the middle-funnel buyer's journey: Consideration.\n\nThe type of content we can use for keyword research includes:\n\nCase studies.\n\nReviews.\n\nSome articles.\n\nYou likely already have these pages on your website. I might take these pages and put them into Google Search Console to see if I can find any relevant keywords. To do this, use the steps above for keyword research and filter by page.\n\nImportant note: Your review keywords are really important and often missed by brands. I see too many websites that lack a review page and therefore give clicks away to review sites or even social media. You want a page on your website that showcases your reviews and manages your brand narrative.\n\nTop tip: If you don’t find much in terms of keywords and search volume, don’t worry too much. Not every piece of content for the buyer journey has to be for SEO. Some content can be shared with other marketing departments via email, for example.\n\nStep 4: Conduct keyword research for top funnel (awareness) buyer journey keywords.\n\nFinally, I identify keywords for the awareness buyer journey stage.\n\nVisualize the funnel from earlier. The funnel shape provides a visual for the traffic volumes at each stage of the buyer journey. Awareness is at the largest point of the funnel because it has the most searches, keywords, and users. As you get further down the funnel, it narrows because the audience gets smaller.\n\nTo do keyword research for this phase, I go back to Semrush, following the steps above, and navigate to the Keyword Magic Tool. I remove filters for the intent and look at Questions as well as keywords to see which keywords inspire content.\n\nImportant note: The tools do a fantastic job of providing keyword inspiration, but there is no replacement for talking to customers and your peers. Ask sales what types of questions people ask. Find out exactly who your target audience is and what they need from you. It’s very easy to get distracted at this stage. You must create content that your audience needs.\n\nCreating the right content and targeting the keywords your audience needs has never been more important. With the rise of AI, top-funnel keywords get far fewer clicks as AI overviews serve the buyer. You need every click to count.\n\nKeyword Research Template Build your SEO strategy with this free template.

Bottom-funnel keywords are generally pretty self-explanatory. “Demo CRM,” for example, clearly needs to go to a page where a CRM can be demoed.\n\nMany keywords won’t be as self-explanatory, though.\n\nI like to use Google in private browsing, so the search engine results pages (SERPs) are not tailored to my usual search history.\n\nLet’s Google “best CRM for sales and marketing teams,” and I’ll show you how I analyze the SERPs.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking when I look at these SERPs:\n\nWhich pages are ranking? Looking at the organic listings, all pages, bar the top result, are product pages with “demo” or “free” in the URL and or title tag.\n\nLooking at the organic listings, all pages, bar the top result, are product pages with “demo” or “free” in the URL and or title tag. Which SERP features are available? I can see People Also Ask, videos, and review snippets.\n\nI can see People Also Ask, videos, and review snippets. Priority is given to the Zapier round-up article and videos.\n\nFrom this information, you can gather:\n\nThe type of page you need to rank (a product page).\n\nComponents to include on the page (video, questions, aggregateRatings schema).\n\nVideos are a high priority and should be added.\n\nWhat you’re doing here is using Google’s “understanding” of the searcher’s needs to determine what they want and what you’ll create to meet it.\n\nGoogle has a complex algorithm dedicated to providing helpful content to its users. Google’s success in being helpful and providing quality information is paramount to its success as a search engine. It’s fairly safe to assume Google has search intent right.\n\nMimic the content Google is prioritizing (but do it in your own way), and you’ll likely meet user needs.\n\nStep 6: Map keywords to pages.\n\nAs an extension of the step above, correctly map buyer journey keywords to the right content. This is called keyword mapping. You assign keywords to the page that have the highest possible chance of ranking.\n\nOnce you’ve done the first step, you need to correctly identify your supporting keywords.\n\nA good example to illustrate this point is People Also Ask. I often see websites that see each FAQ as its own page or article, but this isn’t always the most efficient way to map keywords.\n\nFor the search “road bike for women,” People Also Ask provides the following questions:\n\nWhat is the best road bike for ladies?\n\nWhat size road bike do I need for a woman?\n\nWhich bike is best for females?\n\nAre road bikes good for weight loss?\n\nIt would be a mistake to use the keywords “What is the best road bike for ladies?” and “Which bike is best for females?” as keywords for the same article.\n\nYou can see this in your SERP analysis. When Googled, you can see the ranking articles.\n\nThere is one commonality, but the rest of the articles are different. The keyword “What is the best road bike for ladies?” is more nuanced, bringing up results that mention “road,” whereas the other keyword is more general.\n\nImportant note: Although this search is an excellent guide, sometimes you need to use common sense and do what is right by your values and business. For example, if you only sell road bikes, you might choose to cluster those keywords together.\n\nI like to record my buyer journey keyword map in Google Sheets. Here’s what my sheet looks like:\n\nI record a draft title, the page's focus keyword, and supporting keywords. This way, when I write the content, I know where the keywords are mapped.\n\nIf you want more support with SEO content writing, HubSpot's SEO Marketing Software allows you to optimize your content within one easy-to-use-tool.\n\nTips for Doing Keyword Research Aligned With the Buyer's Journey\n\nFinally, here are some final tips to help you feel confident about keyword research aligned with the buyer journey.\n\nAsk customers what they searched to find you.\n\nThis tip is easy to implement, especially in B2B, because the person on the other end of the phone likely understands. If you work in marketing, there’s a good chance the buyer will also respect your diligence.\n\nOnce you've built a good rapport with the prospect, ask them what they searched for to find you.\n\nThis information will give you exactly the type of keyword your buyers are searching for.\n\nStart with buyer needs.\n\nIf you follow my process for buyer journey keyword research detailed above, you’ll do this, but I can’t stress enough the importance of starting with buyer needs. It’s very tempting to go to the tools and start finding keywords, but you really want to hone in on conversions and scale back from there, discovering impactful keywords that actually help your buyer.\n\nTalk to sales and customer service representatives.\n\nNo one knows your customers like sales and customer service. Ask them which questions buyers ask frequently and what you can do in content to address common apprehensions and build trust.\n\nRemember to repurpose content.\n\nAlthough keywords and SEO are incredibly important, it takes time to rank in the top spots of Google. In the meantime, get content out to your users through other means: ads, emails, social media, etc.\n\nRefer to Google Search Console regularly.\n\nGoogle Search Console (GSC) data updates frequently. Keep a close eye on keywords you search, clicks, and impressions. Look for new opportunities to add more keywords to your content.\n\nI like to look at high impressions and low clicks to spot keywords people are searching for.\n\nFeeling conflicted about SERPs? Do the integral thing.\n\nSometimes, you’ll encounter a keyword map or SERP analysis that doesn’t quite feel right. You should always do what’s right for your buyer and business.\n\nI always say that you should do the integral thing first. You might be surprised at what you can rank, even if the SERPs aren’t quite in line with what you want to create. You can always come back and compromise later.\n\nBuyer Journey Keyword Strategy Helps You Qualify Content’s Role\n\nSEO is notorious for being tricky in tracking its contribution to sales. It’s not like ads where you have keywords with sales assigned. Instead, you can only really assign click quantities.\n\nHowever, there is a major benefit to buyer journey keywords: you know that not everything is created to convert. Some keywords are used on pages that convert, and others are there to build awareness. This means you can alter your tracking accordingly.\n\nFor ToFu pieces, track clicks, impressions, newsletter signups, and return visitors.\n\nUse segment gap analysis to establish content (and therefore keywords) that contribute to the buyer journey and sales. You can create two segments: purchasers and users who viewed an article and bought it after X time. This helps show the role of content and keywords on the buyer journey..\n\nTrack sales from bottom-funnel pages gaining clicks from bottom-funnel keywords.\n\nMonitor pages that are generating revenue and ranking only for non-brand keywords.\n\nUse ad data to determine SEO’s impact. If something converts in ads, then it likely converts organically, too.\n\nTurn Your SEO Strategy Into a Revenue-Generating Machine With Buyer Journey Keywords\n\nSince using buyer journey keywords and building a strategy from the bottom-funnel keyword, I’ve felt much happier with my SEO.\n\nUpward trending graphs are still deeply fulfilling and exciting, but the benefit of generating revenue (and being able to prove it) is far superior."}

Ultimate without buying a new one.\n\nThe bad news is you won't get the full functionality.\n\nAs spotted by Matt Swider, who runs the deals blog The Shortcut, old Pro controllers will have full functionality with games but won't be fully compatible with consoles.

Needless to say, that's.... very annoying.\n\nGetting your butt up off the couch to press an on/off button in this day and age? Might as well trade in your car for a horse and start greeting your friends as \"kind sir.\"\n\nThis bad news means, if waking your console with a button is a priority for you, you'll have to buy an entirely new Switch 2-specific Pro controller for $85.\n\nThat's not ideal, considering the console itself is $450 and games are now $80 to $90, but you do at least get some perks for being forced into new hardware.\n\nSwitch 2 Pro controller perks\n\nThe Switch 2 Pro controller might not be a huge departure from the previous generation, but it does have a couple perks that could make it worth your while.\n\nOne of them is Hall Effect joysticks, which differ from regular joysticks since they don't actually make contact with the controller's internal hardware.\n\nInstead, they use magnets that create a degree of separation on the inside which vastly reduces the wear and tear and should greatly increase your controller's longevity.\n\nAs someone who abuses controllers playing Super Smash Bros. I personally wouldn't mind a more durable piece of hardware, even if it means spending another $80.\n\nOn top of Hall Effect joysticks, the new Pro controllers also have faster charging so that means less time waiting around for controller to gather steam when you inevitably forget to charge in between uses.\n\n(Image credit: Photo by Stevie Bonifield for Laptop Mag)\n\nI don't mean to spin the annoyance in a positive light. Nintendo is definitely turning up the heat on its fans in pretty much all regards.\n\nGames are more expensive, hardware is more expensive, accessories are (slightly) more expensive. And that's not even factoring in tariffs, really.\n\nUnfortunately, this seems to be the way things are going, however, and I guess if we're going to be forced into buying new hardware the best silver lining I can find is Hall Effect joysticks."}

To this day it’s quite literally the financial bedrock for banks, businesses and financial institutions, running largely unnoticed by the world on mainframes and similar high-reliability computer systems. That said, as a domain-specific language targeting boring business things it doesn’t quite get the attention or hype as general purpose programming or scripting languages. Its main characteristic in the public eye appears be that it’s ‘boring’.\n\nDespite this, COBOL is a very effective language for writing data transactions, report generating and related tasks. Due to its narrow focus on business applications, it gets one started with very little fuss, is highly self-documenting, while providing native support for decimal calculations, and a range of I/O access and database types, even with mere files. Since version 2002 COBOL underwent a number of modernizations, such as free-form code, object-oriented programming and more.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s fetch an open-source COBOL toolchain and run it through its paces with a light COBOL tutorial.\n\nSpoiled For Choice\n\nIt used to be that if you wanted to tinker with COBOL, you pretty much had to either have a mainframe system with OS/360 or similar kicking around, or, starting in 1999, hurl yourself at setting up a mainframe system using the Hercules mainframe emulator. Things got a lot more hobbyist & student friendly in 2002 with the release of GnuCOBOL, formerly OpenCOBOL, which translates COBOL into C code before compiling it into a binary.\n\nWhile serviceable, GnuCOBOL is not a compiler, and does not claim any level of standard adherence despite scoring quite high against the NIST test suite. Fortunately, The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) just got updated with a brand-new COBOL frontend (gcobol) in the 15.1 release. The only negative is that for now it is Linux-only, but if your distribution of choice already has it in the repository, you can fetch it there easily. Same for Windows folk who have WSL set up, or who can use GnuCOBOL with MSYS2.\n\nWith either compiler installed, you are now ready to start writing COBOL. The best part of this is that we can completely skip talking about the Job Control Language (JCL), which is an eldritch horror that one would normally be exposed to on IBM OS/360 systems and kin. Instead we can just use GCC (or GnuCOBOL) any way we like, including calling it directly on the CLI, via a Makefile or integrated in an IDE if that’s your thing.\n\nHello COBOL\n\nAs is typical, we start with the ‘Hello World’ example as a first look at a COBOL application:\n\nIDENTIFICATION DIVISION . PROGRAM-ID . hello-world . PROCEDURE DIVISION . DISPLAY \"Hello, world!\". STOP RUN.\n\nAssuming we put this in a file called hello_world.cob , this can then be compiled with e.g. GnuCOBOL: cobc -x -free hello_world.cob .\n\nThe -x indicates that an executable binary is to be generated, and -free that the provided source uses free format code, meaning that we aren’t bound to specific column use or sequence numbers. We’re also free to use lowercase for all the verbs, but having it as uppercase can be easier to read.\n\nFrom this small example we can see the most important elements, starting with the identification division with the program ID and optionally elements like the author name, etc. The program code is found in the procedure division , which here contains a single display verb that outputs the example string. Of note is the use of the period (.) as a statement terminator.\n\nAt the end of the application we indicate this with stop run. , which terminates the application, even if called from a sub program.\n\nHello Data\n\nAs fun as a ‘hello world’ example is, it doesn’t give a lot of details about COBOL, other than that it’s quite succinct and uses plain English words rather than symbols. Things get more interesting when we start looking at the aspects which define this domain specific language, and which make it so relevant today.\n\nFew languages support decimal (fixed point) calculations, for example. In this COBOL Basics project I captured a number of examples of this and related features. The main change is the addition of the data division following the identification division:\n\nDATA DIVISION. WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 01 A PIC 99V99 VALUE 10.11. 01 B PIC 99V99 VALUE 20.22. 01 C PIC 99V99 VALUE 00.00. 01 D PIC $ZZZZV99 VALUE 00.00. 01 ST PIC $*(5).99 VALUE 00.00. 01 CMP PIC S9(5)V99 USAGE COMP VALUE 04199.04. 01 NOW PIC 99/99/9(4) VALUE 04102034.\n\nThe data division is unsurprisingly where you define the data used by the program. All variables used are defined within this division, contained within the working-storage section . While seemingly overwhelming, it’s fairly easily explained, starting with the two digits in front of each variable name. This is the data level and is how COBOL structures data, with 01 being the highest (root) level, with up to 49 levels available to create hierarchical data.\n\nThis is followed by the variable name, up to 30 characters, and then the PICTURE (or PIC ) clause. This specifies the type and size of an elementary data item. If we wish to define a decimal value, we can do so as two numeric characters (represented by 9 ) followed by an implied decimal point V , with two decimal numbers ( 99 ). As shorthand we can use e.g. S9(5) to indicate a signed value with 5 numeric characters. There a few more special characters, such as an asterisk which replaces leading zeroes and Z for zero suppressing.\n\nThe value clause does what it says on the tin: it assigns the value defined following it to the variable. There is however a gotcha here, as can be seen with the NOW variable that gets a value assigned, but due to the PIC format is turned into a formatted date ( 04/10/2034 ).\n\nWithin the procedure division these variables are subjected to addition ( ADD A TO B GIVING C. ), subtraction with rounding ( SUBTRACT A FROM B GIVING C ROUNDED. ), multiplication ( MULTIPLY A BY CMP .) and division ( DIVIDE CMP BY 20 GIVING ST. ).\n\nFinally, there are a few different internal formats, as defined by USAGE : these are computational (COMP) and display (the default). Here COMP stores the data as binary, with a variable number of bytes occupied, somewhat similar to char , short and int types in C. These internal formats are mostly useful to save space and to speed up calculations.\n\nHello Business\n\nIn a previous article I went over the reasons why a domain specific language like COBOL cannot be realistically replaced by a general language. In that same article I discussed the Hello Business project that I had written in COBOL as a way to gain some familiarity with the language. That particular project should be somewhat easy to follow with the information provided so far. New are mostly file I/O, loops, the use of perform and of course the Report Writer, which is probably best understood by reading the IBM Report Writer Programmer’s Manual (PDF).\n\nGoing over the entire code line by line would take a whole article by itself, so I will leave it as an exercise for the reader unless there is somehow a strong demand by our esteemed readers for additional COBOL tutorial articles.\n\nSuffice it to say that there is a lot more functionality in COBOL beyond these basics. The IBM ILE COBOL reference (PDF), the IBM Mainframer COBOL tutorial, the Wikipedia entry and others give a pretty good overview of many of these features, which includes object-oriented COBOL, database access, heap allocation, interaction with other languages and so on."}

And if you own a laptop or a handheld PC with an Intel Core Ultra 200V (Lunar Lake) chip inside, you’re getting one.\n\nIntel said Tuesday that the company’s latest graphics driver (32.0.101.6734) is offering a power-management update that has the effect of boosting GPU performance by about 10 percent in terms of higher frame rate. You’ll see it first in handhelds, specifically the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and MSI Claw 7 AI+, but it will be rolled out to other Lunar Lake / Core Ultra 200V systems soon, Intel said.\n\nEssentially, the driver allows higher performance at the default power level of 17W, Intel said. There are two improvements: the higher frame rate, and a 25 percent improvement on what’s known as the “99th percentile” frame rate. The latter term is also sometimes referred to as “the lows” or “1 percent lows,” and refers to rare moments when the frame rate drops suddenly. These rare moments still manifest themselves as a jitter or hitch, and can disrupt timing-driven games — and they just look bad. Essentially, this new graphics update will make games run faster, as well as smoother.\n\nAnd what games? Intel provided a sample, below:\n\nIntel\n\nIntel has invested heavily in software driver development to avoid the issues that plagued the first-gen Intel “Alchemist” GPUs,” Intel fellow Tom Petersen told PCWorld’s The Full Nerd podcast in December. And Intel’s second-gen Arc B580 “Battlemage” GPU was essentially a tariff-buster, before there were tariffs.\n\nSince the Lunar Lake chips include the Xe2 GPU that later ended up in Battlemage, it seems reasonable that Intel’s driver update could enable these gains. Will we see something similar inside the B580 cards, too?"}

There are already a bunch of other clients, but I wanted to try the latest Go features and linters on a new project. I’m glad I did; it was a lot of fun.\n\nThe client can retrieve active items, lists of items, etc. (comments and stories are called “items” in the HN API). Although I only really needed recent items for my project, for completeness I added “scan” which downloads all the items, in order, from zero to the latest or the other way around.\n\nI wondered — could I just download the whole thing? Extrapolating from a few thousand items, it would only be tens of GiB of JSON. I thought I’d give it a try.\n\nhn scan --no-cache --asc -c- -o full.json\n\nI had to CTRL-C a stalled download a few times, but scan is resumable so after a few hours I was done. I had a 20 GiB JSON file of everything that has ever happened on Hacker News, and I can just re-run the command above to “top it off” any time I need the latest. But what could I do with it?\n\nPart 2: Feed The Ducks\n\nFirst I just grepped for things. How many times has the phrase “correct horse battery staple” appeared on the site? Quite a few: 231 times (the last one just today). But grepping stuff is old news, so I thought I’d try out DuckDB.\n\nIn the database world, DuckDB is unique: a super-fast embeddable analytics execution engine also available as a command-line tool. I spend most of my day wrangling a different database (there’s the plug my coworkers will be looking for) but I’ve been meaning to try DuckDB and it seemed perfect for this one-off task.\n\nAs it turns out, with their new UI for novices like me, it’s a breeze to use. AND LLMs are pretty good at helping craft the SQL queries. I just had to import the data:\n\nCREATE TABLE items AS SELECT * FROM read_json_auto ( '/home/jason/full.json' , format = 'nd' , sample_size = - 1 ) ;\n\nThen query it. Here’s a 12-week moving average of the fraction of total items containing the terms I am interested in:\n\nWITH weekly AS ( SELECT DATE_TRUNC ( 'week' , TO_TIMESTAMP ( time ) ) AS week_start , COUNT ( * ) FILTER ( WHERE text ILIKE '%python%' ) :: float / NULLIF ( COUNT ( * ) , 0 ) AS python_prop , COUNT ( * ) FILTER ( WHERE text ILIKE '%javascript%' ) :: float / NULLIF ( COUNT ( * ) , 0 ) AS javascript_prop , COUNT ( * ) FILTER ( WHERE text ILIKE '%java%' ) :: float / NULLIF ( COUNT ( * ) , 0 ) AS java_prop , COUNT ( * ) FILTER ( WHERE text ILIKE '%ruby%' ) :: float / NULLIF ( COUNT ( * ) , 0 ) AS ruby_prop , COUNT ( * ) FILTER ( WHERE text ILIKE '%rust%' ) :: float / NULLIF ( COUNT ( * ) , 0 ) AS rust_prop FROM items GROUP BY week_start ) SELECT week_start , AVG ( python_prop ) OVER ( ORDER BY week_start ROWS BETWEEN 11 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) AS avg_python_12w , AVG ( javascript_prop ) OVER ( ORDER BY week_start ROWS BETWEEN 11 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) AS avg_javascript_12w , AVG ( java_prop ) OVER ( ORDER BY week_start ROWS BETWEEN 11 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) AS avg_java_12w , AVG ( ruby_prop ) OVER ( ORDER BY week_start ROWS BETWEEN 11 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) AS avg_ruby_12w , AVG ( rust_prop ) OVER ( ORDER BY week_start ROWS BETWEEN 11 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) AS avg_rust_12w FROM weekly ORDER BY week_start ;\n\nOverall DuckDB seems really great for analyzing data sets of this size.\n\nNext Steps\n\nNow that I have a local download of all Hacker News content, I can train hundreds of LLM-based bots on it and run them as contributors, slowly and inevitably replacing all human text with the output of a chinese room oscillator perpetually echoing and recycling the past.\n\nOr alternatively, I think for this project I am done. Someone else will have to take it to the next logical step.\n\nThanks for reading! Please check out hn.unlurker.com, take a look at my other articles, or find me on X."}

Scholars, activists, and the public still argue about the Vietnam War, including over American motivations to intervene, the viability of the South Vietnamese government, and if the U.S. lost the war or gave up its objectives due to domestic pressure. In 1954, Ho Chi Minh had successfully overthrown Vietnam’s longtime French colonizer and established a communist government in Hanoi. Viewing Southeast Asia as the next horizon in the Cold War, the U.S. helped form an anti-communist government in South Vietnam. But Saigon struggled to achieve stability amid communist incursions, internal flaws, and the imperialistic association with its American ally. Subsequent U.S. military operations, obfuscated to the public by the Johnson and then the Nixon Administrations, ultimately failed to meet the objective of an independent, noncommunist South Vietnam.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRead More: A Look Back at 50 Years of TIME Coverage of the Vietnam War’s Aftermath The resulting public perception of Vietnam as “the bad war” in which the U.S. caused more harm than good has translated into indifferent, if not hostile, treatment of military veterans and Vietnamese refugees. Many chose not to reveal or discuss their experiences. And yet, their stories remind us that the Vietnam War continues to impact veterans and their families, as well as American political culture. I learned for myself as guest curator for the Virginia Museum of History and Culture’s (VMHC) exhibit “Virginia and the Vietnam War” how many today are more eager to share their experiences and personal items. When the VMHC issued a press release soliciting oral history interviews and artifacts, we received a far greater response than we could accommodate, needing to limit our oral history interviews to 26 recordings.\n\nAt the VMHC and with limited gallery space as a constraining factor, I focused on gathering small, personal objects from lenders, a curatorial decision inspired by Vietnam veteran Tim O’Brien’s novel The Things They Carried. Tucked in pockets and worn around necks, over shoulders, in holsters, and so on, these small objects told big stories about the politics, policies, and operations of the war, as well as its emotional impact. Read More: From Eisenhower to Trump: How Military Service Impacts the Presidency For example, in the “Diplomacy” section of our exhibit, a key artifact is an autograph book lent by Charles Trueheart, whose father Bill Trueheart served as the Deputy Chief of Mission in the American embassy in Saigon along with Ambassador Frederick “Fritz” Nolting from 1961 to 1963. The autograph book includes the signature of South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem. Originally praised in the U.S., the Catholic Diem and his family became polarizing figures after a series of demonstrations and Buddhist immolations protesting the administration’s repressive policies and corruption. Ambassador Nolting and many defense officials considered Diem an imperfect yet effective leader, while most in the State Department deemed Diem’s administration irredeemable. Longtime friends Trueheart and Nolting stood on opposite sides of this debate. After Diem and his brother were killed in a coup authorized by the U.S., Nolting felt betrayed. He and Trueheart never spoke again, devastating their families and foreshadowing the later polarization on the home front about how best to extend American ideals abroad.\n\nThe “In Country” portion of our exhibit focuses on those serving in Vietnam. Veteran Pat Clark lent two objects that brought him comfort: an inscribed prayer book and an engraved Zippo he used for lighting cigarettes. Donut Dollie Red Cross volunteer Susan Bradshaw McLean lent a claymore bag affixed with pins from multiple military units. Originally used to store claymore mines and their accessories, the bag had been repurposed by McLean to carry supplies to men in the field. It also included artwork from local villagers, illuminating the strong connection many Americans felt with the Vietnamese through daily interactions or in the effort to provide medical and other services. Read More: 50 Years After the War, Trump Undermines U.S.-Vietnam Reconciliation A tea towel is a highlight in the “Families on the Home Front” section. Embroidered by Phyllis Galanti to send to her captured husband Paul, who was taken as a prisoner of war in communist North Vietnam. The towel symbolizes the frustrations of navigating North Vietnamese prisoner of war policies. Calling the POWs “war criminals,” Hanoi refused the package in 1967, so Phyllis sent it again in 1968. POWs received little mail, and suffered severe deprivation and torture, making objects from home all the more valuable. This time, Paul received the towel, and carried it in prison until it was confiscated in a search. It was returned at his release in 1973.\n\nThe “Activism” section reflects the evolution of the anti-war movement. In addition to mainstream activists like Ben Ragsdale, who emphasized nonviolent demonstrations and collaborated with Martin Luther King, Jr., the exhibit also includes a Youth International Party, or “Yippie!” flag carried by an anti-war protester. Affixed with a marijuana plant over a communist star, the flag demonstrates the melding of cultural and political radicalism in some activist quarters and sheds light on why many Americans opposed the anti-war movement than the war itself. Whether peace activists shortened or prolonged the war became a point of contention on the home front, a debate reflected in increased political polarization between leftists associated with the Democrats and the “silent majority” associated with Republicans. U.S. ground troops left Vietnam in 1973 with the signing of the Paris Peace Accords. Our exhibit section on the “Fall of Saigon, Rise of Little Saigons” gives insight into life under one independent communist government after the capture of Saigon on April 30, 1975. This section features a red child’s shirt packed by Joe Tiet, a former Army of Republic of Vietnam soldier (the military of the former US-allied government of South Vietnam), who was sentenced to a re-education camp before escaping Vietnam in 1978. Meant to punish those connected to the old regime and to convert them to the new communist one, these forced labor camps ensnared hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese and contributed to a refugee crisis. The shirt symbolizes Tiet’s hopes for his family and belief in the American promise when they relocated to Virginia.\n\nRead More: The U.S. Offered My Family a Home After the Vietnam War. It Must Do the Same for Those Fleeing Afghanistan VMHC also hosted a panel titled, “Remembering the War” which reminded us about the contentious legacy of Vietnam and how many veterans found it difficult to process their experiences amidst a home front that just wanted to move on. The exhibit features a Vietnam Veterans of America hat lent by Michael Lund. An Army war correspondent in Vietnam (1970-71), Lund hid his service for 30 years but when the U.S. went to war with Afghanistan and Iraq, he wanted to lend a constructive voice. An English professor and published author, Lund founded “Home and Abroad,” a free program that offers workshops and consultations to veterans, active duty military, and families wanting to write their stories. One participant, Thomas Bragg, discovered how to talk about his friendship with Eddie Lama, who was killed in action. Lund’s hat symbolizes his coming out as a Vietnam veteran and connection to the veterans’ community.\n\nThe Vietnam War prompted debate on whether or not American ideals could be extended abroad, and if so, through what methods. Losing the war didn’t decide those debates, rather it made Americans suspicious of the U.S. foreign policy regime, more wary of inserting U.S. authority into complicated overseas conflicts, and increasingly sensitive to the human costs of war.\n\nSimilar debates have taken place over U.S. military policy in the Middle East and Ukraine. However, the Republican Party’s divide between neoconservative and isolationist wings do not yet indicate a clear political realignment. The Vietnam War also impacted U.S. demographics. Before the war, only 15,000 people of Vietnamese descent lived in the entire U.S.; now more than 60,000 live in Virginia alone. And these refuges have made important contributions to our society, pursuing military service, political office, and political and cultural activism.\n\nThe messy reality of Vietnam reminds us of the continued relevance of the Vietnam War. It proved a defining moment not only in the lives of soldiers, family members, activists, and refugees, but for U.S. political culture in debates over foreign policy efforts, democracy, dissent, and national healing.\n\nEmilie Raymond is a professor of history at Virginia Commonwealth University.

Since then, Siri has received a visual refresh with its new rainbow animation, text-to-Siri support, visual intelligence, and image generation. Features like Genmoji are also available in iOS 18. However, the most critical aspects of Siri, like being conversational and having contextual awareness, are still missing. Meanwhile, AI assistants like ChatGPT and Perplexity are leaps and bounds ahead of Siri in many ways. So, I wanted to put all three to the test to see who deserves to be your go-to voice assistant on the iPhone today. Here is what I found.\n\nI highly recommend watching the video below to see all three in action. It will give you a better sense of accuracy and response speed for each assistant.\n\nThe setup\n\nFor this test, I used the free versions of all three assistants. I wanted to make it so anyone could try these out at any time and see how good they are out of the box.\n\nI also had a few hunches going in:\n\nSiri might surprise us when it comes to app integrations.\n\nmight surprise us when it comes to app integrations. Perplexity could be a quiet contender with real-time info and partial app support.\n\ncould be a quiet contender with real-time info and partial app support. ChatGPT would probably be the smartest, but wouldn’t be able actually to do much on my iPhone.\n\nLeave your hunches in the comments below. Now let’s get started.\n\nBasic knowledge\n\nThis is the easiest one for all three. I asked simple questions like:\n\nWho is the president of France?\n\nCan you convert Fahrenheit to Celsius?\n\nCan you define this?\n\nAll three handled it very easily. Siri responded with a visual text prompt on screen while the other two responded vocally. I did notice that Perplexity’s assistant spoke much slower than GPT, but regardless, they all nailed it. One thing to note is that I did not ask follow-up questions here.\n\nWinner: Tied\n\nNavigation and local search\n\nHere is where things get a bit more interesting. I asked each of these to find me a pet-friendly pizzeria near me, and then I asked it to navigate me there. So this was a double question prompt that also had to take action for me.\n\nChatGPT gave me a list of places that fit my criteria, but because there is zero app integration, it could not send me to the maps app to navigate.\n\nPerplexity found the same spots and then showed me a routed map in the Perplexity app. Then, it gives you a single-tap option to go to the Apple Maps app, so it got me just one step away from navigating there.\n\nSiri handled it best because it is built by Apple and has proper integration in apps. It found a few spots and then opened up Apple Maps to give me turn-by-turn directions.\n\nWinner: Siri\n\nCurrent event article summarization\n\nNow we are getting into it. I asked each assistant to pull up the latest 9to5mac article and then summarize it for me. Here is how each faired:\n\nSiri failed miserably. It pulled up a list of 9to5mac articles via the news App, and that’s it. It could not summarize anything for me\n\nChatGPT found the correct article I was looking for and gave a brief vocal summary, which was nice.\n\nPerplexity found the article and also summarized it, but what I liked is that it asked for confirmation that that was the article I was looking for. I appreciated that.\n\nWinner: Perplexity\n\nReal-world problem solving\n\nI recently used ChatGPT’s live video feed to help me figure out how to turn on a pool heater pump. I was in awe. I opened up the voice assistant, pointed the camera at the pump, and it knew exactly what to do and how to do it. So I wanted to see how these assistants would fare by asking them to help me with a flat tire. Weirdly enough, only GPT gave me a detailed, step-by-step answer. Perplexity stalled after one or two prompts. Siri didn’t hold up at all.\n\nWinner: ChatGPT\n\nTravel and time logic\n\nHere I got a bit weird with it. I wanted to ask them a question that in theory should be easy, but something most people wouldn’t ask. I said, “If I left NYC at 5PM and drove 6 hours, what cities could I reach?”.\n\nAll three assistants gave me some decent answers. They all listed cities that were 4-6 hours away from NYC.\n\nPerplexity was the only one that was actually able to pull up a map and show me the options. Then also get me one step away from opening Apple Maps and navigating there.\n\nWinner: Perplexity\n\nApp integration and utilities\n\nThis is where GPT gets overtaken big time and also where Siri flexes its muscles. Perplexity is this weird middle ground because it does have some integrations into iOS, but can’t do much with it.\n\nSiri is the only assistant that can open both first- and third-party apps. It can send iMessages, open third-party apps like Spotify, and trigger reminders natively. This is where Siri surprised me a bit. If you have straightforward actions and you know what you need to get done, Siri can accomplish it. But you cannot get too complicated, otherwise it just times out.\n\nPerplexity can draft an email, play music via Apple Music, and open podcasts, but requires confirmation taps. Also, perplexity can only work with 1st party iOS apps. When you ask it to do something with a non-Apple app, it just won’t.\n\nChatGPT has zero integrations with any apps, so it got disqualified.\n\nWinner: Siri\n\nFinal verdict: Who should you use?\n\nThis depends on how you define an AI assistant. If that means to take action for you via voice, then there is no real contest other than Siri. Siri is the only assistant that can do anything at all in iOS. But if an AI assistant to you is a real-world helper that can help with fact-based questions and have true conversational dialogue, then Chat GPT is the way to go. I have GPT mapped to my action button. If Siri and GPT could somehow integrate, then that is the best of both worlds; maybe that will come with iOS 19. But for now, I will continue to use GPT as a Siri replacement.\n\nAs I said, I recommend watching our video to see this all unfold in real time. But let me know what you think. Do you use AI assistants? Do you use Siri? I plan on trying out other AI assistants to compare to Siri, so let me know which comparison you want to see next!"}

I founded Perfect Wiki — a SaaS product for creating internal company knowledge bases that works directly within Microsoft Teams. We created a simple and convenient tool for storing, editing, and sharing knowledge within companies. It all started with the idea to resolve one specific pain point: the built-in Wiki in Microsoft Teams offered was inconvenient, and there was no worthy alternatives with full integration to the platform.\n\nIn this article, I want to share how the idea came about, the mistakes I made, how I found my first customers, and how I gradually grew to a steady income of $250,000 a year over five years. All of this — without investors, a 20-person team, or a “Series A” round.\n\nHow It All Began\n\nIn May 2020, I lost my job and started thinking about new projects to launch or where to direct my efforts. The pandemic drastically changed the market: the mass transition to remote work boosted interest in online communication tools, and everyone wanted to launch their own video conferencing service. It felt like a gold rush, and I decided to follow the principle: in such times, those who sell shovels win, not those who search for gold.\n\nZoom became hugely popular during the pandemic. I decided to try making a small app — a translator — and published it on the Zoom Marketplace. But it turned out people were only interested in the Zoom app itself, and the marketplace had almost no traffic.\n\nAfter that failure, I moved on to Plan B: I tried publishing the translator app on the Microsoft Teams Marketplace. It seemed like there were significantly more users, apps there had lots of ratings and installs. The platform felt “alive.” My intuition didn’t fail me — just a few days after publishing, someone bought a paid subscription. But I soon realized the translator app was very limited with no room for growth. Microsoft could easily replace it anytime.\n\nThat’s when I decided to dive deeper into analyzing what other problems Microsoft Teams users were facing and what kind of service I could offer them. I was confident I’d find a niche because the traffic and activity on the marketplace were high — a ready-made customer base was just in front of me. I just needed to find a product idea that would solve a real problem.\n\nI started reading forums, comments, and online discussions. It turned out the built-in Wiki in Microsoft Teams annoyed users really a lot. It was slow and inconvenient. That’s how the idea came about — I had to create a fast, user-friendly knowledge base built directly into Microsoft Teams. The main goal was to make it simple and intuitive for people who weren’t tech-savvy — just regular PC users.\n\nI Got My First Paying Customer Just a Few Days After Launch\n\nI created and published the first version of the product in a fairly short time — it took me about three weeks. It already had page creation and editing features, and most importantly, full-text search (a much-requested feature the users lacked in the built-in Wiki).\n\nI used technologies and tools I was already very well familiar with: Node.js + Express for the backend and React for the frontend.\n\nJust a couple of days after publishing Perfect Wiki on the Microsoft Teams Marketplace, I got my first paying user. My assumptions were confirmed — people were actively looking for an alternative to the built-in Wiki, and they searched for it directly in the Teams marketplace. They found my app using the keyword “wiki.” It was an awesome free acquisition channel. Perfect Wiki was always the top search result because there were no competitors. That’s when I realized I had found a real pain point — and I could make money by solving it.\n\nPerfect Wiki Is Now Used by Over 500 Companies\n\nToday, over 500 companies around the world use Perfect Wiki. Our main markets are the US, Canada, the UK, and Germany.\n\nOver five years, the product has grown significantly. Revenue is now about $250,000 a year. However, it wasn’t always smooth sailing — there were months with no growth, times when everything felt stuck. We had to change plans, improve the product, and look for new ideas.\n\nIn 2024, Microsoft even featured us at Microsoft Build as an example of an app that’s top-rated and highly valued among Teams users and the one the really works — a big milestone for us.\n\nWhy Do People Choose Us?\n\nMany of our clients came to us after trying the Microsoft built-in Wiki. It was clunky, inconvenient, and didn’t do the job well. We focused on simplicity: the essential features only, nothing extra — and everything should function inside Microsoft Teams.\n\nIntegration with Microsoft Teams is the key. Unlike other knowledge base platforms, Perfect Wiki doesn’t require switching to a separate site or tab. It’s available right where employees already spend most of their day — in Microsoft Teams. It saves time, doesn't add any difficulties, and makes working with a knowledge base a natural part of the workflow.\n\nMicrosoft tried to address this issue via products like Viva and Loop, but they turned out to be too bulky and confusing. Competitors like Confluence or Notion just aren’t integrated into Teams in a way that’s convenient for users.\n\nPerfect Wiki was built specifically for Microsoft Teams — and that’s been our main advantage from day one.\n\nOnly Two People Work on the Project\n\nCurrently, the team behind Perfect Wiki is just two people. I handle the development and product, and my colleague manages user support. Despite having a tiny team, we manage to achieve a lot: we launch new features quickly, communicate with customers, test ideas, and maintain stable service.\n\nWe outsource some marketing and content tasks, but everything related to the product and code we do ourselves.\n\nSometimes we bring in new people if we feel it's time to grow. Right now is one of those moments: if you’re an experienced developer familiar with Node.js + Express + React — send us your CV at hello@perfectwiki.com\n\nHow We Understand What Customers Need\n\nIt all starts with communication. We have an internal app chat — people regularly send us questions, suggestions, and feedback. We also do demo calls, discuss use-case scenarios, and every quarter, we reach out to active loyal users asking for feature and improvement ideas. This helps us to deeply understand user needs.\n\nWe don’t implement features just because they seem useful. Every new functionality in Perfect Wiki must be genuinely requested and needed by users. For example, I wasn’t sure whether a “search within a page” was necessary. But after several complaints about documents getting longer, and Ctrl+F not working in Teams — it became clear the feature was needed.\n\nAnother example: users suggested a weekly digest with a list of new or updated knowledge base articles. They wanted to stay in the loop about changes.\n\nThat’s how we improve the product — not by simple guessing, but in collaboration with our users.\n\nAnd we actually use Perfect Wiki ourselves — that helps us spot areas for changes and growth. All our internal documentation, tasks, and plans are stored in Perfect Wiki. Even our public Help Center runs on our platform. This way, we test the product in real use and quickly notice what needs fixing or tweaking.\n\nEvery time I check out competitors' sites — those who also build knowledge base or customer support platforms — I notice something odd. Almost all of them use third-party tools like Intercom or Zendesk to support their own customers. That surprises me. If your product is so great — why don’t you use it yourself? For me, that’s a golden rule: your product should be so good you want to use it yourself. If not, that means something’s wrong.\n\nA Bit About Money\n\nRight now, I earn around $25,000 per month. My monthly expenses are pretty modest:\n\n$500–$1000 on Google Cloud\n\n$400–$500 on Algolia\n\n<$350 on other SaaS tools\n\n<$500 on contractors\n\nEverything else is my profit.\n\nWhat I’ve Learned Over the Years\n\nThe most important rule: don’t be afraid to build niche products for a narrow audience. It’s vital to create something that solves a specific problem really well.\n\nSecond lesson I learned: simplicity wins. The simpler and more understandable your product, the easier it is to sell and maintain. When you have a small team and limited resources, simplicity isn’t a luxury — it’s a necessity. It keeps you from drowning in features, endless requests, and tech debt.\n\nDid I Expect This?\n\nHonestly? I didn’t have big ambitions. I just wanted to earn a stable $70–80K a year — about what I earned at my previous job. Everything beyond that has been a pleasant bonus. Perfect Wiki has grown more than I ever expected. All without investments, offices, or a big team. Just because the product was in demand — and we kept making it better, step by step.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nPerfect Wiki has already become more than just an add-on to Microsoft Teams. Now it can also be used in Slack, via ChatGPT, or as a chatbot on your website. You can even create a public support portal for your customers — our Help Center is a prime example.\n\nWe’re constantly adding new integrations, improving search, and most importantly — always listening to our users. The best is still ahead!\n\nP.S. If you’re curious to follow our product journey, I have a Telegram channel and Twitter."}

Normally priced at $1,000, today you can get a refurb version of the 13-inch base model for $599 on eBay. It’s a deep, rare discount.\n\n$600 for an all-aluminum, sleek laptop like this is a dang good price, though I should point out that the core specs aren’t as good as some of the competition. 16GB of RAM is nice (it’s the minimum I would suggest for Windows 11 these days), but 256GB of storage is going to feel a little tight if you work with large files. The 10-core Snapdragon X Plus processor will make the battery last for a crazy amount of time, but it also means that this laptop won’t be able to handle many modern games. The IPS touchscreen is great, but some other laptops around in this price range can offer an OLED, at least when they’re on sale.\n\nFor more details, be sure to check out Matt Smith’s full review of this model — though note that the 4-star score was awarded to a higher-specced version, with a slightly faster processor and much more RAM and storage.\n\nLike a lot of the deals on eBay lately, this is an “eBay Refurbished” laptop, which means that it’s in “like new” condition and comes with a two-year Allstate warranty. Considering that you’re saving $400 off the retail price, I’d say that’s a pretty good trade, though Microsoft is offering this model as a refurb for $720 (with a one-year warranty) if you’d prefer a more official source.

(I’ll refrain from judging it as bad or good — I’m a writer and a graphic designer, but I can’t code my way out of a wet paper bag.) In fact, Microsoft’s CEO claims that up to 30 percent of the company’s new code is now created with artificial intelligence.\n\nSatya Nadella made this claim at LlamaCon (around the 45:00 minute mark), Meta/Facebook’s conference focusing on generative AI tools. In fact Nadella was opposite Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and controversy lightning rod, when he said as much yesterday.\n\n“Code reviews are very high,” says Nadella. “In fact the agents we have for reviewing code, that usage has increased, and so I would say maybe 20, 30 percent of the code that is inside of our repos today and in some of our projects are probably all written by software.”\n\nThat’s a pretty stunning claim, and as Tom’s Hardware points out, it seems in line with similar claim from Google CEO Sundar Pichai made last year. But I’ll highlight that this is an executive at a company that’s pushing hard on selling AI tools, talking to another executive pushing for AI tools, at an AI conference. All three of these figures are, shall we say, somewhat less than objective.\n\nMicrosoft’s Copilot AI tools, which use OpenAI’s ChatGPT as its primary tie-in, are being baked into pretty much every one of its products. Between Windows 11, the Edge browser, Office, and dedicated Copilot buttons on new laptop keyboards, it seems like an inescapable bull rush of both development and marketing. But behind the scenes, Microsoft seems less bullish on AI where the money is concerned, scaling back its leases on the data centers that power such tools."}

Stop picking up!", "fullContent": "Depending on your upbringing, a phone call might seem normal…or alarming overkill. But regardless of when or where you were born, one current universal truth exists: Companies will not call you and ask for your account information or personal information.\n\nDisguised under “confirming” your details, fraudsters use this tactic to scam you and gain unauthorized access to your account. The phone calls might sound legitimate, especially with the rapid improvement and accessibility of generative AI tools. But these days, they’re almost always sketchy.\n\nSo if your caller ID says a company is ringing you, let them roll to voicemail. (Caller ID can be spoofed, aka faked). If you accidentally pick up, tell them you’re busy and will call back later. Then use contact info you found yourself (like through your online account, a printed statement, or the company’s official website) to get in touch about the issue. Even if the message is about a fraud alert, still verify the situation on your own—fraud alert scams are very common.\n\nOf course, phone calls aren’t the only way scammers try to reach you. Scammers can still target you through text or email. Use the same playbook here, too: Don’t click any links in the messages. Instead, open a separate tab, navigate to the official website, and log in to see what’s going on.\n\nScams work because you should pay attention to fraud warnings and other unexpected messages about your accounts. The trick is to keep paying attention—but be smart about how you handle your next steps. Scams are unfortunately much more common as of late, due to increasing use of AI tools by shady cybercriminals. So in the event you receive a real notification from your bank or another company, you don’t want to accidentally ignore it."}

That’s ten times the standard, and more than double the speed of the OLED gaming monitor I’m looking at right now.\n\nBut you don’t go that fast without a few compromises. First, it’s a 24-inch, 1080p monitor, so pretty small and low-res by today’s standards — though the ideal size for esports pros who want to easily watch their entire screen at once. It’s also a TN LCD panel, one of the least-desirable options if you want accurate colors and wide viewing angles. Such is the life of a gamer who feels the need for speed, as other technologies can’t easily hit blazing 600Hz refresh rates. Other specs for the monitor include a 350-nit brightness, HDR400 certification, AMD FreeSync compatibility, and (sigh) a pair of built-in 2-watt speakers. There’s no mention of any USB ports.\n\nAcer\n\nAcer will sell the Nitro XV250 F6 in the US for $700 starting in May, coming to other markets in the third quarter for 799 euros. Acer is also announcing the Predator XB323QK V4, a 32-inch, 4K gaming monitor with a more color-accurate IPS panel. It can handle 160Hz at its top resolution, but bumping it down to 1080p mode will let it speed up to 320Hz.

Successful managers focus on the effect they have on others, not themselves. They also define a strategy and create a culture that drives employee behavior in their absence. Frei is the coauthor, along with Anne Morriss, of the book Unleashed: The Unapologetic Leader’s Guide to Empowering Everyone Around You as well as the HBR article “ Begin with Trust. ”\n\nHANNAH BATES: Welcome to HBR On Leadership, case studies and conversations with the world’s top business and management experts—hand-selected to help you unlock the best in those around you.\n\nHarvard Business School professor Frances Frei says the best measure of a leader’s effectiveness isn’t their charisma, vision, communication skills, or resilience. Actually, it’s their ability to, as the tagline of this podcast suggests, bring out the best in those around them.\n\nHelping your team grow, elevating their talents, and keeping them engaged all starts with trust. In this IdeaCast episode from 2020, Frei talks to host Alison Beard about how to build that trust and, ultimately, help your team thrive. Frei starts by breaking down the three main components of trust.\n\nALISON BEARD: So if trust is the starting point for good leadership today, how do you build it with employees?\n\nFRANCES FREI: Great question. And our big breakthrough came when we realized that building trust is a monolithic thing. It’s super hard, in fact, close to impossible, for most of us. But when we found that trust had three component parts, that was helpful, and then also found that each one of those component parts are actionable. So we can actually build more trust tomorrow than we have today by diagnosing which component part is in the way and then coming up with a custom solution for that particular part.\n\nALISON BEARD: So what are those three pieces?\n\nFRANCES FREI: The language we use is that its authenticity, logic and empathy. Which will feel a lot like those that have read Aristotle, feel a lot like logos, pathos and ethos. But what it really is that, do you sense that it’s the real me talking to you? Or do you feel like I’m only bringing part of me, or I’m delivering a message perhaps that I don’t really believe in, but I think I’m supposed to say. So is it the real me with sound and rigorous logic, and that I’m in it for you? If you question any of those three, the first thing to go is trust.\n\nALISON BEARD: So you said that there are ways to improve on all of those fronts. Let’s start first with authenticity. You know it can sometimes feel risky to show your full and total self at work. How do you get leaders to move into a more authentic mode?\n\nFRANCES FREI: What you’re thinking about with leaders, leaders have two jobs right. One is to be authentic themselves, but the other is to create the conditions for other people’s authenticity to show up. Because as a leader, my job is to enhance the performance of other people.\n\nWhat I have to do is make sure that people feel safe to be their authentic self. Regardless of the difference that I represent, I feel welcome. And then it starts getting really exciting. Because of any difference I represent, I’m celebrated and then I’m cherished because of it. each one of us can bring our authentic self, we get to make much more robust decisions and we get to include many more people.\n\nThe challenge is for anyone of us, how do we do it? So, let’s say that I’m, so I am a woman over 50 lesbian. Puts me in a couple of categories. If I was tempted not to bring my authentic self in any of those three categories, it’s a leader’s job who feels comfortable on age, sexuality, gender, to set the conditions for my authenticity to bloom. Note where your authenticity really shines. Like what triggers your most authentic version to show up? It’s really hard to be authentic when you’re reading a script for example.\n\nALISON BEARD: So let’s move onto the logic piece of it. How do you establish your credibility on that front?\n\nFRANCES FREI: So one part is, I’m not being very logical and I’m communicating that super clearly. Right. So that’s, like, my logic is suspicious. The other part is, I actually have really good logic, but I’m struggling in the communication of it. So, is it substance – the real logic, or is it style – the communication? We find that it’s far more often style than substance.\n\nThere’s two ways that we can communicate in the world. And one is using a beautiful storytelling technique where I take you on a journey, there’s dramatic twists and turns, and then you ultimately get to the point. That’s a beautiful way to communicate and it’s lethal for a logic wobbler. Instead I would say flip it. Start with the point, even if it feels a little scary, and then give the supporting evidence. If I take you on a journey and you give me all of that context and you tell me all of your credentials and everything along the way, awesome if I stay with you to the end, but you can lose me at so many of the plot points. Start with the point, even though it feels artificial and then give the supporting evidence.\n\nALISON BEARD: What do you do with the trickier problem of actually having flaws in your logic?\n\nFRANCES FREI: Yeah so, here the solution is even more straightforward. Which is, don’t talk about things that you don’t know well.\n\nALISON BEARD: Makes sense.\n\nFRANCES FREI: I’m just going to pause for a moment for laughter. But so, I like, I draw a box and I say, this is what you know. And then I draw a circle in the box and say, this is what you’re allowed to talk about. The temptation of course is that we talk about a circle that’s much larger than the box. If we only talk about that which we know well, we won’t have substance problems.\n\nALISON BEARD: What about the third leg of trust, empathy? How do I build that as a leader?\n\nFRANCES FREI: In this one I would say that in the time of crisis, I normally say all three are important because if you don’t have one of them you’re, you don’t have, you lose trust. But in a time of crisis, this is the one that is really important.\n\nAnd here’s the thing about empathy. I have to be present to the needs of others in order to express empathy. If I am at all self-distracted with myself, it’s about me and not about you. So when I’m in your presence, if I’m checking my email, or texting someone, I am not present to you. I’m multitasking between you and me. People will question my empathy immediately and trust is the thing that goes.\n\nThe reason this is so important right now is that we’re in a global pandemic. Everyone is going to be self-distracted right now. As a leader, when you’re building trust, you can either be self-distracted or present to others. You can’t do both at the same time. Put the oxygen mask on yourself as much as you need and I’m sure it’s more now than it was two months ago. But understand that when you’re putting the oxygen mask on yourself, you’re not leading and you’re not building trust. So, perhaps be in front of people less often, but be fully present when you are.\n\nALISON BEARD: Yeah. OK, so let’s focus on the next piece of effective leadership, something that you call love. Which seems pretty touchy feely for the corporate world. So how have you seen it work in practice?\n\nFRANCES FREI: Yeah. So, trust is the foundation. And then the way that we think about this is that if I want to bring out the best in one other person, we figured out how to do that. And it requires two levers. So if I wanted to bring out the best in you Alison, what I would do is I would make sure that you felt really high standards from me, because it’s hard for you to achieve your best in the absence of high standards.\n\nThat’s necessary, but not sufficient. The only way that’s going to work is if you also experience my deep devotion to your success. So if you experience my high standards and my deep devotion to your success, that’s when I can bring out the best in you and that’s what we call love.\n\nBut here’s where the pesky human nature comes in. Most of us when we’re setting really high standards for people, we shield them from our humanity. We don’t display our intense devotion to their success. And so we get, we come across as chilly, or uncaring. And then the story goes that I get some feedback that I’m cold and I’m not, it’s all about me. I get horrified, so then I rush to revealing that I’m deeply devoted and I accidentally insidiously lower the standards, as I show my devotion.\n\nAnd then I get really frustrated with the lack of performance that comes from that. And then I scramble back up into high standards, low devotion and a lot of us spend our lives going back and forth between those two states. What we call severity and fidelity. So the trick is, how do I simultaneously show high standards and deep devotion?\n\nALISON BEARD: That sounds like something that could work in a family as well as an office.\n\nFRANCES FREI: Well so here’s the great breakthrough we had. So a woman named Carol Dweck who’s a wonderful family psychologist, a Stanford professor. She wrote something that gave us a total breakthrough on this. She wrote, there are two ways to parent and one of them is the right way.\n\nSo then she goes onto say, and she wrote this, I’ll use her dated language. She goes onto say, you can either prepare the path for the boy, or prepare the boy for the path. And it was a bolt of lightning. I had been preparing every path, real and imagined so that my boys could travel them. I had been a weed wacker of a parent. So deep in fidelity, so deep in devotion that I didn’t even want them to have to do the work of mitigating any paths. And what she showed us is that, or you can prepare the boy for the path, so that he will be able to thrive in our absence.\n\nALISON BEARD: So how exactly does a manager do that in a corporate setting?\n\nMy belief in humanity is that we all really want to achieve and the greatest expression of love is for me to set the conditions for you to thrive. Someone’s not thriving if they’re just doing well enough. Like I think we all want to be better tomorrow than we are today. And it’s a leader’s job to set those conditions.\n\nALISON BEARD: So, who’s a leader that you’ve seen do this in action?\n\nFRANCES FREI: Oh, the best example of it is a man named Carlos Rodriguez-Pastor. To those who know him, and to everyone in Peru where he’s from, he’s a CRP. He believes in the possibility of people. Like he believes that the way to bring Peru from a third world country to a first world country, which he plans to do in his lifetime, is by setting the conditions for individuals to thrive.\n\nSo he cares more about the development of individuals than any CEO I have ever seen. Ranging from, I go down to Peru every year and teach, and we teach a new set of leaders every year, he sits in every one of the classes and takes notes on the people. I’ve never seen a CEO do that.\n\nHe sets super high standards for people starting with the recruiting process. If you want to get hired at, in one of the Intercorp companies, which people are, it’s a very long line to get hired there. It’s going to take a really long time. And if you try to use any informal mechanisms to do it like, oh I have a friend, can you talk to him? If he senses that you’re trying to use your connections, trying to do anything to mitigate a meritocracy, he does what he calls, he puts you in the freezer. He gives you a time out.\n\nBecause he wants everyone to realize that at Intercorp, it’s the meritocracy that rules. But he’s also deeply devoted to people. And I think he gets to set even higher standards than anyone else in the world, because he is so devoted to his people.\n\nOne famous example is that he and his top team, he decided to give them a reward for having done a very good job. And the reward was to go climb a mountain right near Mt. Everest. And so, this will reveal, his other rewards are like you get to go to school.\n\nAnd because he cares, he doesn’t care about status. He cares about meritocracy. So the top people that were most responsible for this, there were some that were wealthy by then. And so they bought business class tickets to get from Peru all the way to the mountain, which is a very long journey. The others that were the young scrappy people that they had coach tickets. And then just at the last minute, right, like the day before they were going to take off, Carlos asked who has business class tickets? Everyone else and me, will meet you there. I’m going to take them on my plane. Which is like, he just never misses a chance to show you that it’s not how much money you have, it’s not how much, like he’s devoted and he really cares about meritocracy.\n\nALISON BEARD: Yeah. So this vision for leadership that you have from the very beginning, from the time that you’re managing just one person all the way up, it seems to run a little bit counter to how people are noticed and rewarded in most organizations. You know, you’re really sort of taking a backseat to your people and elevating them and their needs above your own. Is there a tension there?\n\nFRANCES FREI: I think that there, so yes there is. Because we, we sometimes get put into positions of leadership because we were a really good individual contributor. And then we form a team and we think well they’re there to help us achieve even more. And so it’s about me, me, me with more and more people. And it’s, we find that that actually puts a pretty severe ceiling on what you can actually do which is that I’m thinking, how can I bring out the best in other people? So the second that I’m leading someone, it, how can I set the conditions for them to thrive? And I want there to be equal access to everyone thriving and I want more and more varied people to thrive. If I can do that, I will thump the team, that is, how can I get people to help me perform?\n\nALISON BEARD: So that’s a good transition from moving away from team managers to people leading larger groups and even organizations where they don’t have day to day contact with all of their people. So how does someone like that make sure that everyone feels trust and love and a sense of belonging when they are absent?\n\nFRANCES FREI: The way to think about it is that if I can guide your discretionary behavior in my absence that’s the whole game. So, you’re making ten’s, hundreds of decisions without my direct observation, even my direct knowledge. So if I can get you to make those decisions as well as if I was standing right next to you with my high standards and deep devotion and with our trust and you felt included, if I could get you to make those decisions as well as if I was right next to you, that’s the whole ballgame. Because I can’t be right next to you.\n\nThere are two levers we have to guide discretionary behavior. And that’s discretionary behavior in our absence. The first one is strategy. So usually we don’t talk about strategy in a leadership book. I think it’s essential for when people are in my absence, the strategy can help guide discretionary behavior. Go into a Walmart and watch 100 different employees confront the same situation and you will find 100 different employees do the same thing. Everyone at Walmart knows that their reason for being is on behalf of the customer so that they can make their lives more affordable.\n\nIt’s a disaster if you have 100 people confronting the same situation and there’s a 100 different solutions. So when strategy is clear that takes a whole bunch of discretionary decisions off the table. It’s surprising how many organizations the strategy isn’t clear enough in the minds of everyone in the organization.\n\nEverywhere where strategy is silent, where strategy is not enough, that’s where culture comes in. And culture is what describes to us how things are really done around here. I’m in a meeting and do I get to take up a lot of space or a little space? Strategy doesn’t tell me that. Culture does. I’m junior at an organization. Is it my obligation to bring up any problems I have or should I do it more politely through the chain of command? Strategy doesn’t tell us that, culture tells us that. So everything else for what’s the way that things are done around here, that’s the culture. Those are the only two levers that a senior person has for guiding, for leading in their absence.\n\nALISON BEARD: You’ve been involved in some massive cultural transformations starting with your own organization, HBS. Tell me what you learned through that experience.\n\nFRANCES FREI: Yeah, so I think it starts with, culture change has to happen quickly. And so this is counterintuitive to most people. But meaningful change happens quickly or it doesn’t happen at all. So if you’re on a five year journey for a cultural change, I would just suggest you stop and use those efforts to do something else.\n\nSo, meaningful change happens quickly and it’s because otherwise you’ll be sending mixed messages. Like I can change a culture when we’re saying, changing the culture is the most important thing. So you should decide when you want to do it and then do it in an all in, and don’t think oh, I’ll change this part of the culture now and that part later, doesn’t work. We have to do all of it now. That’s the first thing.\n\nThe second thing is make sure you have a really noble purpose and a really noble reason why you’re changing the culture. What’s the burning platform? If I didn’t change the culture, what would be so bad about it? And in my experience, the easiest reason to change the culture is that we are, we are not living up to the dignity and humanity of a group of people. Whether its customers, suppliers, employees, there’s some group of people who we have been systematically disadvantaging. And we’re going to fix that. That’s the easiest way to change a culture. There’s like a burning platform, but about people so that we find it close to immoral that we’ve been doing it and now it’s going to be the most important thing that we do.\n\nALISON BEARD: And so, at HBS the concern was that it wasn’t a welcoming environment for women. How did you quickly move to fix that?\n\nFRANCES FREI: Yeah so and that was, that was for students. And the burning platform that we had was that women had lower grades than men and women had lower self-reported satisfaction than men. Now, the truth is it gets talked a lot about in gender and I’ll talk about it in gender. But it was also true for international students and domestic for LGBT. There were 12 categories because we collected a lot of data. We solved it for everyone in the same year. And here’s the way to do it which is, one, make sure you have devastating data. It’s best if the devastating data has to do with people. So, what is it that is like gnawing at you? So, for us it was achievement and sentiment. Women weren’t achieving as well and they didn’t have same self-reported satisfaction.\n\nSo then we asked ourselves all right, what’s getting in the way of achievement and sentiment for women? At HBS we grade on a forced curve. Half of every grade is class participation. It wasn’t the grading difference, it wasn’t in exams. It was really in class participation. And then when we went and double clicked on that more, it was that women were getting a much slower start in class participation.\n\nSo there’s some people that would come into the HBS classroom and they’d feel so comfortable speaking from day one. So what we did is we had to unlock what makes good class participation, but we also had to set the conditions so that people could find their mojo, their super power early. So one of the things we did is introduce the field method. So the case method, been at HBS for, since it’s, practically since its beginning and it’s everything you can learn by talking about what you would do.\n\nBut there’s also quite a bit that you can do of learning by doing. And that’s what we call the field method, which is we’ll put you in small group, experiential settings. We did the field method before the case method so that people that would feel really great in small groups, if they were good at that, that confidence would spill over into the classroom. So one is that we created, we wanted more varied people to thrive. So we gave more varied ways to find your superpower.\n\nWe got much closer to meritocracy. And the benefit of that was that men and women got the same grades, the self-reported satisfaction, the gaps closed and here’s the really awesome thing. All of the gaps closed in satisfaction as an example and it got better for everyone.\n\nALISON BEARD: And then you applied some of those strategies at places like Uber and Riot Games. What did you do there and what types of outcomes did you see?\n\nFRANCES FREI: Yeah so applied the same strategies and got the same outcomes. So, at Riot Games they were facing a pretty public crisis. It was in August of 2018. And it’s like every senior team’s worst nightmare. Everybody wakes up to an article that has all of these claims of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. And you just be like, oh my gosh, where have I been working that this has occurred? It’s just a bombshell that goes off. Now, fast forward and much of what was written about in the paper by great journalists, much of what was written about, turned out not to be true. But some of what was written about was true.\n\nAnd so they had to do a complete refresh of this very culturally-driven organization. But the culture was now driving them unintentionally in the wrong direction. So what we did is looked at achievement and sentiment because that’s the way we know to do this. And we found there to be enormous demographic tendencies associated with who was thriving. And so we set out to, we collected the devastating data and we set out to address those. We also in the cases of both Uber and Riot, they had really strong, cultural values that were each delineated. Like in one case there was 14 and in the other case there were six. So very culturally driven. And these cultural values were awesome.\n\nOne of the famous ones at Uber was called toe stepping. And what it meant was that if you’re a junior person and you have a good idea and you’re being blocked by your manager, step on your manager’s toes and go to their manager. Because we want great ideas to be surfaced, and that’s what you want in a young company.\n\nOr one of them at Riot was default to trust. Well it turns out that over time, both of these had become weaponized. Toe stepping, instead of the junior person stepping on the toes going up, it was senior people stepping on the toes of going down. Default to trust, the same thing. Instead of when I’m explaining something to you and I want you to default to trust, so if I’m questioning you, default to trust so that like, understand that my questions are good and they’re well intended. Instead I’m a senior person. You bring up a question and I’m like, look default to trust dude. Just do it.\n\nSo you can see how, so the second a cultural value gets weaponized and cultural values, the more specific they are, the easier it is to get weaponized. As a cultural value gets weaponized, you got to take it out. There’s no, and no matter how much you loved it, and founders have a really hard time with this. Oh, but it was good and it was well intentioned. There’s no reversing it.\n\nSo what we did in both cases is we got the entire, we invited the entire company to come up and author the new cultural values. Which is literally, you sit down with the old cultural values, you have a pen in hand and we all edit them together and then we talk about which of the cultural values would be super sad if we lost and why? And which are doing, which do we observe are doing real harm to other people and why?\n\nAnd then through that process we edited it and came up with new cultural values and these new cultural values are, because these are two strong cultural environments, the new ones got adopted super quickly because they were authored by everyone.\n\nALISON BEARD: Frances, thanks so much for coming on the show.\n\nFRANCES FREI: Oh, I really loved it.

Regarding aesthetic cohesion, they all adhere to the company’s love of pastels and rounded edges. So if you use a Google Pixel daily, they probably won’t seem too misplaced on your particular device. However, if you value information density or customization options, Google’s widgets are far from the best options for your home screen. To prove my point, I detail some of the best Google widget alternatives I use on my phone.\n\nDo you use Google widgets on your phone? 391 votes Yes, every widget I use is made by Google. 21 % I only use the Google widgets I like. 48 % I try not to use Google widgets, opting for third-party alternatives where possible. 9 % No, every widget I use is from a third-party app or service. 12 % I don't use widgets on my phone. 9 %\n\nEvent Flow Widget\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nI must have a calendar widget on my phone that displays the day’s events and my plans weeks in advance. Legibility and clarity are imperative; I don’t want to stare at my screen for hours picking apart when I might have a free hour or day. This makes a wide range of customization options super important, and Event Flow Widget is the perfect candidate.\n\nIt’s not the flashiest widget, but one I’ve used on my devices for years. It includes extensive theming options, weather forecasts five days in advance, and various density options. I can choose how much text I want displayed based on my device’s screen size. Event Flow Widget offers two separate widget layouts: agenda and month. I use both.\n\nTasks.org\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nThe Google Tasks widget must’ve been created on a Friday afternoon. It’s functionally anemic, offering no more than a + button to add tasks, and a dropdown for selecting a tasks list. That’s it. If you need any sorting features, you’ll have to open the full app. I recently stumbled across Tasks.org and its widget has completely changed how I use Google Tasks. It doesn’t replace Tasks but displays all my to-dos from Google’s service while adding functionality.\n\nTasks.org’s widget allows for far more granular task management than the Tasks app itself. I can view and arrange tasks by tag, place, or account. There’s also a search option that I wish Google Tasks offered on its to-do app by default. It’s easy to tweak the widget’s appearance, too, down to the header opacity, the information chips displayed, and the font size. Best of all, the app is open source and completely free.\n\nBreezy Weather\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nThere’s no shortage of brilliant weather widgets available for Android phones. I’ve waxed lyrical about Meteogram in the past, but it’s a technical widget that’s mainly built for weather nerds. As far as simple weather widgets go, Breezy Weather’s Material widgets come closest to emulating Google’s Pixel Weather aesthetic while adding more information and functionality. Its rectangular version makes far better use of its space, displaying the conditions for the next six hours, the current temperature and conditions, and the air quality. It’s far tidier and puts more emphasis on the actual figures rather than the icons.\n\nKWGT\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nGoogle’s oblong Clock widgets are something of an eyesore. I don’t fancy irregular widgets on my home page, and Google gives me little other choice with the available options. I will say that I love the look of the time widget, but I use my smartwatch for this purpose; the same goes for the stopwatch feature. For the most part, I want an attractive clock widget on my home screen. That’s where KWGT excels. I’ve covered the brilliance of this widget creation and customization app before. I used it to build a comprehensive Google widget that funnels to various shortcuts. There’s no need to delve into the app, though. KWGT serves well as a simple clock app.\n\nInoreader\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nGoogle News and Inoreader are two fundamentally different apps. The former is a content delivery service that pushes articles based on what it thinks users want to read. Inoreader is still predicated on the theory that RSS feeds are king. When it comes to serving breaking news, the primary purpose of my news widget is to allow me to pick and choose my sources, which is so important. Therefore, Inoreader gets the nod on my device.\n\nInvesting\n\nAndy Walker / Android Authority\n\nGoogle’s Finance widget is the company’s most attractive, but it uses its available space poorly. I need a finance widget that displays key indicators and forex without fuss. I want to know which are in green and red, and when that information was last updated. Most importantly, I want to be able to glance at this information momentarily. Investing’s watchlist widget best matches these particular needs, allowing a host of tickers in a compact yet legible design.\n\nYou must create an account to use the widget (which draws tickers from your watchlist). I circumvent this limitation by using an old throwaway email address."}

Shri Thanedar, who filed seven articles of impeachment against him on Monday, as “this lunatic.”\n\nTrump, who was unsuccessfully impeached twice during his first term, muttered, “Here we go again.” He stated that Democrats have “no control” over “a dumb guy like this” because “they have no confidence anymore as a party.”\n\nTrump touted accomplishments like pulling the U.S. out of international alliances including the World Health Organization and the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as creating a new DOJ task force focused on “anti-Christian bias.”\n\nTrump also falsely claimed that he had reduced egg prices — one of the key factors in his 2024 campaign — by more than 80%.\n\n“Prices are coming way down,” he continued despite multiple reports from major retailers and manufacturers that they are forced to raise prices because of Trump’s unpopular tariffs. “You know, the fake news is trying to say the prices have gone up,” he said.\n\nHe praised several staunch GOP members, including top White House aide Stephen Miller and MyPillow maker Mike Lindell, but also called out a few less loyal people in the administration, including “a Fed person who’s not really doing a good job,” referring to Jerome Powell, whom he first appointed in 2017 and who was named to a second term by former President Biden in 2021. “You’re not supposed to criticize the Fed,” he said, adding, “I know much more than he does about interest rates.”\n\nTrump criticized “grandstanding Republicans” who have sided with Democrats on certain issues. “Remember who those grandstanders were and vote them the hell out of office,” he urged the audience.\n\nDuring his speech, he urged the crowd to vote for the better term to describe Biden: “Crooked Joe” got more cheers than “Sleepy Joe” from the crowd.\n\nThe president also took issue with “fake news” providing “fake polls,” saying that the 44% approval rating reported in the most recent Fox News poll was probably closer to “60 or 70%,” but accused the pollsters of speaking mostly to Democrats. Earlier on Tuesday, Miller told Fox News they needed to “fire its pollster” after the disappointing results.\n\nThe speech opened to “God Bless America” and closed with “YMCA” by The Village People."}

From water to coffee to paint, these everyday fluids leave behind intricate patterns as they evaporate. But blood is far more complex—a colloidal suspension packed with red blood cells, plasma proteins, salts, and countless biomolecules.\n\nAs blood dries, it leaves behind a complex microstructural pattern—cracks, rings, and folds—each shaped by the interplay of its cellular components, proteins, and evaporation dynamics. These features form a kind of physical fingerprint, quietly recording the complex interplay of physics that unfolded during the desiccation of the droplet.\n\nIn our recent experiments, we explored how blood droplets dry by varying both their size—from tiny 1-microliter drops to larger 10-microliter ones—and the angle of the surface, from completely horizontal to a steep 70° incline. Using an optical microscope, a high-speed camera, and a surface profiler, we tracked how the droplets dried, shrank and cracked.\n\nOur study is published in the journal Langmuir.\n\nOn flat surfaces, blood droplets dried predictably, forming familiar coffee-ring-like deposits surrounded by networks of radial and azimuthal cracks. But as we increased the tilt, gravity pulled the red blood cells downhill, while surface tension tried to hold them up. This resulted in asymmetric deposits and stretched patterns—a kind of biological landslide frozen in time.\n\nCracking patterns were different on the advancing (downhill) and receding (uphill) sides. On the advancing side, where the dried blood mass accumulated more, the cracks were thicker and more widely spaced. On the receding side, where the deposit thinned out, the cracks were finer. Larger droplets (10 microliter) exaggerated the asymmetry even more, with gravity playing a bigger role as the droplets grew heavier—leaving behind a long, thin \"tail\" of blood that dried and showed scattered dried red blood cells.\n\nTo explain what we observed, we developed a first-order theoretical model showing how mechanical stresses build up unevenly on either side of the droplet—a difference that helps explain the asymmetric cracking patterns we saw.\n\nThese findings have real-world implications. In forensic science, for example, investigators use bloodstain pattern analysis—or BPA—to reconstruct events at crime scenes. Our results suggest that both the tilt of the surface and the size of the droplet can significantly alter the resulting patterns. Ignoring these factors could lead to misinterpretations, potentially affecting how such evidence is read and understood.\n\nThis story is part of Science X Dialog, where researchers can report findings from their published research articles.

Now we know why", "fullContent": "Windows 7 came onto the market in 2009 and put Microsoft back on the road to success after Windows Vista’s annoying failures. But Windows 7 was not without its faults, as this curious story proves.\n\nSome users apparently encountered a vexing problem at the time: if they set a single-color image as the background, their Windows 7 PC always took 30 seconds to start the operating system and switch from the welcome screen to the desktop.\n\nget windows 11 pro for cheap Windows 11 Pro\n\nIn a recent blog post, Microsoft veteran Raymond Chen explains the exact reason for this. According to him, a simple programming error meant that users had to wait longer for the system to boot. After logging in, Windows 7 first set up the desktop piece by piece, i.e. the taskbar, the desktop window, icons for applications, and even the background image.\n\nThe system waited patiently for all components to finish loading and received feedback from each individual component. Or, it switched from the welcome screen to the desktop after 30 seconds if it didn’t receive any feedback.\n\nThe problem here: The code for the message that the background image is ready was located within the background image bitmap code, which means that the message never appeared if you did not have a real background image bitmap. And a single color is not such a bitmap.\n\nThe result: the logon system waited in vain for the message that the background has finished loading, so Windows 7 never started until the 30 second fallback activated and sent users to the desktop.\n\nThe problem could also occur if users had activated the “Hide desktop icons” group policy. This was due to the fact that such policies were only added after the main code had been written and called by an If statement. However, Windows 7 was also unable to recognise this at first and therefore took longer to load.\n\nChen shows the following code snippet as an example to illustrate the problem:\n\n// Original code InitialiseDesktopIcons() { bind to the desktop folder enumerate the icons add them to the screen Report(DesktopIconsReady); } // Updated with group policy support InitialiseDesktopIcons() { if (desktop icons allowed by policy) { bind to the desktop folder enumerate the icons add them to the screen Report(DesktopIconsReady); } }\n\nUnsolved for months\n\nAccording to Chen, it took several months for Microsoft to recognize the problem. In November 2009, it was then fixed by an update and has not been a problem since, but is a nice anecdote for the various errors that can occur during programming."}

That depends a lot on how you measure “good” and in how many different ways. Conventional browser-based tests like the ever-popular Speedtest.net can give you a few metrics, but it’s missing a lot of deeper data. A new test from the founders of Ookla, SpeedTest’s parent company, hopes to give you a better, always-on option.\n\nOrb opens today as an app for all major desktop and mobile platforms. It’s designed to give you a deeper, more holistic look at your active internet connection, with real-time monitoring, more useful and active information, and a better look at your connection over time. It shows you zero-to-100 scores for responsiveness (based on latency, jitter, and packet loss), reliability (status over time and packet loss), and speed (download/upload).\n\nIn addition to raw data and your overall scores, the system has a couple of other tricks. By logging in, you can actively monitor multiple devices at once, even on separate connections — I’m looking at my desktop connection on my home network and my phone on Verizon in the same window. And for those who really like to keep a tight watch on their network, the Orb app can be installed on a Raspberry Pi or similar device for round-the-clock monitoring of a LAN. I like the “keep awake” option for the Android app, allowing my phone to essentially become an always-on network monitor.\n\nOrb\n\nAccording to a PR representative, Orb is planning to release “recipes” that will allow you to test your connectivity for specific services, giving YouTube and Microsoft Teams as examples. I can think of a few others that some of the most network-obsessed users would also like to test, such as Valve, EA, and Microsoft’s online multiplayer servers.\n\nOrb is a free download for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux.

Don’t Ask the New York Times.", "fullContent": "A sign posted outside the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Mass., on April 23, 2024. Photo: Mel Musto/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to how it treats different groups on campus, Harvard wants the world to know that it is balanced. It cares about all groups equally. So naturally, on Tuesday, when it issued a lengthy report about antisemitism at Harvard, the university also issued a lengthy report on Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias at Harvard.\n\nThe reports reveal a profound imbalance at Harvard. One group, overwhelmingly, feels unwelcome and unsafe. You’d never know which group that is, however, from reading the New York Times.\n\nBefore I say anything else — and there is much to say — it’s important to note that how the New York Times reports this news will loom large in the public imagination and has the potential to do much damage.\n\nConsider these two paragraphs, which get buried two-thirds of the way into the New York Times piece on the two Harvard reports:\n\nThe two task forces worked together to create a campuswide survey that received nearly 2,300 responses from faculty, staff and students. It found that 6 percent of Christian respondents reported feeling physically unsafe on campus, while 15 percent of Jewish respondents and 47 percent of Muslim respondents reported the same. (The university does not track the total population of these groups on campus.) In addition to the 92 percent of Muslim respondents who worried about expressing their views, 51 percent of Christian respondents and 61 percent of Jewish respondents said they felt the same way.\n\nGot that?\n\nFor all the articles, claims, reports, think pieces, op-eds, statements, and speeches from elected politicians and other worthies about rampant antisemitism on campus, these two massive reports discover that the one group on campus — whether we are talking about faculty, students, or staff — that most consistently feels nervous about expressing its views and most consistently feels physically unsafe on campus are … Muslims.\n\nWe are often asked to take the feelings and perceptions of Jewish students, faculty, and staff as proxies for the objective safety and security and sense of welcome that Jewish people do or do not feel on campuses across the country. Yet, according to their self-reported experiences in the new Harvard studies, Jewish students, faculty, and staff at Harvard consistently feel more welcome, safer, and freer to be Jews, including being Zionist Jews, than do Muslims at Harvard.\n\nOne-sided “Ism”\n\nWith that in mind, let’s look at how the Times led off its piece:\n\nA Harvard task force released a scathing account of the university on Tuesday, finding that antisemitism had infiltrated coursework, social life, the hiring of some faculty members and the worldview of certain academic programs. A separate report on anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian bias on campus, also released on Tuesday, found widespread discomfort and alienation among those students as well, with 92 percent of Muslim survey respondents saying they believed they would face an academic or professional penalty for expressing their political opinions.\n\nNotice a few things.\n\nThe Times leads with the report on antisemitism, giving second billing to the report on anti-Arab, anti-Muslim, and anti-Palestinian sentiment. Given the statistics the Times itself reports deep into the piece, it seems like an odd choice of order.\n\nAlso notice the terminology. On the one hand, we have “antisemitism.” Antisemitism is an “ism,” in the family of racism, so it instantly calls to mind the worst social evil. There’s nothing comparable when it comes to the triptych of “anti-Arab, anti-Muslim, and anti-Palestinian bias.”\n\nAccording to the syntax of the paragraphs, the “ism” of antisemitism is the actor and the agent. It can do grave harm, infiltrating and influencing the entire campus. It is an objective thing — what Émile Durkheim called a social fact. When it comes to anti-Arab, anti-Muslim, and anti-Palestinian bias, the objective reality of the thing of racism dissolves into the feelings of students. It becomes a subjective perception or opinion of the alleged victims, who may or may not be victims at all.\n\nAlong the same lines, antisemitism conjoins a range of issues, including the multiple shades of criticism of Israel, into a single form: hatred of the Jews. On the other side, there’s no such unity of terms. Instead, we get an uncertain and floating array of different “biases”: against a religion, against an ethnicity, against a group that many of Israel’s supporters don’t even acknowledge are a people, much less a nation.\n\n\n\nRead our complete coverage Chilling Dissent\n\nScary Words for One Side\n\nI bring this issue up not to contest the reality of antisemitism; that would be absurd. Nor am I making the by now familiar — though increasingly obscured — point that people conflate anti-Zionism with antisemitism, a central feature of the battles unfolding on campuses. (In six months to a year, I suspect almost everyone who is not a hardcore advocate of the Palestinian cause will no longer even notice the conflation and just assume that anti-Zionism is antisemitism.)\n\nInstead, I want to point out that, when it comes to the Jews, society has a unifying term for a variety of distinct phenomena — ranging from criticism of the policies of a state, criticism of the way that state has organized and defined itself, to animus against a religion, an ethnicity, a people, and so on.\n\nYet we have no such term for what may be as unified an animus as antisemitism is supposed to be, even if that animus is directed at different groups — Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims — and expressed in different ways. “Orientalism” might be a good candidate, but after more than 40 years, it remains an academic term of art. The absence of such a term immediately gives the advantage in the conversation and the debate over Israel to one side.\n\nIn the opening paragraph on the report on antisemitism, the Times uses words like “scathing,” “infiltrated,” “social life,” and “worldview” to describe the state of the Jews on campus. Not only are the words alarming and scary, but they indict all levels of the institution, from its hiring practices to its curricular decisions to the everyday life of students, faculty, and staff.\n\nWhen it comes to the report on Islamophobia and anti-Arabism, the issue is reduced to the “discomfort and alienation” of “students” only. That is drastically at odds with the fallout from campus debates for pro-Palestine scholarship and scholars. Entire Middle East studies departments are under review for purported pro-Palestine views; law review articles are being suppressed; staffers are being let go after airing pro-Palestine views; distinguished professors are being pushed out and retiring in the face of attacks.\n\nAgain, I want to remind us of this critical fact, buried in the mess of words that is this piece: The one group on campus, whether among the faculty, students, or staff, that most consistently feels nervous about expressing its views and most consistently feels physically unsafe on campus are … Muslims. Not Jews.\n\nOne would think that should give our larger conversation about antisemitism on campus some pause. Judging by this article, it won’t. Readers and writers and politicians and editors and campus leaders and cultural elites will just fly by the fact of the matter."}

Four winged creatures, each with four faces, emerged, borne on a fiery wind, drawing a bejeweled chariot (merkavah). In the air above them, God sat on a sapphire throne and said, “O Mortal, stand up on your feet that I may speak to you” (Ezek. 2:1).\n\nSeveral centuries later, Jewish mystics, including, at least by legend, Rabbi Akiva, attempted to re-create Ezekiel’s vision, known as the Ma’aseh Merkavah. They developed complex meditative techniques to induce spiritual journeys through the heavens (though, paradoxically, they were generally said to descend rather than ascend). In these visions, they progressed through a series of seven concentric, glimmering palaces guarded by fearsome angels in search of the divine throne.\n\nEzekiel’s Vision by Raphael. (Courtesy of The Japan Times/Wikimedia Commons.)\n\nAbout two thousand years later, in the summer of 1947, a rancher named William “Mac” Brazel discovered strange metallic debris scattered across his remote land outside of Roswell, New Mexico. He reported it to the local sheriff, who got the US Air Force involved, since they had a base nearby. A day later, the Air Force issued a press release stating that it recovered a “flying disc” from the ranch—and the story, or myth, of the Roswell UFO was born.\n\nIn 2017 the New York Times revealed the existence of a UFO program at the Pentagon. Since then, UFOs—or UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena)—have stayed in the news and, perhaps, the skies. There have been military and civilian sightings, leaks from whistleblowers, alarming congressional hearings, startling official reports, and, most recently, a frenzy over thousands of apparent drone sightings in New Jersey. In 2023, then-Senator Marco Rubio (now secretary of state) said that secret Pentagon UFO programs represent, “in essence, some sort of an internal military complex that’s their own government and is accountable to no one.” A recent CBS News poll indicated that 78 percent of Americans believe the government is withholding information from the public.\n\n\n\nIn Intimate Alien: The Hidden Story of the UFO, David J. Halperin, a distinguished historian of religion who has published studies of the prophet Ezekiel, Merkavah mysticism, and other Jewish visionary experiences, seeks to explain the long-smoldering American fascination with aliens through the lenses of religious studies and Jungian psychology. In doing so, he aims to build what he calls a bridge between “reported existence and postulated cause” for a series of famous UFO cases and motifs, including Roswell.\n\nAlthough Halperin is not the first scholar of religious studies to tackle UFOs, the subject is more personal for him than most. In 1960, he was twelve years old, the only child of a distant father and a dying mother. The three of them maintained a conspiratorial silence about the reality of her condition despite her dreadful physical state: “arms and legs spindly, belly swollen.” Death, Halperin writes in Intimate Alien, was the “ultimate alien” penetrating their lives.\n\nDriven by the need to externalize this aura of familial mystery, Halperin threw himself into investigating UFOs, starting a local club and eventually becoming the teenage director of the New Jersey Association on Aerial Phenomena. In the spring of 1964, he won a Bible contest and was awarded a summer trip to Israel. He was gone for eight weeks; when he returned, his mother was dead.\n\nHalperin is brutally honest about this loss and its complex aftereffects. Although he suffered terrible grief, he admits that “in some ways life was better now.” His father, freed from the burden of his wife’s terminal condition, became calmer and kinder. Young David underwent changes of his own: He went to more parties, reconnected with friends, and even managed to kiss a girl or two. (He is frank and unsparing about the psychosexual origins of his own and others’ UFO obsessions and visionary experience more generally.)\n\nAs life normalized, Halperin’s UFO obsession gradually faded. He graduated from high school and went off to Cornell, where he buried himself in Near East languages, then on to Berkeley, where he wrote a doctoral dissertation on Merkavah mysticism. Later, as a professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he would write a Jungian psychobiography of the prophet Ezekiel.\n\nUpon his retirement, Halperin returned to the world of UFOs—although perhaps he never really left. In 2011, he published an odd and ambitious young adult novel called Journal of a UFO Investigator. It follows Danny Shapiro, whose early-1960s adolescent biography (sick mom, no girlfriend, Christian dad) closely mirrors Halperin’s own. Danny’s UFO research leads him to a chance encounter at the library with a suave older teen named Julian Margulies, who inducts him into the S.S.S. (Secret Science Society). There he meets Tom and his seductive girlfriend, Rochelle, and the three S.S.S. members quickly hook Danny into a surreal globe-trotting caper centered around a coveted copy of a UFO book that has been annotated by the mysterious, all-knowing “Gypsies.”\n\nThe plot of Halperin’s novel is fractured, weaving in and out of Danny’s journal entries, actual experiences, and dreams as we follow his journey through the wild world of the S.S.S. He gets his hands on the annotated book; is captured and tortured by the Men in Black, the government agents feared by so-called ufologists; and eventually escapes into a disc-shaped UFO, only to discover himself a prisoner again.\n\nDanny’s abduction experience is bizarre and brilliantly rendered. Halperin imparts an uneasy and somehow archetypal sense of horror. Danny’s UFO goes down instead of up (recalling, perhaps, the descent of the Merkavah mystics), burrowing deep into the core of the Earth before stopping in a strange swampy clearing, where a dark fluid’s surface is lit by an impossibly low-hanging moon.\n\nHere, Danny is confronted by six-legged clawed creatures the size of dogs, who telepathically urge him to drink from the marsh and send him ambiguous brain messages about the seeding. He has sex with a humanoid alien seductress, which is not unpleasant but also, it turns out, not the seeding. Then the real ceremony begins: He is placed on an altar by the eldritch creatures and sliced open so that they can surgically extract his seed. The nightmare surrealism of this scene is rare in science fiction, let alone young adult novels. Halperin lets the reader marinate in the weirdness of these images, without resolution. Here and elsewhere, the novel evokes the visceral body horror of David Cronenberg films like The Brood and The Fly.\n\nA photo of a purported UFO over Passaic, New Jersey, in 1952. (Courtesy of World History Archive/Alamy Stock Photo.)\n\nThereafter the plot moves quickly—too quickly. Danny travels to the Well of Souls cave under the Dome of the Rock in then-Jordanian-held East Jerusalem, where he confronts the ghost of his grandfather before sneaking across the border with his hybrid alien baby into Israel, so she can receive medical care. Eventually, he finds and reenters the UFO, which he pilots into the welcoming sky, baby swaddled against his chest like a midcentury mom navigating her Buick sedan before the advent of safety laws. After takeoff, however, he is distracted by a plane leaving Lod Airport. He flies alongside it and somehow sees himself in the plane. The UFO lurches into a celestial tailspin, crashing in . . .\n\nRoswell, New Mexico.\n\nThe best chapters of Journal of a UFO Investigator reach dizzying, surrealist heights: Lovecraftian dream sequences in a Dune-ish setting that revolve around a miserably horny teenage Jew from Jersey. But its lesser elements, like Danny’s encounters with the government Men in Black (whom he dubs Snaggletooth and Pockmark), read as if they were airlifted in from a sci-fi drugstore novel of his adolescence. What is perhaps more interesting is that this erratic, ambitious, oneiric novel—written for God only knows whom—is a kind of first draft or autobiographical key to Halperin’s sober (more or less) academic theory of UFO phenomena and their place in modern culture.\n\n\n\nIn Intimate Alien, Halperin argues reasonably enough that UFOs emerge from the gap between “stimulus and perception.” Real physical phenomena—stars, planes, weather balloons, drones—trigger transcendent visions as they are filtered through a complex interplay of cultural archetypes and personal psychology. The witnesses really do see something, and the contents of the individual and collective unconscious are real too, but we are not visited by extraterrestrial spacecraft, and no earthlings were actually kidnapped or harmed in the making of these experiences.\n\nIn 1958, Carl Jung himself took something like this approach. In Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies, Jung argued forcefully for the significance of UFOs to the modern psyche. Flying saucers were mandala-shaped myths, hovering projections of our cosmic anxieties (according to Jung, the circular mandala was a universal symbol of the self). This tack is at the core of Halperin’s psychosocial approach. “I don’t believe, nor do I debunk,” he writes, proposing a “third way” that treats UFO encounters with the same gravity one would accord other myths that emerge from the collective unconscious.\n\nAs one would expect, given his personal biography and academic method, Halperin approaches UFO narratives with great respect. And yet he ends updebunking every UFO encounter he writes about. “Did it really happen?” is the least interesting question about a UFO account for Halperin, but he invariably concludes that it didn’t.\n\nIn this Halperin differs from the famous French ufologist Jacques Vallée and others influenced by him, including Halperin’s more sensationalist colleague in religious studies Diana Pasulka, who have pointed to the many mystical experiences and premodern legends that are strikingly similar to alien encounters. Where Halperin sees this as evidence of a long-existent psychological phenomenon, these scholars tend to suggest that visitations from another realm are a perennial feature of human experience, whose origins only came to be represented (or recognized) as extraterrestrial in the latter half of the twentieth century.\n\nVallée, who began his professional career as an astronomer—he worked on NASA’s first map of Mars in the early 1960s—has proposed that these are encounters with beings from another dimension rather than another planet. (A character based on him is played by the great French New Wave director François Truffaut in Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind.) Though he has spent the better part of a lifetime obsessing over such experiences, Halperin doesn’t buy into their reality—in this universe or a parallel one.\n\n\n\nIn September 1961, Barney and Betty Hill were driving down a dark New Hampshire road when they spotted a bright light in the sky, moving in strange patterns. When they pulled over to look closer, the light swooped down toward them, revealing itself as an enormous disc-shaped craft with figures watching from illuminated windows. The Hills sped away in terror, only to be overtaken by strange beeping sounds and an overwhelming drowsiness. They arrived home the next morning with strange marks on their bodies, torn clothing, and faint sensory memories of the first-reported alien abduction in American history.\n\nSkeptics think that the Hills lied or hallucinated. But Halperin makes it clear that the Hills are not so easily dismissed. Neither had any preexisting interest in UFOs, and they didn’t try to monetize their experience later. They couldn’t account for two full hours of that night, had mysterious damage to their car and clothes, and gave consistent parallel accounts (as well as severe trauma responses) under hypnosis in isolated sessions. Both of the Hills were gainfully employed and sober, respected members of their community when the incident happened.\n\nThe Flying Saucer film poster, USA, 1950. (Retro AdArchives / Alamy Stock Photo.)\n\nThey did, however, stand out in one way: Barney was black, and Betty was white. They were a married interracial couple at a time when such marriages were illegal in many states and uncommon everywhere else. Halperin’s exhaustive analysis of the transcripts of their hypnosis reveals how deeply race colored their everyday experiences. Something as simple as finding a motel room in the wrong city became what Halperin calls “an exercise in courage.”\n\nHere Halperin makes an astute observation about the evolution of Barney’s story. In his initial account to a UFO investigator, he said the aliens “reminded” him of German officers. But under hypnosis nearly four years later, he described his abductor as “a German Nazi. . . . He had a black scarf . . . black shiny jacket.” What changed? Halperin locates the shift in Barney’s growing attachment to his Jewish hypnotist, Dr. Benjamin Simon.\n\nBut Halperin’s boldest conjecture connects their abduction experience to the historical trauma of the Atlantic slave trade:\n\nYou were abducted, perhaps in a night raid\n\n. . . marched to the coast, your destination an alien craft. . . . To the Africans in first contact with them, the slave ships were something altogether fantastic.\n\nHalperin argues that Barney and Betty Hill, who were descended from slaves and (perhaps) slave owners, respectively, “relived that trauma” together, their psyches unconsciously putting on a mythological coproduction in “hidden tandem.” He goes on to compare this to the “unvocalized deep memory” that the children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors carry with them.\n\nAgain, perhaps. But what were the real-world stimuli for the Hills’ otherworldly experience? Here we get Halperin at his most empirical.\n\nThere was an observation tower light atop a nearby mountain; if you were driving through this particular stretch of New Hampshire in the middle of the night, it might look like it was following you. What’s more, Hill reported one of the aliens as having “wraparound eyes” that stretched to their temples. This happens to also describe an alien on an episode of the sci-fi TV show The Outer Limits that aired just twelve days before hypnosis. Thus, Halperin synthesizes primary and secondary sources to demonstrate how mundane stimuli were transformed, through the psychology of racial trauma and the influence of pop culture, into America’s foundational alien abduction myth.\n\n\n\nErich von Däniken popularized the idea that Ezekiel’s vision of the chariot was actually an ancient spaceship sighting in his late-60s bestseller Chariots of the Gods? But the interpretation goes back at least to a 1961 sci-fi magazine article titled “The Four-Faced Visitors of Ezekiel,” mentioned here by Halperin. He dismisses this idea as a boring and anachronistic conventionalization of a numinous experience, though given his intellectual biography, it is hard to believe that he never found the identification interesting, even beguiling; indeed, he has described Ezekiel’s vision as a premodern parallel to UFO sightings.\n\nBook cover for Chariot of the Gods.\n\nHalperin’s larger point is about the nature of mystical experience in general. Of the Ma’aseh Merkavah, he writes that even “‘calling it visions of God,’ as Ezekiel himself does, is a conventionalization of a different sort. . . . It’s something unknown, indefinable, erupting from within Ezekiel yet outside his conscious control.” Such experiences are before all conceptual frameworks, ancient and modern, and cannot ultimately be explained or contained by them. Or almost all frameworks, for Halperin does appear to think that Jungian theory is more than another conventionalization; it sounds the depths. Hence, for instance, the symbolic significance of Ezekiel’s four creatures with four faces is that they form a quaternity, which in Jungian symbolism is the deep symbol of wholeness.\n\nThis is not to say that Halperin’s approach does not yield insights. It clearly fascinates him that the Merkavah mystics were “descenders to the chariot” who paradoxically had to first go down before ascending to the heavenly palaces. Following Scholem and others, Halperin connects this to the mystics’ practice of dipping their heads to their knees in meditation. He compares it to the shamanic practice of entering trance states and further notes the parallels to the hypnotic regression undergone by UFO abductees in the recounting of their experience. Halperin suggests that the place to which all these journeyers descend is “surely the unconscious.”\n\n\n\nThe limitations of Halperin’s Jungian psychosocial approach arise most vividly when he takes on the task of complex cases with larger casts of players. His analysis of the Roswell incident, for example, feels relatively underbaked. The problem with Roswell has always been whom to believe and how to explain the testimony of those one doesn’t.\n\nOn July 8, 1947, the Air Force put out a press release on the recovery of a “flying disc.” By July 10 they had changed their story, holding a press conference in which the “disc” had become a “weather balloon.” Air Force officials even staged a photo op with the supposed debris. In 1978, Air Force Maj. Jesse Marcel, who transported the original materials, claimed the press conference debris was fake and alleged a cover-up. By 1994, under political pressure, the Air Force offered yet another explanation: The debris came from a Project Mogul spy balloon, used to detect sound waves from enemy nuclear installations. (In 2020, President Trump said he had heard some “very interesting” things about Roswell but wouldn’t tell even his eldest son, Don Jr.)\n\nMajor Jesse Marcel holding foil debris from Roswell, New Mexico. (Photo by Erin Thompson, Fort Worth Star-Telegram.)\n\nA Roswell skeptic like Halperin must explain that first press release—why would the Air Force announce the recovery of a flying disc that didn’t exist? Halperin is forced to suggest that Air Force Col. William H. Blanchard and his subordinates fell under the spell of “the core [UFO] myth, of a celestial entity descended to earth,” which “overrode the plain evidence of their eyes as to what lay before them. Like Jonah’s gourd in the Bible, it sprang up in the day and perished that night.” In his attempt to avoid endorsing extraordinary claims about alien spacecraft, Halperin ends up proposing something perhaps almost as extraordinary—a synchronized mass hallucination powerful enough to generate official military communications.\n\nAlthough Halperin’s framework offers profound insights into cases like the Hills’ UFO encounter, its utility is less clear when multiple witnesses and official documentation are involved. Take the 2004 USS Nimitz “Tic Tac” incident (revealed in late 2017) when several Navy pilots reported a structured craft performing impossible maneuvers at top speed; their testimony was apparently corroborated by as-yet unreleased radar data.\n\nOn his blog, Halperin breaks down a 60 Minutes segment on the Tic Tac. Although he is skeptical, one detail of the pilots’ account—the UFO mirroring the movement of the planes—stands out to him, as that detail is mirrored itself in various UFO accounts over the years. This is enough for him to take the pilots seriously as witnesses, suggesting their experience contains true mystery, albeit mystery that emerges from the collective unconscious instead of another planet. (In another blog post on the Nimitz encounter, he gets more Jungian, writing obliquely about secondary and female pilot Alex Dietrich’s appearance on the scene in 2021 as somehow an obscure reflection, or projection, of the “national ‘second’ [in command],” Kamala Harris.)\n\nHalperin’s near-mystical mode of psychological parsing falters when confronted with military witnesses, corroborating data, and institutional communications. Nonetheless, there is real value in this approach, and Halperin, who has collected wild Jewish visions in Sabbatai Zevi: Testimonies to a Fallen Messiah, could productively extend his approach to, say, mythical anecdotes about the Lubavitcher Rebbe (or Marian apparitions). However, he was a ufologist long before he turned to religious studies or Jung, and every page of Intimate Alien betrays his lasting fascination with this topic. Halperin has spent more than six decades wrestling with the UFO phenomenon, and he is refreshingly honest about the origins and extremity of this obsession, which led not only to his academic career but to the main occupation of his retirement.\n\nJung mandala. (From Memories, Dreams, Reflections by Carl Jung and Aniela Jaffé, 1963.)\n\nUFOs occupy a seductive position at the edges of our culture, occasionally flashing into sight: an abduction story here, a congressional hearing there. But after eighty years of so-called whistleblowers, mimeographed newsletters, Reddit detectives, and underfunded government probes, the question most people who turn to books on the phenomenon want answered is: Could these things (or some of them) possibly be real?\n\nOne does not come away from David J. Halperin’s books, articles, and blog posts on the subject with an answer to this question. Instead, his Jungian inquiry into the subject leaves the reader with a series of arresting images: a car idling on the shoulder, a married couple standing rigid beneath a spectral light. An ancient priest prostrate in the face of a bizarre vision, too grand to comprehend. And a little Jewish boy from New Jersey, staring at the sky, desperate to transcend the reality of his fractured life at home."}

By reading this article, you can apply these insights to save yourself and your SEO clients time, money, and frustration – in less than an hour.\n\nLesson #1: Technical SEO Is Your Foundation For SEO Success\n\nLesson: You should always start any SEO work with technical fundamentals; crawlability and indexability determine whether search engines can even see your site.\n\nTechnical SEO ensures search engines can crawl, index, and fully understand your content. If search engines can’t properly access your site, no amount of quality content or backlinks will help.\n\nAfter auditing over 500 websites, I believe technical SEO is the most critical aspect of SEO, which comes down to two fundamental concepts:\n\nCrawlability : Can search engines easily find and navigate your website’s pages?\n\n: Can search engines easily find and navigate your website’s pages? Indexability: Once crawled, can your pages appear in search results?\n\nIf your pages fail these two tests, they won’t even enter the SEO game — and your SEO efforts won’t matter.\n\nI strongly recommend regularly monitoring your technical SEO health using at least two essential tools: Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.\n\nWhen starting any SEO audit, always ask yourself these two critical questions:\n\nCan Google, Bing, or other search engines crawl and index my important pages?\n\nAm I letting search engine bots crawl only the right pages?\n\nThis step alone can save you huge headaches and ensure no major technical SEO blockages.\n\n→ Read more: 13 Steps To Boost Your Site’s Crawlability And Indexability\n\nLesson #2: JavaScript SEO Can Easily Go Wrong\n\nLesson: You should be cautious when relying heavily on JavaScript. It can easily prevent Google from seeing and indexing critical content.\n\nJavaScript adds great interactivity, but search engines (even as smart as Google) often struggle to process it reliably.\n\nGoogle handles JavaScript in three steps (crawling, rendering, and indexing) using an evergreen Chromium browser. However, rendering delays (from minutes to weeks) and limited resources can prevent important content from getting indexed.\n\nI’ve audited many sites whose SEO was failing because key JavaScript-loaded content wasn’t visible to Google.\n\nTypically, important content was missing from the initial HTML, it didn’t load properly during rendering, or there were significant differences between the raw HTML and rendered HTML when it came to content or meta elements.\n\nYou should always test if Google can see your JavaScript-based content:\n\nUse the Live URL Test in Google Search Console and verify rendered HTML.\n\nOr, search Google for a unique sentence from your JavaScript content (in quotes). If your content isn’t showing up, Google probably can’t index it.*\n\n*This will only work for URLs that are already in Google’s index.\n\nHere are a few best practices regarding JavaScript SEO:\n\nCritical content in HTML: You should include titles, descriptions, and important content directly in the initial HTML so search engines can index it immediately. You should remember that Google doesn’t scroll or click.\n\nYou should include titles, descriptions, and important content directly in the initial HTML so search engines can index it immediately. You should remember that Google doesn’t scroll or click. Server-Side Rendering (SSR): You should consider implementing SSR to serve fully rendered HTML. It’s more reliable and less resource-intensive for search engines.\n\nYou should consider implementing SSR to serve fully rendered HTML. It’s more reliable and less resource-intensive for search engines. Proper robots.txt setup: Websites should block essential JavaScript files needed for rendering, as this prevents indexing.\n\nWebsites should block essential JavaScript files needed for rendering, as this prevents indexing. Use crawlable URLs: You should ensure each page has a unique, crawlable URL. You should also avoid URL fragments (#section) for important content; they often don’t get indexed.\n\nFor a full list of JavaScript SEO common errors and best practices, you can navigate to the JavaScript SEO guide for SEO pros and developers.\n\n→ Read more: 6 JavaScript Optimization Tips From Google\n\nLesson #3: Crawl Budget Matters, But Only If Your Website Is Huge\n\nLesson: You should only worry about the crawl budget if your website has hundreds of thousands or millions of pages.\n\nCrawl budget refers to how many pages a search engine like Google crawls on your site within a certain timeframe. It’s determined by two main factors:\n\nCrawl capacity limit: This prevents Googlebot from overwhelming your server with too many simultaneous requests.\n\nThis prevents Googlebot from overwhelming your server with too many simultaneous requests. Crawl demand: This is based on your site’s popularity and how often content changes.\n\nNo matter what you hear or read on the internet, most websites don’t need to stress about crawl budget at all. Google typically handles crawling efficiently for smaller websites.\n\nBut for huge websites – especially those with millions of URLs or daily-changing content – crawl budget becomes critical (as Google confirms in its crawl budget documentation).\n\nIn this case, you need to ensure that Google prioritizes and crawls important pages frequently without wasting resources on pages that should never be crawled or indexed.\n\nYou can check your crawl budget health using Google Search Console’s Indexing report. Pay attention to:\n\nCrawled – Currently Not Indexed: This usually indicates indexing problems, not crawl budget.\n\nThis usually indicates indexing problems, not crawl budget. Discovered – Currently Not Indexed: This typically signals crawl budget issues.\n\nYou should also regularly review Google Search Console’s Crawl Stats report to see how many pages Google crawls per day. Comparing crawled pages with total pages on your site helps you spot inefficiencies.\n\nWhile those quick checks in GSC naturally won’t replace log file analysis, they will give quick insights into possible crawl budget issues and may suggest that a detailed log file analysis may be necessary.\n\n→ Read more: 9 Tips To Optimize Crawl Budget For SEO\n\nThis brings us to the next point.\n\nLesson #4: Log File Analysis Lets You See The Entire Picture\n\nLesson: Log file analysis is a must for many websites. It reveals details you can’t see otherwise and helps diagnose problems with crawlability and indexability that affect your site’s ability to rank.\n\nLog files track every visit from search engine bots, like Googlebot or Bingbot. They show which pages are crawled, how often, and what the bots do. This data lets you spot issues and decide how to fix them.\n\nFor example, on an ecommerce site, you might find Googlebot crawling product pages, adding items to the cart, and removing them, wasting your crawl budget on useless actions.\n\nWith this insight, you can block those cart-related URLs with parameters to save resources so that Googlebot can crawl and index valuable, indexable canonical URLs.\n\nHere is how you can make use of log file analysis:\n\nStart by accessing your server access logs, which record bot activity.\n\nLook at what pages bots hit most, how frequently they visit, and if they’re stuck on low-value URLs.\n\nYou don’t need to analyze logs manually. Tools like Screaming Frog Log File Analyzer make it easy to identify patterns quickly.\n\nIf you notice issues, like bots repeatedly crawling URLs with parameters, you can easily update your robots.txt file to block those unnecessary crawls\n\nGetting log files isn’t always easy, especially for big enterprise sites where server access might be restricted.\n\nIf that’s the case, you can use the aforementioned Google Search Console’s Crawl Stats, which provides valuable insights into Googlebot’s crawling activity, including pages crawled, crawl frequency, and response times.\n\nWhile log files offer the most detailed view of search engine interactions, even a quick check in Crawl Stats helps you spot issues you might otherwise miss.\n\n→ Read more: 14 Must-Know Tips For Crawling Millions Of Webpages\n\nLesson #5: Core Web Vitals Are Overrated. Stop Obsessing Over Them\n\nLesson: You should focus less on Core Web Vitals. They rarely make or break SEO results.\n\nCore Web Vitals measure loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability, but they do not influence SEO as significantly as many assume.\n\nAfter auditing over 500 websites, I’ve rarely seen Core Web Vitals alone significantly improve rankings.\n\nMost sites only see measurable improvement if their loading times are extremely poor – taking more than 30 seconds – or have critical issues flagged in Google Search Console (where everything is marked in red).\n\nI’ve watched clients spend thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars, chasing perfect Core Web Vitals scores while overlooking fundamental SEO basics, such as content quality or keyword strategy.\n\nRedirecting those resources toward content and foundational SEO improvements usually yields way better results.\n\nWhen evaluating Core Web Vitals, you should focus exclusively on real-world data from Google Search Console (as opposed to lab data in Google PageSpeed Insights) and consider users’ geographic locations and typical internet speeds.\n\nIf your users live in urban areas with reliable high-speed internet, Core Web Vitals won’t affect them much. But if they’re rural users on slower connections or older devices, site speed and visual stability become critical.\n\nThe bottom line here is that you should always base your decision to optimize Core Web Vitals on your specific audience’s needs and real user data – not just industry trends.\n\n→ Read more: Are Core Web Vitals A Ranking Factor?\n\nLesson #6: Use Schema (Structured Data) To Help Google Understand & Trust You\n\nLesson: You should use structured data (Schema) to tell Google who you are, what you do, and why your website deserves trust and visibility.\n\nSchema Markup (or structured data) explicitly defines your content’s meaning, which helps Google easily understand the main topic and context of your pages.\n\nCertain schema types, like rich results markup, allow your listings to display extra details, such as star ratings, event information, or product prices. These “rich snippets” can grab attention in search results and increase click-through rates.\n\nYou can think of schema as informative labels for Google. You can label almost anything – products, articles, reviews, events – to clearly explain relationships and context. This clarity helps search engines understand why your content is relevant for a given query.\n\nYou should always choose the correct schema type (like “Article” for blog posts or “Product” for e-commerce pages), implement it properly with JSON-LD, and carefully test it using Google’s Rich Results Test or Structured Data Testing Tool.\n\nSchema lets you optimize SEO behind the scenes without affecting what your audience sees.\n\nWhile SEO clients often hesitate about changing visible content, they usually feel comfortable adding structured data because it’s invisible to website visitors.\n\n→ Read more: CMO Guide To Schema: How Your Organization Can Implement A Structured Data Strategy\n\nLesson #7: Keyword Research And Mapping Are Everything\n\nLesson: Technical SEO gets you into the game by controlling what search engines can crawl and index. But, the next step – keyword research and mapping – tells them what your site is about and how to rank it.\n\nToo often, websites chase the latest SEO tricks or target broad, competitive keywords without any strategic planning. They skip proper keyword research and rarely invest in keyword mapping, both essential steps to long-term SEO success:\n\nKeyword research identifies the exact words and phrases your audience actually uses to search.\n\nKeyword mapping assigns these researched terms to specific pages and gives each page a clear, focused purpose.\n\nEvery website should have a spreadsheet listing all its indexable canonical URLs.\n\nNext to each URL, there should be the main keyword that the page should target, plus a few related synonyms or variations.\n\nWithout this structure, you’ll be guessing and hoping your pages rank for terms that may not even match your content.\n\nA clear keyword map ensures every page has a defined role, which makes your entire SEO strategy more effective.\n\nThis isn’t busywork; it’s the foundation of a solid SEO strategy.\n\n→ Read more: How To Use ChatGPT For Keyword Research\n\nLesson #8: On-Page SEO Accounts For 80% Of Success\n\nLesson: From my experience auditing hundreds of websites, on-page SEO drives about 80% of SEO results. Yet, only about 1 in 20 or 30 sites I review have done it well. Most get it wrong from the start.\n\nMany websites rush straight into link building, generating hundreds or even thousands of low-quality backlinks with exact-match anchor texts, before laying any SEO groundwork.\n\nThey skip essential keyword research, overlook keyword mapping, and fail to optimize their key pages first.\n\nI’ve seen this over and over: chasing advanced or shiny tactics while ignoring the basics that actually work.\n\nWhen your technical SEO foundation is strong, focusing on on-page SEO can often deliver significant results.\n\nThere are thousands of articles about basic on-page SEO: optimizing titles, headers, and content around targeted keywords.\n\nYet, almost nobody implements all of these basics correctly. Instead of chasing trendy or complex tactics, you should focus first on the essentials:\n\nDo proper keyword research to identify terms your audience actually searches.\n\nMap these keywords clearly to specific pages.\n\nOptimize each page’s title tags, meta descriptions, headers, images, internal links, and content accordingly.\n\nThese straightforward steps are often enough to achieve SEO success, yet many overlook them while searching for complicated shortcuts.\n\n→ Read more: Google E-E-A-T: What Is It & How To Demonstrate It For SEO\n\nLesson #9: Internal Linking Is An Underused But Powerful SEO Opportunity\n\nLesson: Internal links hold more power than overhyped external backlinks and can significantly clarify your site’s structure for Google.\n\nInternal links are way more powerful than most website owners realize.\n\nEveryone talks about backlinks from external sites, but internal linking – when done correctly – can actually make a huge impact.\n\nUnless your website is brand new, improving your internal linking can give your SEO a serious lift by helping Google clearly understand the topic and context of your site and its specific pages.\n\nStill, many websites don’t use internal links effectively. They rely heavily on generic anchor texts like “Read more” or “Learn more,” which tell search engines absolutely nothing about the linked page’s content.\n\nWebsite owners often approach me convinced they need a deep technical audit.\n\nYet, when I take a closer look, their real issue frequently turns out to be poor internal linking or unclear website structure, both making it harder for Google to understand the site’s content and value.\n\nInternal linking can also give a boost to underperforming pages.\n\nFor example, if you have a page with strong external backlinks, linking internally from that high-authority page to weaker ones can pass authority and help those pages rank better.\n\nInvesting a little extra time in improving your internal links is always worth it. They’re one of the easiest yet most powerful SEO tools you have.\n\n→ Read more: Internal Link Structure Best Practices to Boost Your SEO\n\nLesson #10: Backlinks Are Just One SEO Lever, Not The Only One\n\nLesson: You should never blindly chase backlinks to fix your SEO. Build them strategically only after mastering the basics.\n\nSEO audits often show websites placing too much emphasis on backlinks while neglecting many other critical SEO opportunities.\n\nBlindly building backlinks without first covering SEO fundamentals – like removing technical SEO blockages, doing thorough keyword research, and mapping clear keywords to every page – is a common and costly mistake.\n\nEven after getting those basics right, link building should never be random or reactive.\n\nToo often, I see sites start building backlinks simply because their SEO isn’t progressing, hoping more links will magically help. This rarely works.\n\nInstead, you should always approach link building strategically, by first carefully analyzing your direct SERP competitors to determine if backlinks are genuinely your missing element:\n\nLook closely at the pages outranking you.\n\nIdentify whether their advantage truly comes from backlinks or better on-page optimization, content quality, or internal linking.\n\nOnly after ensuring your on-page SEO and internal links are strong and confirming that backlinks are indeed the differentiating factor, should you invest in targeted link building.\n\nTypically, you don’t need hundreds of low-quality backlinks. Often, just a few strategic editorial links or well-crafted SEO press releases can close the gap and improve your rankings.\n\n→ Read more: How To Get Quality Backlinks: 11 Ways That Really Work\n\nLesson #11: SEO Tools Alone Can’t Replace Manual SEO Checks\n\nLesson: You should never trust SEO tools blindly. Always cross-check their findings manually using your own judgment and common sense.\n\nSEO tools make our work faster, easier, and more efficient, but they still can’t fully replicate human analysis or insight.\n\nTools lack the ability to understand context and strategy in the way that SEO professionals do. They usually can’t “connect the dots” or assess the real significance of certain findings.\n\nThis is exactly why every recommendation provided by a tool needs manual verification. You should always evaluate the severity and real-world impact of the issue yourself.\n\nOften, website owners come to me alarmed by “fatal” errors flagged by their SEO tools.\n\nYet, when I manually inspect these issues, most turn out to be minor or irrelevant.\n\nMeanwhile, fundamental aspects of SEO, such as strategic keyword targeting or on-page optimization, are completely missing since no tool can fully capture these nuances.\n\nSEO tools are still incredibly useful because they handle large-scale checks that humans can’t easily perform, like analyzing millions of URLs at once.\n\nHowever, you should always interpret their findings carefully and manually verify the importance and actual impact before taking any action.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAfter auditing hundreds of websites, the biggest pattern I notice isn’t complex technical SEO issues, though they do matter.\n\nInstead, the most frequent and significant problem is simply a lack of a clear, prioritized SEO strategy.\n\nToo often, SEO is done without a solid foundation or clear direction, which makes all other efforts less effective.\n\nAnother common issue is undiagnosed technical problems lingering from old site migrations or updates. These hidden problems can quietly hurt rankings for years if left unresolved.\n\nThe lessons above cover the majority of challenges I encounter daily, but remember: Each website is unique. There’s no one-size-fits-all checklist.\n\nEvery audit must be personalized and consider the site’s specific context, audience, goals, and limitations.\n\nSEO tools and AI are increasingly helpful, but they’re still just tools. Ultimately, your own human judgment, experience, and common sense remain the most critical factors in effective SEO.\n\nMore Resources:\n\nFeatured Image: inspiring.team/Shutterstock"}

The Foundation has highlighted several areas where it will make AI investments to boost Wikipedia's volunteers.\n\nIts upcoming changes will allow Wikipedia's moderators and patrollers to spend their time \"on what they want to accomplish, and not on how to technically achieve it.\" For instance, automating routine and repetitive tasks that don't need human judgment or decisions.\n\nThe non-profit will use AI to improve the discoverability of information on Wikipedia, leaving extra time for human deliberation, judgment, and consensus-building.

Overall, Wikimedia has no plans to replace human curators with AI.\n\n\"The community of volunteers behind Wikipedia is the most important and unique element of Wikipedia’s success. For nearly 25 years, Wikipedia editors have researched, deliberated, discussed, built consensus, and collaboratively written the largest encyclopedia humankind has ever seen,\" the non-profit said.\n\nWhile it's feared that AI may replace human jobs, a recent report from Google suggests using AI tools can boost productivity and help save about 122 hours per year. However, the general public seems more concerned than excited over AI's increased usage in daily life.\n\nWikimedia plans to implement its AI strategy over the next three years and review it annually to make adjustments as needed. One of the challenges it faces is whether to use AI for content generation or content integrity on Wikipedia, given limited resources.\n\nThe non-profit has decided to prioritize using AI to help editors ensure content integrity because new encyclopedic knowledge can only be added at a rate that editors can handle. Investing more in content generation will overwhelm their capacity. However, the balance between moderation and generation might shift over time depending on the need."}

The resulting series of articles describe how Chinese authorities have instrumentalized Interpol \"red notices\" to track down overseas dissidents and how CCP-aligned NGOs have blunted criticism of China at the U.N. Scilla Alecci and the ICIJ team provided an overview of their investigation into “China’s machinery of repression—and how it crushes dissent around the world”:\n\nAs part of the investigation, ICIJ coordinated reporters across five continents to interview targets and analyze their cases. ICIJ also reviewed a 2004 Chinese police textbook and confidential guidelines for domestic security officers dating to 2013. The reporters then compared the tactics described in the internal documents with the experiences of the 105 targets, as well as with secretly recorded police interrogations, and phone calls and text messages between 11 security officers in China and nine targets overseas. The comparison shows the tactics recently deployed against the subjects mirrored the guidelines on how to control individuals labeled as domestic security threats. Half of the targets interviewed by ICIJ and its media partners said the harassment extended to family members back home, who suffered intimidation and were interrogated by police or state security officials one or more times. Several victims told ICIJ that their family members in China or Hong Kong were harassed by police shortly after they had participated in protests or public events overseas. Sixty said they believed they had been followed or were targets of surveillance or spying by Chinese officials or their proxies; 27 said they were victims of an online smear campaign, and 19 said they had received suspicious messages or experienced hacking attempts, including by state actors. Some said their bank accounts in China and Hong Kong had been frozen. Officers from both the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of State Security — two of the Chinese agencies with intelligence capacity — were responsible for intimidating some of the targets and their families, the testimonies show. Twenty-two people said they received physical threats or had been assaulted by civilian CCP supporters. Most of those interviewed by ICIJ and its partners said they had not reported state-sponsored threats to the authorities in their adopted countries, explaining that they feared retaliation from China or didn’t have faith in authorities’ ability to help. Of those who had filed a report, several said police did not follow up on their case or told them that they couldn’t do anything because there was no evidence of a crime. [Source]\n\nThe ICIJ investigation described the phenomenon of Beijing-backed “GONGOs” (government-organized non-governmental organizations) that monitor and intimidate human rights activists critical of the Chinese government. During China’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) session at the U.N. Human Rights Council last year, CDT reported that the number of China-based “civil society” organizations listed in China’s UPR summary report nearly tripled over the course of two UPR cycles from 2013 to 2024, which may have dampened criticism of China’s human rights record. At The Washington Post, reporting in partnership with ICIJ, Greg Miller, Jelena Ćosić, and Tamsin Lee-Smith described the scale of Chinese NGOs at the U.N. that have hidden ties to the CCP:\n\nThe ICIJ investigation identified 106 NGOs that have received U.N. accreditation and are registered in or affiliated with China. At least 59 appear to violate U.N. rules meant to ensure that NGOs testifying in Geneva aren’t doing so under government influence or pressure. More than 50 of the 106 NGOs included language in charter documents pledging loyalty to the CCP, with some acknowledging that they defer to the party on decisions of hiring and funding, the investigation found. Forty-six listed directors or others in leadership roles who simultaneously held positions in Chinese state agencies or the CCP. Records show that at least 10 received the bulk of their funding from Chinese government sources. […] The number of Chinese organizations with U.N. credentials has nearly doubled since 2018, the year of the initial U.N. report on Xinjiang. Many of these organizations were formed at least a decade ago but only sought NGO accreditation after 2018. The surge reflects an effort that has been backed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and involves nearly every level of government in China. […] Last year, 33 Chinese NGOs made nearly 300 appearances at Human Rights Council sessions, according to data gathered by the International Service for Human Rights (ISHR), an independent nonprofit group. An examination of their statements and testimony found not a single instance in which any had uttered words that could be construed as critical of China. [Source]\n\nEthnic minority groups are often targets of Beijing’s transnational repression, as the ICIJ highlighted. Alongside the investigation is a report by Citizen Lab detailing how Uyghur-language software was hijacked to deliver malware that was extremely well customized to reach the target population of Uyghurs in exile. The report states that the cyberattack replicates a pattern of Chinese-government-aligned threat actors digitally targeting marginalized communities. Earlier this month, CDT documented other reports on the expansion of China’s digital repression of Tibetans, including those in diaspora, via a Chinese state-owned digital forensics firm that provides offensive cyber-operations training for Lhasa’s Tibet Police College. The Guardian, another ICIJ partner, recently uncovered an online campaign of transnational repression against Hongkongers in the U.K. The campaign included 29 accounts that published over 150 posts last August doxxing Hongkongers and exhibiting similarities to other online influence operations by a Chinese security agency. ICIJ partners provided other local case studies, as well.\n\nAnother focus of the ICIJ investigation was the Chinese Party-state’s attempts to instrumentalize Interpol. The Chinese government has increasingly used Interpol red notices to target a wide range of its citizens abroad, and China “does not appear to be among the countries currently subject to Interpol corrected measures for alleged misuse of the organization’s system,” the ICIJ wrote. Along with other ICIJ partners, Simon Leplâtre at Le Monde described how Interpol is used as a tool in China’s arsenal of transnational repression, using the story of Huang Youlong (referred to as \"H.\"), a close confidant of Jack Ma:\n\nLike H., hundreds of individuals whom China considers to be persons of interest have been targeted by abusive red notices. In collaboration with 42 media outlets and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Le Monde investigated several cases that illustrate China’s use of Interpol and the lack of safeguards within the institution. Despite attempts to reform it, Interpol, based in the French city of Lyon, still lacks transparency in its procedures and never publicly holds countries that abuse it accountable – a boon for authoritarian regimes. Our investigation shows that Interpol is one of the components of China’s arsenal of repressive measures used against its targets abroad, whether they are political dissidents, members of minorities that are oppressed in China – such as Uyghurs or Tibetans – businesspeople and political leaders, either corrupt or the victims of purges. […] Ted Bromund, a researcher and expert witness in legal cases involving Interpol procedures, explained that \"Interpol is a tool. So is sending text messages to people. So is stalking them physically. So is revoking their passports. (…) By itself, it’s not generally particularly effective with China. But the way I like to put it with the Chinese is that Interpol is like a pin through a butterfly in an insect collection. It holds someone down, locks them in place so they can’t get away. And then it’s much easier to apply all of these other tools because you’ve got someone located.\" [Source]\n\nResponding to the ICIJ investigation on Bluesky, Jeremy Daum at China Law Translate shared a thread urging caution with the terminology and framing of the term “transnational repression” when contemplating appropriate responses to the phenomenon:"}

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nScientific knowledge expressed in articles is produced as machine-readable data in computing environments during the data analysis phase of the research lifecycle. Machine-readable scientific knowledge is deposited in a data repository as reborn data of the article and interlinked with the article in DOI metadata. Finally, to support reuse, e.g. for synthesis research, machine-readable scientific knowledge is collected and organized in aggregation systems, such as knowledge graphs.

DOI: 10.1038/s41597-025-04905-0. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04905-0\n\nDespite significant advances in digital technologies, modern scientific results are still communicated using antiquated methods. In nearly 400 years, scientific literature has progressed from physically printed articles to PDFs, but these electronic documents are still text-based and therefore not machine-readable. This means your computer cannot interpret the information they contain without human assistance.\n\nWith millions of scientific articles published annually, the need for machine-assisted information retrieval and processing is rapidly growing. Most efforts to address this need have attempted to train machines to interpret text-based information using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, usually with limited success.\n\nRecently, a research team from the TIB—Leibniz Information Center for Science and Technology proposed tackling the problem with a different mindset. Rather than trying to teach machines our language, why not produce science in a language they already understand?\n\nIn an article published in Scientific Data, the team introduces reborn articles, an open-source approach that allows researchers to produce scientific findings in a machine-readable format.\n\nDr. Markus Stocker, first author and head of the Lab Knowledge Infrastructures at the TIB, explained, \"Many scientists already use data analysis tools that produce results machines can read. But the standard way of publishing these results is to organize them in a PDF document that is not readable by machines. This means that if anyone wants to reuse these results, which is the entire point of publishing them, they first have to extract and restructure them.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be more efficient if we could publish results in a way that preserves their original structure? That's what reborn articles enables.\"\n\nHow reborn articles work\n\nThe reborn articles approach works with common data analysis tools like R and Python, and allows researchers to produce results that can be easily read by both humans and machines. This means other researchers can reproduce the analyses themselves and even download reborn article data as Excel or CSV files, which are also machine readable.\n\nThis may seem trivial, but the main alternatives for reusing published data are to either copy and paste individual values from PDF articles by hand, which is time-consuming and error-prone, or use AI-based tools, which are inaccurate.\n\nOvercoming the current fixation on AI-based information extraction has been a challenge when explaining how the approach works. As co-author and TIB postdoctoral researcher Dr. Lauren Snyder noted, \"AI-based extraction tools are a hot topic. It seems every field of science is looking for ways to use large language models and other extraction-related approaches. While they are powerful tools in certain situations, I wonder if fixating on them is not doing us an overall disservice.\n\n\"Imagine renovating your home and trying to tackle every job with drilling tools. That just doesn't make sense. I worry this fixation on information extraction will lead us to miss opportunities to develop tools that can tackle certain tasks more efficiently. I hope our work inspires others to start thinking beyond mainstream approaches.\"\n\nDr. Stocker added, \"People have been pointing out the inefficiencies of how we produce scientific knowledge for at least a quarter century. In that time, AI-based extraction has not solved the problem and if we continue with the mindset that extraction is all we can do, by mid-century we might still be struggling with the same problems.\n\n\"If instead we had begun using long-existing technologies to ensure scientific knowledge is produced and published machine readable, today we would have vast databases of organized knowledge.

Use these alternatives instead", "fullContent": "When was the last time you used a USB flash drive? I had to think for a moment myself — and to be honest, I can’t remember exactly. For years, the USB stick was the device of choice when it came to fast and uncomplicated data transfer. Why do these practical storage aids hardly play a role today, and are they possibly even on the verge of extinction? A look at current developments sheds some light on this.\n\nWhy are USB flash drives no longer popular?\n\nAs compact and handy as they are, USB sticks have lost much of their relevance in recent years. One of the main reasons is their comparatively low storage capacity. Many commercially available models end at 256GB or 512GB, which means that large amounts of data such as 4K videos, complete photo archives, or system backups can only be transported to a limited extent.\n\nAlthough there are also some high-end sticks with up to 2TB of memory, such as the Seagate Ultra Compact SSD, many people prefer to use an SSD for such capacities. The reason: SSDs generally use more powerful flash chips, which ensure higher data transfer rates and a longer service life.\n\nAnother problem: The classic USB-A connection is hardly suitable for modern devices. Most laptops and tablets rely on USB-C, as do smartphones.\n\nmentioned in this article Seagate Ultra Compact SSD Read our review Best Prices Today:\n\nAlthough there are now USB sticks with Type C connectors, such as the aforementioned Seagate Ultra Compact. There are also so-called dual sticks with USB-A and USB-C connections, but in practice this is often a compromise. Many of these models rely on simple controllers and cheaper flash memory, which results in significantly slower transfer rates — especially when writing large files.\n\nModern alternatives to USB flash drives\n\nExternal hard drives: Lots of storage for little money\n\nExternal hard drives, such as External drives, such as SSDs, are robust and powerful — with significantly more storage space than the average USB stick.\n\n\n\nExternal drives — whether classic HDDs or fast SSDs — are among the most popular alternatives to USB sticks. They offer significantly more storage (up to 4TB and more), and SSDs in particular impress with their high transfer speed via USB-C or Thunderbolt. While HDDs offer a lot of space at a favorable price, SSDs are the better choice for large amounts of data, as they are faster, more robust, and hardly more expensive in higher storage classes than comparable USB sticks.\n\nAdvantages: Significantly more storage space than USB sticks\n\nShock-resistant and durable, higher-quality flash chips\n\nIdeal for backups or large amounts of data Disadvantages: Larger and heavier than a USB stick\n\nSometimes more expensive, especially for SSD models Sandisk Extreme Portable SSD 1TB (portable NVMe SSD) External drive with SSD technology 2.5 inch, USB-C, up to 2,000 MB/s read and write, NVMe SSD, IP65, 5-year warranty buy it on amazon for $129.99 Mattias Inghe\n\n\n\nCrucial X10 Pro 1TB Portable SSD External drive with SSD technology, USB-C, up to 2,100MB/s read and 2,000MB/s write, IP55 buy it on amazon for $114.80\n\nJon L.

They are standard, especially for cameras, drones, and mobile devices, as well as some laptops. In combination with a USB-C card reader, SD cards can even be used as mini storage drives for notebooks. Further reading: SD cards, demystified: How to decipher the confusing jumble of specs The advantage over classic USB sticks: SD cards can be used more flexibly in many areas, are often cheaper per gigabyte and — depending on the class and model — also achieve high transfer speeds. They are also easy to replace or permanently integrate into devices, such as cameras or laptops with card readers. So if you work with memory cards anyway, you can easily use them as a mobile drive (and save yourself the extra stick).

Services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, or OneDrive offer storage space on the internet that you can access from any device — without a physical drive. Advantages: Access from anywhere with an internet connection\n\nIdeal for collaboration and shared files\n\nAutomatic synchronization possible Disadvantages: Dependent on a stable internet connection\n\nLimited free storage, followed by a paid subscription\n\nData protection and encryption are important issues\n\nConclusion: USB drive only for special cases?\n\nThe humble USB flash drive has not yet completely lost its place — it is quite common and ideal for simple data transfers, firmware updates, or as a boot stick. But as an everyday solution, it is long outdated. The combination of limited memory, decreasing compatibility, and growing requirements makes it a discontinued model. Modern alternatives such as SSDs, SD cards, or cloud services offer better performance, more flexibility and, in many cases, a better price-performance ratio."}

However, the Pro version is subscription-only which makes it very pricey over time. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nBest Prices Today: MSP360 Desktop Backup\n\nRetailer Price MSP360 $29.99 View Deal Product Price\n\nI checked out both the free and paid versions of MSP360 Desktop Backup for this review. Shockingly, the free version maintains enough of the paid version’s features to warrant a 4-star rating — even without support for consumer-grade online storage support that its Cloudberry Backup ancestor featured.\n\nMSP360 Desktop Backup Jon L. Jacobi\n\nConsider the free MSP360 Desktop Backup a nicely robust upgrade from Windows eminently useful File History.\n\nRead on to learn more, then see our roundup of the best Windows backup software for comparison.\n\nWhat are MSP360 Desktop Backup’s features?\n\nThe most salient difference between the free and paid versions of MSP360 Desktop Backup is the former’s lack of support for image backups. It also lacks encryption/compression, backup of virtual machines, support for Exchange, and other decidedly pro features. Like I said, think File History.\n\nBeyond that, a surprising amount of functionality is present and as far as I could tell, it’s not neutered at every turn as with a number of other freebies. There are full and incremental backups; scheduling that’s granular down to minutes; culling of backups (purging older backups, including grandfather/father/son options; as well as pre- and post- program execution).\n\nEven the free version of MSP360 offers extremely granular scheduling down to the minute.\n\nAlso on the feature list: NTFS options (permissions); file filters; a backup consistency check; email notifications; and a disaster recovery boot disk, albeit minus bare metal restore — i.e. the ability to restore to new, dissimilar hardware.\n\nBare metal restore is nice, but Windows includes generic drivers for everything basic these days, so the need isn’t nearly what it was back in the day when you might need to inject the Ethernet or Wi-Fi drivers to facilitate downloading all the other drivers.\n\nYou can even back up from, as well as to, network locations — if they’re already mounted as drive letters under Windows. Online storage may serve as a source as well. More on supported services in a bit. Whew! I did mention that this is the freebie, right?\n\nMSP360 Desktop’s file filtering options are extensive.\n\nMy biggest disappointment with MSP360 Desktop Backup, including the paid version, is that, unlike its Cloudberry Backup predecessor, online storage support is limited to prosumer/IT-oriented services such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon S3, S3-compatibles, Google cloud, etc. In other words, there’s no support for the Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, etc., that most of us use.\n\nOnly prosumer online storage services (and local destinations) are supported by MSP360 Desktop Backup.\n\nThat pretty much means that the freebie, when it comes to the average user, is good only for local storage and local network backup.\n\nI do have one or two other minor gripes. Numero uno, I wish there was support for non-proprietary container files such as VHD so that the program wasn’t required for restore operations.\n\nAlso, it would be nice to be able to define multiple destinations for each data set rather than having to create a new job for every destination. On the other hand, you can chain backup jobs for execution.\n\nThose are standard suggestions on my part for a lot of backup software and don’t really affect overall functionality — or the rating. Not much at least.\n\nMSP360 also offers a WinPE boot disk, though the disk produced by the free version is limited like the Windows version.\n\nHow much does MSP360 Desktop Backup cost?\n\nMSP360 Desktop Backup is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Obviously, the free version costs nothing, but the Standalone version with imaging will set you back $30 a year. There is no perpetual option — a bit of a bummer, as rarely do backup programs improve drastically in a year’s time. Blame that on their existing maturity. Are you listening, Acronis?\n\nThe Pro version of MSP360 Desktop with imaging is $30 yearly.\n\nIf you are interested in the paid-level features and online (remote) management of multiple computers, there’s also MSP360 Managed Backup for $2.50 per seat, per month, or $30 per seat yearly. However, storage is extra, with $72 yearly for 1TB Wasabi being the default. Alas, no consumer-grade online storage services are supported so you can’t leverage those.\n\nThat makes the Managed Backup version possibly the better deal than Desktop, but only if your storage service aligns.\n\nNote that restore functionality remains intact perpetually so you can always restore your backups if you drop your paid subscription. That’s essential if you’re using proprietary data containers as MSP360 does.\n\nHow does MSP360 Desktop Backup perform?\n\nI did my initial testing with the free version, and my only issue was self-inflicted — choosing a drive without enough free space to contain the backup. This forced an error. Hitting the restart button caused another error as the program tried to create an incremental backup.\n\nObviously, the program didn’t realize that the first job had failed. I reformatted the destination to free up enough space in the mean time, and choosing the “Force full backup” command solved that issue.\n\nAm I a bit hasty? Yes. I tend to rush testing in order to better spot possible weaknesses that might bite end users. You’d be surprised how often it works. That said, the program could be just a tad smarter about checking that there’s enough space on the destination, or that there’s a valid full backup before trying to create an incremental addition.\n\nWithout space-challenged destinations, MSP360 Desktop Backup proceeded through numerous jobs without issue.\n\nRestore functionality remains intact perpetually so you can always restore your backups if you drop your paid subscription.\n\nGreen bars at 100% are what we like to see with any backup program. Too much red and the rating plummets.\n\nThe company sent me a license for the paid version so I could test the imaging backup. I’m very happy to report that the imaging works quite well. The disaster recovery disk booted fine, and restore operations (image and file) went off without a hitch. Good on ya’, MSP360.\n\nShould you buy MS360 Desktop Backup?\n\nIf you need something more powerful than Windows File History for your file backups, then the free version of MS360 Desktop Backup is a no-brainer. However, it’s difficult to recommend the paid version, which is subscription software that’s not going to evolve significantly on a year-to-year basis.\n\nOn the other hand, the soon-to-be-reviewed, and like-priced MS360 Managed Backup might just be worth the expense if you need to monitor and control backup chores for several computers remotely."}

Creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino told IndieWire their goal was to capture the elite level of artistry performed at institutions like the New York City Ballet, and not just in tiny five-second snippets. There is a tremendous amount of dance in Season 1. In total, according to Amazon, there are 29 different ballets performed in the first eight episodes (a full list is at the bottom of this article), with staged performances lasting upwards of three minutes on screen.\n\nThe 29 ballets staged for Season 1 are a mix of the classics — similar to what is regularly performed at institutions like Lincoln Center — and original pieces, most of which are the work of fictional choreographer Tobias Bell (Gideon Glick) and were created by “Étoile” choreographer Marguerite Derricks.\n\nDerricks, producer Dhana Gilbert, production designer Bill Groom, and Sherman-Palladino took IndieWire inside the process of restaging the classics and creating Tobias’ cutting-edge originals.\n\nRestaging the Classics\n\nThe Palladinos are avid ballet-goers, and when writing “Étoile” they picked classic ballets based on the needs of their story. For example, in Episode 1, when introducing the character of Cheyenne Toussaint (Lou de Laâge), billed as the world’s most celebrated dancer, choreographer Kenneth MacMillan’s Royal Ballet production of Sergei Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet” was their one and only choice.\n\n“That is how Cheyenne the character would dance — that sort of free and powerful, and always in motion and never stopping,” said Sherman-Palladino of the selection of “Romeo and Juliet” for Episode 1. “The first time we really see her dance, that’s how we needed it to look. So, there’s only one piece like that. It’s brilliant.”\n\nCheyenne (Lou de Laâge) in ‘Étoile’ episode 1. Courtesy of Philippe Antonello for Amazon MGM Studios\n\nBut as producer Dhana Gilbert explained to IndieWire, every established ballet, such as MacMillan’s “Romeo and Juliet,” had to be licensed.\n\n“I had to go to MacMillan’s widow and bend the knee,” joked Sherman-Palladino. “There’s a lot of legacy, you have to do it right. They’re protecting art.”\n\nLicensing the classic ballets was only step one, as “protecting the art” came with multiple hoops for the “Étoile” team to jump through.\n\n“When we used an actual established ballet, like ‘Romeo and Juliet,’ we had to go through the process of getting a dance master to come in and work with our company. [Our dancers] would have to learn the dance under the tutelage of the dance master who’s in charge of ‘Romeo and Juliet,’” said Gilbert. “We would then have to fly in their production designer to actually oversee the build [of the set] and then we also have to bring in lighting designers to light the show the way that it would normally be done.”\n\nDerricks said each classic ballet required a deep historical dive, and in some cases, because the original choreographer had long since passed away, the Amazon series could have gotten away with recreating its own version without restrictions. But the ”Étoile” choreographer preferred to rely on the contribution of each ballet’s dance master.\n\n“There was so much for me to choreograph in Season I, when I looked at the originals, I was like, ‘Let’s let these classics stand,” said Derricks. “There’s so much dance in the show, and there’s such a nice variety that I wanted the classics to be shown the way they were originally choreographed.”\n\nWhile Gilbert indicated there was an extra layer of coordination (and time) required to balance the original ballet’s legacy keepers with each department head’s need to ensure the series’ look, production designer Bill Groom, like Derricks, embraced leaning into the established classic productions.\n\n“Early on I thought, ‘Well, if I can use existing ballet productions [sets] that would make sense just from a production and practical point of view,” said Groom. “‘La Bayadere’ was the first one that I was trying to figure out how to solve that problem, and I just sat down one day on the computer and typed in ‘La Bayadere production for rent’ and something popped up. It was in Tokyo, so we negotiated to rent that production, all of the backdrops, the side wings, and have it flown to Paris. It turns out it was a production from the Ukraine that had been sent to a ballet company in Tokyo for safekeeping during the war. It felt like an honor to be able to use that production.”\n\n‘Sylvia’ and ‘Bound To’\n\nWhile most of the established ballets were well-known classics written into the script by the Palladinos, and left untouched by Derricks, there were exceptions. For Mishi’s (Taïs Vinolo) dance solo in Episode 7, in which she holds a bow and arrow, Derricks recommended they adapt “Sylvia.”\n\n“The girls have been bullying Mishi for so long and when the curtain comes down, she gets this standing ovation, and she’s like, ‘In your face,’” said Derricks. “She finally has this moment to come out and I found this ballet, ‘Sylvia.’ It’s not danced as often as ‘Giselle’ and ‘Swan Lake,’ and it was the only [established] piece in our show that I did my version of it, wanting to make it right for the story.”\n\nChoreographer Marguerite Derricks on the set of ‘Étoile’ Courtesy of Philippe Antonello for Amazon MGM Studios\n\nBeyond the fictional Tobias, the other modern choreographer who makes an appearence in “Étoile” is the very real Christopher Wheeldon, who plays himself when the fictional company stages his “Bound To,” which captures the rekindling of Cheyenne’s relationship with Gael (David Alvarez), who she hand picks to be her new dance partner upon arriving in New York.\n\n“We’re huge fans of Christopher Wheeldon, so we used his ‘Bound To’ because it felt like the thing [Cheyenne] would pick Gael (David Alvarez) to be her partner,” said Sherman-Palladino. “It’s a whole partner piece, it’s a lot of trust, it’s a lot of lifts, a lot of close movements. It’s something that you need a partner that you really gel with to [execute], and that was the storyline that we were doing.”\n\n‘Piece 1’ and the Tobias Bell Originals\n\n“The hardest to create is what Tobias’s style would be, and that was something that Marguerite was working on very, very early on,” said Sherman-Palladino. “She’s been our secret weapon for a while — imaginative, smart and understands story, camera, and the whole process, and so this was a chance for her to create a whole style for a character, which would be key for the story.”\n\nTobias’ dance is an expression of his character, and so much of the Season 1 plot — including why anyone tolerates his unorthodox ways and process — was predicated on him being an exciting new voice in choreography. It was a challenge Derricks embraced, but she also felt a deep connection with the character.\n\n“Reading the scripts, he’s such a quirky dude, but so many of his quirks I embody,” said Derricks. “His having to have a certain pillow, I auditioned eight pillows in New York before I settled on one, so when I read that I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m the female Tobias.’” Derricks also spent a great deal of time with comedian Gideon Glick, who plays Bell and followed the “Étoile” choreographer around while she created dances and ran rehearsals. “I think Gideon got a kick outta me, I get a kick outta him, and we, together, have become Tobias.”\n\nFrom reading the script, Derricks saw Tobias’ choreography as edgier, at times weird, but also sexy. She wanted it to have a distinct jazz influence, the choreographer referring to Tobias’ work as “jazzerina.” Derricks also had spent two years steeped in the new generation of choreographers pushing ballet forward. While most articles about “Étoile” draw the direct parallel between Tobias and choreographer Justin Peck, an influence Derricks doesn’t deny, Peck is part of a larger movement she was trying to tap into with Tobias.\n\nTobias (Gideon Glick) in ‘Étoile’ Courtesy of Philippe Antonello for Amazon MGM Studios\n\n“Justin Peck is kind of the young, hot choreographer at New York City Ballet, but there’s some also European guys — just amazing, creative, out-the-box choreography out there,” said Derricks. “So, if I didn’t push the envelope with Tobias, I think I would be making a big mistake.”\n\nLocked In her Paris apartment for an extended Easter weekend break, Derricks listened to the same piece of music on repeat to dream up the choreography of what become Tobias’ “Piece One.” The image Derricks kept playing in her head was of how American dancer and choreographer Twyla Tharp once had her dancers sliding on their toes and knew she wanted to build ‘Piece One’ around that.\n\n“‘Piece One’ is just Incredible,” said Sherman-Palladino, indicating it was the moment the series started to come together. “It really says everything you need to know about Tobias and it allowed us to then, in scenes, talk about him as this sort of boy genius, and sort of this annoying person that everyone put up with because of what he can create and where he’s going.”\n\nOriginal dances choreographed by Derricks for Tobias Bell:\n\n“Piece 1”\n\n“Taiko”\n\n“Growing Pressure”\n\n“Piece 2”\n\n“Whatever This Is”\n\nOther Original work choreographed by Derricks:\n\n“Tobias Crossing Street”\n\n“Tarantella”\n\n“Big In Japan”\n\n“Finale”\n\n“Motivation”\n\nNicholas’ 1989 Ballet\n\nClassical Ballets recreated for Season 1:\n\n“Romeo and Juliet”\n\n“Don Quixote”\n\n“Sleeping Beauty” (two different pieces)\n\n“Coppelia”\n\n“Giselle”\n\n“Swan Lake” (both “White Swan” and “Black Swan”)\n\n“Le Corsaire”\n\n“La Bayadere”\n\n“The Nutcracker” (three different pieces)\n\n“Raymonda”\n\n“Sylvia”\n\n“Bound To”"}

The 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield on Sunday secured the Reds’ second Premier League title in five years and their 20th league title – matching Manchester United’s total.\n\nArne Slot became the first Dutch manager to win the Premier League, doing it in his debut season after replacing the iconic Jurgen Klopp last summer.\n\nFormer Man City defender Richard Dunne spoke exclusively to Anfield Index and gave plenty of credit to Liverpool for their historic campaign…\n\nLiverpool Have Been ‘By Far the Best Team in the League’\n\n“Sunday was a perfect afternoon for Liverpool,” began Dunne, “They performed brilliantly as they have all season long and they undoubtedly deserve the league title.”\n\n“They’ve been by far the best team in the Premier League,” continued Dunne, “Huge congratulations to them and the strength and depth that they should have means that they can be confident ahead of next season.”\n\nThe performance against Tottenham Hotspur was the perfect performance to symbolise Liverpool’s success this season. In fact, the Reds have now scored 15 goals against the same Tottenham Hotspur side across all competitions this season alone.\n\nWinning league titles aren’t easy regardless, but to do so with four games remaining and a 15-point lead at the top of the table speaks volumes of the brilliance of Slot’s side this season.\n\n“They Could Dominate for Years!” – Warns Dunne\n\n“Add a few players with real quality to this group of players and they could dominate for years,” warned Dunne.\n\n“It feels like it could take a few years for Manchester City to get back to their best, whilst Arsenal just don’t seem to be able to get anything over the line,” said Dunne, “Liverpool have the quality, the experience and the know-how to win the Premier League. They’re favourites for next season without a doubt.”\n\nAccording to reports, Liverpool are already working on deals to improve their squad this summer. As Darwin Nunez looks increasingly likely to leave this summer, the Reds will sign a new striker this summer with Newcastle United’s Alexander Isak and Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike at the top of that list.\n\nDefensive reinforcements are also expected, with AFC Bournemouth duo Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez both highly rated by sporting director Richard Hughes. A right-back could also be signed with Trent Alexander-Arnold still expected to join Real Madrid this summer.\n\nEither way, there will be unwavering support behind Arne Slot as he heads into his second season in charge of the Reds with the aim of winning a record-breaking 21st league title."}

It is deeper than just a memory. Memories are hazy, you know? This is different. This is colourful. It’s warm. Almost like a dream.” Alisson’s vivid recollections of childhood paint an extraordinary portrait of connection between father and son, a bond that football helped forge.\n\nWhen tragedy struck during Liverpool’s 2020-21 season, with the sudden loss of his father in Brazil, Alisson found himself oceans away, grappling with unimaginable grief in the midst of a pandemic. “All I remember was I felt so lost. It did not seem possible that someone like my father could actually be gone.”\n\nLiverpool’s Family Spirit\n\nThe true spirit of Liverpool shone through in the darkest hours. From flowers delivered by teammates to heartfelt letters from rivals like Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti, to Jürgen Klopp’s compassionate support — it was clear Alisson was more than just a player; he was family.\n\n“I’ll never forget, Jürgen called me, and I was feeling so guilty about missing training… But Jürgen told me to take as much time as I needed.” It was a profound reminder that football, at its best, is about humanity first.\n\nAlisson’s inability to attend his father’s funeral in person — choosing instead to protect his pregnant wife and children — showcased the resilience and selflessness instilled in him by the man he mourned.\n\nFrom Tears to Triumph\n\nThrough the weight of grief, football became a source of peace. The defining moment came when Alisson scored an extraordinary goal against West Brom — a header that not only kept Liverpool’s Champions League hopes alive but symbolised something greater.\n\n“I said, ‘Pai… pai…’ It’s for you, Dad!” Alisson looked to the heavens, his celebration drenched in emotion, light piercing the grey English sky.\n\nHis faith, a force quietly but deeply embedded in his life, provided him with comfort through unimaginable pain. “Until that day, I know one thing for sure: I never, ever walk alone.”\n\nFuture Rooted in Love\n\nToday, echoes of his father’s spirit fill Alisson’s home. His children’s laughter on the family carpet, games of ‘Taffarel saves’ played beneath the living room couch, keep the flame burning brightly. “Every time they come running, every time I lay down on the carpet and guard the goal with my hands, every time I pull my funny clown face, I can feel my father’s presence.”\n\nAlisson’s story is one not just of sporting achievement, but of life’s deeper meaning: memory, faith, family — and the healing power of love.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nAs Liverpool supporters, Alisson’s words strike directly at the heart. This is more than just the story of a world-class goalkeeper — it’s the story of a man who wears the Liverbird with a profound sense of pride and vulnerability.\n\nFans have always seen Alisson’s composure, his grace under pressure, but now, thanks to his candid reflections, we understand the depth of his strength. His choice to prioritise family, even in the face of unimaginable sorrow, reflects exactly what Liverpool Football Club represents: You’ll Never Walk Alone is not just a song; it’s a way of living.\n\nThat famous header against West Brom — a moment that brought fans to tears — now carries an even greater significance. It wasn’t simply about Champions League qualification. It was about carrying love and loss on your back, and still finding the strength to rise.\n\nAlisson’s story reminds us all why football matters — not for the trophies or the headlines, but for the community, the shared struggles, and the timeless bonds that tie us together."}

I’ve always had a deep passion for public policy, science, and the environment—whether it was learning about ecosystems or thinking about how policies could shape the world for the better. As I grew older, I pursued my interest academically, earning a bachelor’s degree in microbiology. Balancing my love for science with my growing interest in policy, I enrolled in a master’s program in environmental sciences, specializing in environmental policy. After graduating, I dove into work that sits right at the intersection of sustainability and energy. My goal has always been to contribute to solutions that promote clean and affordable energy while building a more sustainable world. Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of working across a variety of sectors—private, nonprofit, and international organizations, each of which has shaped my understanding of the complex challenges and opportunities in energy.\n\nWhat do you do in your current role at your company?\n\nIn my current role, I support global efforts to provide electricity to millions of people in developing countries that lack access to energy. Specifically, I provide technical guidance to ensure that clean energy investments are economically transformative and support good-paying jobs and livelihoods.\n\nCould you describe your typical day at work?\n\nMy work is always a mix of different tasks, and no two days are the same. At the heart of what I do is research, where I dive into various topics related to energy. This involves gathering data, identifying trends, and interpreting insights to help guide decision-making in a meaningful way. On some days, I’m focused on program management. This means keeping track of multiple projects, making sure everything is on track, liaising with partners to ensure smooth implementation, and writing progress reports to communicate updates to stakeholders.\n\nOther times, I shift gears into knowledge management. This could involve writing reports, creating content for knowledge products, or organizing workshops where people from different sectors can come together, share ideas, and collaborate on solutions. Every day brings something new, and I love the variety and challenge that comes with balancing all these different aspects of my role.\n\nChiagozie speaking at a workshop hosted by SustyVibes in Lagos\n\n\"The most rewarding part of my work is knowing that what I do helps make a real difference in communities..”\n\nWhat is the most fun thing you love about your work?\n\nThe most fun thing about my job is getting to meet and interact with like-minded professionals that are passionate about creating positive change in the world\n\nHow do you balance work and life?\n\nI make a conscious effort to maintain a healthy work-life balance, ensuring that I set aside time for myself outside of work.

The impact we’re driving isn’t just about big-picture goals; it’s about improving lives on the ground and making the world a better place for future generations. That sense of making a meaningful difference is what keeps me motivated every day.\n\nWhat would you consider a highlight of your career?\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve had many exciting moments, but one of the most consistent highlights is being invited to speak to students and young people about energy access and my personal journey. It’s incredibly fulfilling to share my experiences and insights with the next generation, especially when I see their enthusiasm and curiosity about the field. I always try to inspire them by showing how diverse and impactful a career in this field can be, and how they have the potential to shape the future. Whether it’s sharing the challenges I’ve faced, the lessons I’ve learned, or just offering practical advice, I find it energizing to connect with young people who are eager to make a difference.\n\nChiagozie at the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings in Washington, DC\n\n\"Being able to contribute to projects that tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges gives me a deep sense of purpose.\"\n\nWhat are you passionate about outside of work?\n\nOutside of work, I am passionate about playing sports, volunteering and fixing cars.\n\nChiagozie at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nHow do you think that your work makes a difference in the energy space?\n\nThe energy sector globally is evolving rapidly; therefore, I believe the work that I do in supporting strategic energy planning and delivering innovative projects that are both technically and economically feasible plays a crucial role in achieving a net zero future.\n\nWhat advice do you have for someone new to the industry?\n\n1. Stay informed. The energy sector is vast and constantly evolving, so take the time to understand the fundamentals of your area—whether it's renewable energy or energy policy. Learn the terminology, trends, and challenges shaping the industry. Stay curious and keep up with the latest developments. This knowledge will not only help you contribute meaningfully but also earn you credibility with your peers.\n\n2. Be confident. It’s normal to feel a bit out of your depth at first, but don’t let that hold you back. Trust in your ability to learn and adapt. Speak up, ask questions, and share your perspective when you can. Confidence doesn’t mean you need to have all the answers—it’s about being willing to engage and learn as you go.\n\n3. Network. Relationships are everything in this industry. Attend conferences, industry events, and webinars. Introduce yourself to people in the field, ask about their experiences, and listen to their advice. Networking isn’t just about exchanging business cards; it’s about building genuine connections that can support and guide you throughout your career. And remember, people love helping those who are enthusiastic and eager to learn!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this, do not hesitate to follow theenergy.africa\n\nSee you in the next article!"}

At the time I thought this story was greatly exaggerated, but today, an interview with Trump came out that changed everything.\n\nThe Back Story\n\nIn March 2025, the Trump administration began deporting alleged gang members—mostly Venezuelans accused of ties to the Tren de Aragua—to El Salvador’s high-security CECOT prison under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Despite a federal judge’s restraining order, the administration proceeded, arguing the order wasn’t enforceable. Many deportees had no U.S. criminal records, and a CBS investigation revealed only a small number had serious charges. The U.S. paid El Salvador $6 million to detain the individuals for a year, sparking backlash from human rights groups over due process violations and prison conditions.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia, a legally residing Salvadoran national in Maryland, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador’s high-security CECOT prison due to an administrative error by U.S. immigration authorities. Despite a 2019 court order granting him protection from deportation, the Trump administration alleged ties to MS-13, citing unverified claims. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled his deportation illegal and ordered his return, but the administration resisted, arguing judicial overreach.\n\nKnown Facts About Kilmar Abrego Garcia\n\nIn 2019, he was arrested in Maryland while seeking day labor work; authorities cited his attire and a confidential informant’s claim to suggest MS-13 gang affiliation. In 2022, he was pulled over in Tennessee driving a vehicle owned by a convicted human smuggler, transporting eight passengers without luggage, raising suspicions of human trafficking. Additionally, a 2021 domestic abuse complaint from his wife accused him of physical violence, though she later retracted the claims. Despite these incidents, Abrego Garcia has not been convicted of any crimes, and his family and legal representatives deny all allegations, asserting that he has no ties to criminal organizations.\n\nDoes Kilmar Abrego Garcia Have \"MS-13\" Tattooed On His Knuckles?\n\nOn April 19th, Trump posted an image on X of Garcia's knuckles with symbols below, and the text \"MS13\" Above. The color of the text matches the color of the tattoos below, leading many people to believe that someone Photoshopped the text onto the image to frame Garcia. This caused countless news organisations to write articles with controversial titles accusing Trump of lying about the tattoos and Garcia's gang affiliation.\n\nAs someone who uses Photoshop every day, I was very interested in this story, but after only a few moments of looking into it, the story appeared to be more anti-Trump \"fake news.\" Yes, the text was obviously added to the photo, but it wasn't necessarily nefarious; it was simply showing what the symbols below represent.\n\nAfter Trump released this photo, multiple photos of Garcia's tattoos were released and you can clearly see the text isn't there.\n\nDo the symbols on Garcia's knuckles actually represent \"MS-13?\" I've heard arguments from both sides, and to me it feels plausible, but unlikely.\n\nTrump Actually Believes The Photoshopped Text Is Real\n\nI was going to write a story about this weeks ago, but when I realized the added text was simply showing the meaning of the symbols, I decided there wasn't really a story. You can argue the validity of the interpretation of the tattoos, but there is no debate that the text above the symbols was added... Right?\n\nThis morning I saw an ABC interview with Trump that shocked me. Apparently Trump himself believes that the text added to the image was a real tattoo. The section on these tattoos begins at 20:00.\n\nThis revelation is such a strange turn of events. On one hand, nobody can blame Trump for doctoring the photo himself, because even he didn't know it was doctored. But how is this possible? Who gave him this photo, and how was its meaning not explained? Hopefully by now, someone has told him that the text was added to the image, and being that this appears to be the best evidence we have of Garcia's gang affiliation, will Trump change his opinion of Garcia's guilt?"}

It's crucial to understand production-quality data pipelines meant to \"handle\" terabytes of daily data generated by the enterprise's software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. The article takes you beyond the basic introductory stuff and on to more advanced techniques and best practices for developing scalable, fault-tolerant, and observable Airflow workflows.\n\nAdministration for an enterprise in a modern SaaS context is very challenging. It comes with a myriad of challenges in terms of monitoring, administration, and understanding the usage of applications across the organization. It involves the management of increasing amounts of unstructured data with a high tendency for real-time visibility under user activity, resource utilization, and compliance requirements. From this data, organizations need clear insights into usage within their applications to enable them to manage their human resources efficiently and optimally while being effective and compliant. Therefore, they need a powerful Admin Insights pipeline capable of:\n\nScaling out over many organizations and user bases;\n\nProcessing a vast amount of data in either real-time or near real-time; and\n\nProducing precise and personalized reports based on administrative needs.\n\nTo address these considerations, let's tackle a real-world scenario: building an Admin Insights pipeline for a typical SaaS application. Relatively in more abstract terms, at this point, we are going to be introducing Apache Airflow as the backbone of this reporting system, orchestrating large-scale ingestion, transformation, and automation of the data structures required.\n\nDesigning a Scalable Admin Insights Pipeline\n\nData flows from the SaaS Application to the Data Collection and Integration Engine (Segment) and then to the Data Warehouse (AWS Redshift). Report queries are run via Data Orchestration (Apache Airflow) on a periodic basis to dump pre-computed data into Data Lake (S3 buckets), which are subsequently accessed by API using AWS Athena.\n\n\n\n\n\nRobust building blocks comprise the modern data pipeline:\n\nSaaS application : It is the primary data-generating entity producing logs and events into application sessions and user activities.\n\n: It is the primary data-generating entity producing logs and events into application sessions and user activities. Data collection and integration : It is the very first stage in the data processing pipeline, usually requiring some analysis, and most often, relies on very popular tools like Segment.\n\n: It is the very first stage in the data processing pipeline, usually requiring some analysis, and most often, relies on very popular tools like Segment.

Query engine : Querying and obtaining insights is made possible using tools such as AWS Athena.\n\n: Querying and obtaining insights is made possible using tools such as AWS Athena. API: This finalizes the entire process by providing insights to the administrators through internal APIs.\n\nAdvanced Airflow Techniques for Admin Insights Pipelines\n\nTo boost scalability, automation, and security, the Admin Insights workflow uses these advanced Airflow methods:\n\n1. Dynamic DAG Generation: Custom Reports Per Enterprise Admin\n\nEnterprise Admins at different companies need different reports — some admins care most about keeping things secure, while others want to know how much people are using their product. A configuration database keeps track of what kind of reports each company wants. An Airflow job checks this database and uses Jinja templates to make DAGs that fit what each customer needs. This means every company gets reports made just for them without having to make separate DAGs by hand.\n\nFor example, when an enterprise admin asks for a report once a week, instead of every day, Airflow changes the schedule automatically without anyone having to do it.\n\n2. Custom Operators: Real-Time API Interactions\n\nAdmin Insights depends on the platform API data to monitor:\n\nActive users in each organization\n\nFeatures used most often\n\nTrends in license use\n\nRather than using generic operators, a custom Airflow operator works with the platform's API to get and handle admin-specific data. In this case, a FetchActivityDataOperator grabs user activity logs, changing them into an organized dataset for reports.\n\nPython class FetchActivityDataOperator(BaseOperator): def execute(self, context): response = requests.get(\"https://api.platform.com/admin_activity\", headers={\"Authorization\": \"Bearer token\"}) data = response.json() process_data(data) # Custom function to clean and store data\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Task Groups and SubDAGs: Modular Processing\n\nEnterprise reporting involves multiple layers — organization-wide, team-specific, and user-level insights. For keeping workflows modular, the pipeline uses Task Groups and SubDAGs rather than a monolithic DAG. By utilizing SubDAGs, we can have one SubDAG handle license utilization trends, while another focuses on user engagement metrics, making it easier to troubleshoot and scale.\n\nPython with TaskGroup(\"license_utilization\") as license_tasks: fetch_data = FetchActivityDataOperator(task_id=\"fetch_license_data\") transform_data = BashOperator(task_id=\"transform_license_data\", bash_command=\"dbt run --model license_trends\")\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Data Quality Checks: Ensuring Accuracy for Admin Reports\n\nSQL-based validations incur before publishing any reports.\n\nInfrastructure- activity not duplicated\n\nAligns between reports and admins' time zones.\n\nAll active users are fully accounted for.\n\nAll of the foregoing are processed and verified by an SqlSensor while a BranchPythonOperator will flag inconsistencies before such reports reach enterprise admins. We can easily build a pipeline that raises an alarm instead of inaccurate insights if empty fields exist in the report for an admin (e.g., missing active users).\n\nPython validate_data = SqlSensor( task_id=\"validate_admin_report\", conn_id=\"database_conn\", sql=\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reports WHERE report_status = 'Incomplete'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding both the technical and operational requirements of enterprise applications is crucial to building scalable and resilient data pipelines with Apache Airflow. The example of the Admin Insights pipeline serves to demonstrate how Airflow's ability for dynamic orchestration, modular task design, and custom operators can accommodate the specific needs for such applications in large organizations. By automating data ingestion, transformation, and reporting, it empowers administrators to get a truly real-time view into the user activity."}

Chesebrough, the inventor of Vaseline, ate a spoonful of petroleum jelly every day until he died at age 96, and once cured himself of pleurisy by having a nurse cover his body in Vaseline. Rating: About this rating Mixture What's True Shortly before petroleum jelly inventor Chesebrough died in 1933, at the age of 96, he publicly claimed to ingest \"more than a teaspoon\" of Vaseline daily. However … What's Undetermined We were unable to confirm the claim that he once cured himself of a case of pleurisy by having a nurse cover his body in Vaseline.\n\nFor years, internet users have shared a rumor that Robert A. Chesebrough, the chemist and inventor who founded the Vaseline brand, ate a spoonful of petroleum jelly every day until he died at age 96. Some posts also claimed that when Chesebrough was suffering from pleurisy, an inflammatory condition of the tissues that line the lungs and chest cavity, he ordered a nurse to cover his body in petroleum jelly, leading to his recovery.\n\nFor example, one 2024 Reddit post (archived) mentioning both parts of the claim received around 69,000 upvotes and 2,000 comments at the time of this writing.\n\nExamples of rumors about Chesebrough's unconventional uses of petroleum jelly also appeared on social media platforms including X (archived) and Facebook (archived), as well as in multiple other Reddit posts.\n\nIn short, there was evidence to support some — but not all — of the claim. In a letter the inventor wrote to the Spring Lake (New Jersey) Gazette six months before his death, Chesebrough, then 96, indeed attributed his longevity to eating Vaseline every day. The relevant section of the letter can be seen in the Newspapers.com clip below.\n\nHow a Market for Vaseline Was Created Article from Mar 2, 1933 Spring Lake Gazette (Spring Lake, New Jersey)\n\nIn it, Chesebrough wrote of Vaseline, \"I take more than a teaspoon daily and I believe I owe to it my approaching 97 years of age.\"\n\nAlthough Chesebrough's own words support the part of the claim concerning his daily ingestion of Vaseline, we have so far been unable to locate any primary or authoritative secondary sources corroborating the part of claim about Chesebrough allegedly treating a case of pleurisy by having a nurse cover his body in petroleum jelly.\n\nFor this reason, we rate the claim a mixture of true and unconfirmed information. We will update our rating if strong evidence for this second part of the claim surfaces.\n\nTracing the claims\n\nAs outlined on the official Vaseline website's \"Our History\" page, Chesebrough developed the idea for petroleum jelly, the generic name for the substance later marketed as Vaseline, when oil drilling began in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859. A chemist with previous experience producing kerosene from whale oil, Chesebrough took special interest in a byproduct of petroleum called rod wax, which Titusville oil workers had begun using as a salve for cuts and burns.\n\nIn 1865, Chesebrough filed the first of several patents for methods for purifying petroleum into petroleum jelly, which he began selling under the brand name Vaseline in 1870.\n\nThe earliest publication to contain the full claim investigated here was an article titled \"Mr. Chesebrough's Wonder Jelly,\" which was published in Coronet magazine in November 1953. Without any mention of how he found this information, the article's author, Mort Weisinger, wrote,\n\nSo great a faith did Robert Chesebrough have in the therapeutic value of his product that he swallowed a spoonful every day of his life. … In his late fifties, ill with pleurisy, he made his nurse anoint him with the substance from head to toe — and promptly recovered. Chesebrough died in 1933 at 96. On his deathbed, he boasted that he owed his longevity to his habit of taking a daily dose of the jelly.\n\nOver the following decades, these claims appeared in whole or in part in popular books, newspaper articles, blog posts, in \"Ripley's Believe It or Not,\" and even on the Britannica website. However, none of these appearances pointed readers toward an authoritative or primary source for the claim.\n\nThis was the case even for a mention of the claim that appeared in a 2017 issue of JAMA Dermatology, an academic journal published by the American Medical Association. In their citation for the claim, the authors of the piece pointed toward \"Panati's Extraordinary Origins of Ordinary Things,\" a book first published in 1987, which does include the claim but provides no source for it in the \"References\" section at the end of the book.\n\nSnopes was able to track down the newspaper article verifying the part of the claim concerning Chesebrough's daily consumption of Vaseline by scouring obituaries published after the inventor died in September 1933. One obituary, published in the Spring Lake Gazette, noted that Chesebrough, a Spring Lake resident at the time of his death, had \"frequently\" contributed articles and letters to that paper.\n\nA survey of Chesebrough's contributions to the Spring Lake Gazette turned up the aforementioned March 2, 1933, letter in which he both described his daily Vaseline ingestion and explicitly claimed he believed it was the source of his longevity. Chesebrough died in September of that year, several months after the letter was published.\n\nNone of Chesebrough's letters to this publication contained any mention of Chesebrough curing himself from an attack of pleurisy by having a nurse slather him in petroleum jelly, and as of this writing we have not been able to locate any other sources published during or soon after Chesebrough's lifetime that might corroborate this part of the claim."}

This marks the first time such technology will be produced entirely domestically. NVIDIA, known for reinventing computing, aims to leverage artificial intelligence and robotics to create state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in the U.S.\n\nHuang highlighted the significance of this technological leap, noting that the computer architecture has remained largely unchanged since the 1960s. He emphasized that the new NVIDIA processors, weighing 70 pounds and consisting of 60,000 parts, represent the next generation of computing. The complexity of these chips is such that their manufacturing and testing require advanced robotics and even a supercomputer, respectively.\n\nThe NVIDIA CEO credited President Trump’s leadership and policies for accelerating the pace of manufacturing in the U.S., stating that modern manufacturing is driven by technology rather than low-cost labor. Huang expressed gratitude for the administration’s support, which includes an industry-oriented energy policy essential for the growth of new industries like artificial intelligence.\n\nHuang conveyed that the support from the Trump administration is crucial for fostering the new AI industry, which he believes will revolutionize various sectors such as healthcare, financial services, and education. He stressed the importance of having the fundamental infrastructure for AI in the United States to enable innovation across these industries.\n\nThe partnership with the U.S. government signifies a major step for NVIDIA and the technology sector, with the potential to transform the landscape of artificial intelligence and manufacturing. The White House event served as a platform to underscore the collaborative effort between the administration and NVIDIA in shaping the future of AI and industry in America.\n\nRelated articles\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang discusses U.S. chip investment at White House event\n\nThese are the top 10 April stock purchases on Robinhood U.K.\n\nNVIDIA stock up as Meta boosts AI capex, Microsoft datacenter demand not slowing"}

Now the HAWC Collaboration has found evidence that TeV halos may be ubiquitous around middle-aged pulsars [2]. The result suggests that TeV observations could be used to find pulsars whose orientations render them invisible in other wave bands.\n\nPulsars are natural particle accelerators that convert the rotational energy of a spinning neutron star into the kinetic energy of relativistic particles. In a young pulsar, these particles (primarily electrons and positrons) are confined by the star’s strong magnetic field. But by the time the pulsar has reached middle age—at about 10,000 years―this field has declined enough for the particles to escape into interstellar space. Astrophysicists believe that TeV halos are produced around such pulsars because these escaped particles repeatedly scatter off ambient photons from stars and the cosmic microwave background, boosting the photons to TeV energies via inverse Compton scattering.\n\nThis result could help to settle a debate regarding the diffusion of pulsar-emitted particles. The sizes of the TeV halos suggest that the accelerated particles diffuse more slowly than they would in a typical region of the interstellar medium. When only a handful of TeV halos were known, this difference could be explained by regions of anomalous relativistic electron transport. But the possible ubiquity and uniformity of the halos indicate that the unexpectedly slow diffusion is due to a yet-unknown particle-transport phenomenon inherent to all middle-aged pulsars.\n\n–Marric Stephens\n\nMarric Stephens is a Corresponding Editor for Physics Magazine based in Bristol, UK.\n\nReferences et al., “Extended gamma-ray sources around pulsars constrain the origin of the positron flux at Earth,” A.

The enchanted structure made from buildings, round cannon turrets, fishlike fins, and a large rusty face complete with riveted tongue, all walking along on four spindly chicken legs, poses many challenges to any builder, but Sakiya Watanabe works magic and brings it to life in bricks like never before.\n\nWhen building something so iconic, choosing the right parts can be challenging, as there is nothing conventional about the outer surface of the castle. How do you form a cohesive model out of such a chaotic inspiration? (I’ve tried myself once before – it wasn’t easy!)\n\nThe organic curves of the castle’s surface are tricky to get right while still including plenty of attachment points for the little houses, gears, and pipes that cover the sides. Uncommon parts from the Galidor theme are used to great effect for chimneys, pipes, and those spindly chicken legs.\n\nThe builder shares a behind-the-scene peek at how those curved walls were created. The starring part here is the humble 1×2 plate with hole, stacked in alternating orientation, to create a gently-curved SNOT surface.\n\nIn this in-progress pic showing the lower portion of the castle you can see the eyes are made from a variety of round elements like wheels, gears, and rims.\n\nBut if you are wondering what that outer ring is, that comes from Ninjago spinner discs carefully deconstructed to remove this metallic element.\n\nOnce again, Sakiya Watanabe is at the vanguard of NPU, finding ways to recontextualize LEGO elements long forgotten by most. And the results are magic.\n\nRelated"}

Incentives include phased reductions in tariff offsets (3.75% of car value in Year One, dropping to 2.5% in Year Two).\n\nThe policy seeks to shift manufacturing to the U.S. by penalizing foreign automakers while offering transitional support for domestic parts sourcing. Trump’s broader goal: Reduce reliance on China and strengthen USMCA trade terms with Canada and Mexico.\n\nDemocrats, including Rep. Shri Thanedar, criticized the plan as executive overreach, filing impeachment articles. Critics warn of inflation risks and constitutional challenges, while the White House dismisses these concerns.\n\nAnalysts fear price hikes (up to $6,000 per vehicle) and potential retaliation from trade partners, similar to past tariff conflicts (e.g., 2018 steel levies). Skepticism remains over how quickly automakers can reshore production given global supply chain complexities.\n\nThe policy is a high-stakes gamble: aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing but risks trade wars, inflation and political strife. Success depends on automakers’ ability to quickly localize supply chains, a challenge exacerbated by bipartisan opposition and logistical hurdles.\n\nIn a bid to balance trade protectionism with bipartisan criticism, President Donald Trump’s administration unveiled a phased tariff relief plan on Tuesday aimed at reviving domestic auto manufacturing while easing immediate financial pressure on automakers. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick outlined terms requiring foreign automakers to use at least 85% domestic content in U.S.-assembled vehicles to qualify for tariff exceptions, with gradual reductions in foreign parts reimbursements over two years. The policy shift, announced as Trump approaches his first 100 days in his second term, seeks to fulfill campaign pledges to reshore supply chains away from China, even as critics warn of inflationary risks and constitutional challenges. With a Michigan rally scheduled for later Tuesday and Democratic impeachment articles filed by Representative Shri Thanedar, the move underscores the fraught political landscape of Trump’s trade strategy.\n\nPolicy details: Tariff relief for U.S.-built cars, but stricter rules for foreign automakers\n\nLutnick’s announcement clarifies that tariffs will apply to foreign automakers producing vehicles in the U.S., while also offering phased incentives to transition to fully domestic parts sourcing. The Commerce Department mandates that U.S.-assembled cars must include 85% domestic or USMCA-compliant content to avoid tariffs in the first year, which rises to 90% in the second year. Foreign automakers will receive offsets equivalent to 3.75% of a car’s value in the first year (reducing to 2.5% in Year Two) to counteract tariffs on imported parts.\n\n“This deal rewards companies manufacturing domestically while giving automakers runway to shift supply chains,” Lutnick told the Wall Street Journal, emphasizing the policy’s dual goals: shielding U.S. industries and pressuring allies like Canada and Mexico to respect bilateral trade terms. Ford CEO Jim Farley praised the plan as a “mitigation step,” though analysts like Morgan Stanley warned of potential $6,000 price hikes per vehicle.\n\nPolitical context: Trade strategy sparks Democrat backlash and inflation fears\n\nThe tariff adjustments come amid intensifying partisan conflict and economic uncertainty. Less than 24 hours after the policy’s unveiling, Michigan Democratic Representative Shri Thanedar filed impeachment articles accusing Trump of undermining democracy through executive overreach. Thanedar’s move follows years of Democratic accusations that Trump’s tariffs destabilize consumer markets—a charge the White House disputes.\n\nLutnick, a vocal tariff advocate, argued earlier this year during Senate confirmation hearings that tariffs are essential to “redress trade imbalances,” dismissing inflation concerns as “nonsense.” Yet the administration’s approach risks angering global trading partners and further inflaming supply chain bottlenecks. Meanwhile, auto executives have privately acknowledged that reshoring parts manufacturing—a core Trump goal—could take years, raising doubts about the plan’s short-term efficacy.\n\nEconomic implications: Trade-offs between manufacturing revival and rising costs\n\nCritics argue the tariffs’ real-world impact mirrors historical trade policy pitfalls. Past U.S. protectionism, such as 1930s Smoot-Hawley tariffs during the Great Depression, backfired by worsening global economic isolation. Similarly, Trump’s 2018 steel and aluminum levies sparked retaliatory measures from Canada and the EU.\n\nThe current plan seeks to avoid similar backlash by exempting USMCA-compliant goods and offering flexibility. However, a retroactive rebate mechanism for earlier tariffs—which would reimburse automakers for duties paid since March—remains logistically and financially unclear. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the offsets a “path to domestic job creation,” but the 25% China-related tariffs Trump retains could still stifle global trade.\n\nTariffs as a double-edged sword for Trump’s economic vision\n\nAs Trump pivots to reshoring supply chains ahead of his 100-day rally in Michigan, his auto tariff adjustments highlight both ambition and risk. The strategy aims to fulfill pledges on manufacturing revival and national security, but its success hinges on automakers’ ability to swiftly localize production—a challenge exacerbated by globalized supply networks. With Democrats poised to frame the tariffs as economically reckless and legally overreaching, the administration faces a precarious balancing act: maintaining voter support through short-term industry boosts while navigating prolonged trade wars. For now, the policy remains a gamble on reshaping U.S. industry—one fraught with partisan fissures and unresolved economic uncertainties.\n\nFollow-up reporting will explore grassroots reactions to auto price hikes and geopolitical fallout from European trade partners.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nZeroHedge.com\n\nWSJ.com\n\nBloomberg.com"}

Nature 641, no. 8061 (April 28, 2025): 31-33.\n\nThis is a review of the following three books:\n\nProto: How One Ancient Language Went Global\n\nLaura Spinney (William Collins 2025)\n\nThe Indo-Europeans Rediscovered: How a Scientific Revolution is Rewriting their Story\n\nJ. P. Mallory (Thames & Hudson 2025)\n\nRare Tongues: The Secret Stories of HiddenLanguages\n\nLorna Gibb (Atlantic 2025)\n\nRobinson begins:\n\nA key human characteristic is our complex languages — about 7,000 of which are spoken around the world today. Understanding the origin and development of past and present languages\n\ncan help researchers to understand human evolution.\n\nAlthough today’s languages group into about 140 families, only 5 of these families are widely used: Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Niger–Congo, Afro-Asiatic and Austronesian. Indo-European languages form the largest family, if those who speak them as a second language are included — with 12 main branches ranging historically from northwestern China to western Europe. “Almost every second person on Earth speaks Indo-European”, notes science writer Laura Spinney in Proto, one of a trio of intriguing books exploring the history of languages, common and rare.\n\nBoth Spinney’s lively book for non-specialists, and The Indo-Europeans Rediscovered — an academic study with broad appeal by archaeologist James Mallory — focus on the origins of this vast language family. By contrast, extinct and endangered languages are the preoccupation of Rare Tongues, a quirky study by linguist Lorna Gibb, aimed at all audiences.\n\nNot all Indo-European (IE) languages that have ever existed have survived until today. Two that are very consequential, because they are the first two known by name to have emerged from the IE progenitor — Hittite and Tocharian — went extinct millennia ago.\n\nHittite was mentioned in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament, and lasted from approximately 1700 BC to 1180 BC. They had a written language, inscribed on thousands (est. 30,000) of cuneiform tablets. Among their texts was a horse-training manual associated with the people of the land of Mitanni that included techniques and knowledge from Old Indo-Aryan. Whenever you see a pair of lion sculptures standing outside a bank, a government office, or other important building, bear in mind this art-architectural feature is carrying on a tradition from the Hittite capital of Hattusa.\n\nAs for Tocharian, although attested by only a small number of mostly fragmetary manuscripts, it has especially great significance for me personally, since evidence for its existence comes from archeological sites in the Tarim Basin (East Central Asia) where I worked for decades. We have had many posts about Tocharian people, language, and culture on Language Log and articles in Sino-Platonic Papers, one of the most important (\"The Problem of Tocharian Origins: An Archaeological Perspective\", SPP, 259 [Nov. 2015]) being by J. P. Mallory, who also co-wrote (with VHM) another book from Thames and Hudson, The Tarim Mummies: Ancient China and the Mystery of the Earliest Peoples from the West (2000), and in whose honor this festschrift recently appeared: Victor H. Mair, ed., Tocharica et archaeologica (Journal of Indo-European Studies Monograph Series No. 69 [2024]).\n\nFollowing Robinson through his entertaining, edifying survey of the trio of tomes he has chosen to review, we come upon a host of fascinating topics. Take Mallory's appendix, for instance, which lists 176 individuals who, between 1686 and 2024, each proposed homelands, for Indo-European — “as far north as the polar regions and as far south as Antarctica, from the Atlantic to the Pacific”. Next comes the well-known story of William \"Oriental\" Jones' semi-official discovery of the Indo-European language family. Then it's off to the races, following the traces of the Indo-Europeans every which direction.\n\nAlong the way, we learn that it was physicist Thomas Young who proposed the name \"Indo-European\" for the emerging family, while helping to decipher the Rosetta Stone. The Indus Valley civilization, which we have discussed for its mysterious, undeciphered script on several occasions here at recently, was a specious factor in the naming of the IE family.\n\nThe trail of the search for the homeland then shifts north to the Pontic-Caspian steppe. Beginning around 2015, the Yamnaya Culture (ca. 5300-4600 years ago) of that region, which had already been proposed as the IE homeland on archeological grounds, received support from genetics studies. Synthesizing the research of Spinney and Mallory, Robinson concludes that \"language played a more influential part in the evolution of human societies than did nationalism, empires and wars.\"\n\nThe reviewer next turns his attention to the opposite side of the coin, the reasons why some languages become extinct while others thrive, which is the focus of Gibb's Rare Tongues. The stories she tells of how political decisions were made, for example, in Namibia, that proved inimical to the native language of Oahiwambo, which is spoken by half of the population, in favor of English, which has official status, though spoken by less than 5% of the population.\n\nThe same kinds of problems endanger languages in many other parts of the world:\n\nIn Australia, for example, 93% of Indigenous languages are extinct or soon might be. And in India, 600 languages are endangered, partly because English has become a dominant language; 14 years ago, only 196 were, according to the UN cultural organization UNESCO.\n\nGibb then moves on to the subject of whistled languages:\n\nAmazingly, these exist on all inhabited continents. They arise from the fact, Gibb notes, that “full sentences in whistled speech are intelligible over distances ten times greater than if you were shouting”. This is possible because, unlike shouting, whistling does not strain the vocal cords and permits powerful volumes over a narrow range of frequencies.\n\nAnother subject that is dear to my heart is that of Manchu:\n\nSome languages nearing extinction have been revived. Manchu, an imperial language in China from 1644 to 1912, is now taught at universities across the country. Māori was made an official language of New Zealand in 1987 and is taught in schools. And Gaelic, promoted to an official language in Scotland in 2005, now appears alongside English on Scottish road signs.\n\nLanguages can be preserved, but you have to work at it. Languages do not preserve themselves. The people who speak them keep languages alive.\n\nTogether, these books capture the amazing complexity of languages worldwide, from many contrasting perspectives — including linguistics, archaeology, genetics and anthropology. However, readers must not expect to obtain a settled answer to the long-debated origin of Indo European languages. As a frustrated Mallory jokingly warns: “solving the homeland problem is the academic equivalent of herding cats”.\n\nTypical J. P. Mallory humor. Superlative!\n\nSelected reading\n\n[h.t.

Readers who have taken note of the performance of DeepSeek AI or other Chinese technical feats, like their super cheap EVs, dark factories, number of patents issued would not be surprised to learn that the US is lagging China. This Tom Neuburger post provides some details.\n\nBy Thomas Neuburger. Originally published at God’s Spies\n\nIt’s not difficult today to find articles on China’s great leaps forward in high tech development, and indeed, in development of all kinds. Ian Welsh, for example, has been ringing this bell for a while. A good example is here:\n\nForget GDP, it’s completely misleading. China is ahead in everything that matters: 80%+ of tech fields, has more population and the largest industrial base in the world and it’s the main trade partner of more nations than anyone else, including America. This graphic is illustrative, but it applies to everything except planes and launch capacity, and soon it will apply to them too[.]\n\nThe graphic referred to is sobering:\n\nFor more of Welsh’s China reflections, go here.\n\nChina and Tech Innovation\n\nBut one story in particular struck me as beyond remarkable:\n\nWorld’s fastest memory writes 25 billion bits per sec, 10,000× faster than current tech PoX could be the key to unlocking performance bottlenecks caused by storage limitations in AI hardware A research team at Fudan University has built the fastest semiconductor storage device ever reported, a non‑volatile flash memory dubbed “PoX” that programs a single bit in 400 picoseconds (0.0000000004 s) — roughly 25 billion operations per second. The result, published today in Nature, pushes non‑volatile memory to a speed domain previously reserved for the quickest volatile memories and sets a benchmark for data‑hungry AI hardware.\n\nI’ll spare you the jargon. Non-volatile flash memory is memory that persists when the power is turned off. It’s the BIOS at the core of your laptop, the flash drive the size of your thumb. As you know, writing to flash drives is slow. What the Chinese have done, is, with new technology, increased the write speed by a factor of 10,000.\n\nNotice the use of “graphene,” by the way, in the design of this product. Graphene is a miraculous and under-used substance — under-used because its use involves great technical difficulties. But the promise is great, as the above report shows. China is not alone in graphene development, but they’re at the head of the pack.\n\nThis is an artist’s representation, but accurate. It’s truly two-dimensional:"}
