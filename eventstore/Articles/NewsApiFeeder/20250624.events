More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the latest stock market chart of the company in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on May 25, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)\nNote: Costco FY�24 concluded on September 1, 2024.\nCostco�s (NASDAQ: COST) shares have experienced significant growth, increasing by 40% in 2024 (calendar year) and tacking on another 7% so far in 2025, easily surpassing the S\u0026P 500�s 2% increase. What�s fueling this momentum? Robust performance supported by its membership model. In fiscal Q3 2025 (which ended on May 11), Costco generated $63.2 billion in revenue and $2.5 billion in operating profit. Of that amount, $1.2 billion was derived from membership fees alone�accounting for nearly half of the operating profit, and primarily recurring. With inflation putting pressure on household budgets, Costco�s value-oriented model is resonating well with consumers. In May 2025, sales experienced a year-over-year increase of 7%�more than twice the 3% growth across the broader U.S. retail industry.\nAt first glance, it seems like a retail paradise.\nHowever, here�s the drawback: Costco is trading at 55 times earnings and 59 times free cash flow, resulting in a meager 1.7% cash flow yield. For perspective, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which enjoys faster top-line growth and exposure to high-margin sectors like cloud and advertising, trades at a lower multiple. While Costco may claim scale, strategic position, and market affection, it comes at a hefty cost. Refer to Buy or Sell Costco Stock?\nCostco�s valuation assumes perfection, and even a minor deceleration could lead to turbulence. To put it in perspective, this stock is not immune to volatility. Shares plummeted nearly 49% during the 2008 financial crisis, 20% during the Covid-19 crisis in early 2020, and 32% during the inflation-driven pullback of 2022. Investors should remain aware of that history, even as the current fundamentals appear strong.\nCostco�s high valuation is based on its consistently strong performance. In fiscal Q3 2025, the company achieved earnings per share of $4.28, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase, on $63.21 billion in revenue, an 8% rise. Comparable-store sales increased by 8% year-over-year, while e-commerce grew by nearly 15%, excluding fuel and currency impacts. Membership renewal rates remained exceptional, at 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada, and 90.2% globally, with total household memberships rising by 6.6%.\nIn the latest quarter, Costco�s U.S. same-store sales surpassed Walmart�s (NYSE: WMT) 4.5% and significantly outperformed Target�s (NYSE: TGT) 3.8% decline, highlighting the warehouse model�s attractiveness to value-oriented shoppers. The company�s high-margin, recurring membership revenue has shown remarkable resilience during economic hardships, contributing to the stock�s recent surge.\nOperating 905 warehouses worldwide, including 624 in the U.S., Costco leverages its pricing advantage through extremely thin margins and the efficacy of its private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. In Q3, shopping frequency increased by 5.2%, while the average transaction size only rose by 0.4%, showing that foot traffic�not price inflation�is driving the growth.\nCostco�s adaptable supply chain has allowed it to manage increasing tariffs by redirecting shipments and altering sourcing strategies. With two-thirds of its merchandise sourced domestically and merely 8% of U.S. sales connected to China, its exposure to trade risks is limited. The company is also localizing Kirkland production and experiencing steady demand for essentials such as groceries and fuel. Its scale enhances pricing power, which is vital for maintaining its premium valuation.\nCostco continues to be a premier operator, but its high valuation seems detached from its fundamentals. Revenue growth is solid, yet not explosive, lingering in the low teens. Store expansion has slowed�less than 3% for this fiscal year�and some new locations may eat into existing sales, indicating a maturing presence. The current premium assumes that elevated growth will persist. If comparable sales trend towards mid-single digits, investor confidence�and Costco�s valuation multiple�could come under pressure.\nInvesting in a single stock carries inherent risks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S\u0026P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in less volatile performance as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."}

They’re Safer Than Ever","fullContent":"ByMichael Foster\n\nByMichael Foster,\n Contributor. \nHundred Dollar Bill Being Cut With a Scissor\nIf you invest for long enough, you may hear a skeptic of high-yield investments�such as 8%+ yielding closed-end funds�say something like:\n�Sure, you�re getting a lot of income now, but what if that dividend gets cut?�\nToday we�re going to answer that with a look at how a dividend cut can actually send a CEF (or any dividend investment, really) on a profitable run. We�ll do it by looking at three CEFs that followed this exact pattern: Cutting dividends and then going on to give investors huge returns for years and years.\nThese funds show that a dividend cut on its own isn�t reason enough to avoid an investment. It could, in fact, be a buy signal.\nLet�s start with the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), which yields 8.2% as I write this and trades at a 7.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Put another way, the fund�s portfolio is valued at just over 92 cents on the dollar.\nThat portfolio consists of a basket of large- and mid-cap stocks, with holdings like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) alongside firms such as property manager FirstService (FSV) and Ollie�s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), which runs a chain of discount stores.\nThe fund uses an approach to dividends that a handful of other CEFs also follow: It commits to paying 8% of its NAV in payouts each year (in ASG�s case through four quarterly installments). That means that the dividend does tend to float, and the latest one is about 17% below where it was a decade or so ago.\nNow in light of that policy, this dividend �cut� is a little different than one we might see at a fund with a fixed payout, like the two we�ll examine next. But regardless, ASG�s lower payout might cause some investors to pass on the fund.\nThat�s too bad for them, since ASG has delivered plenty of special dividends in the last decade (the spikes in the chart above), culminating in a 162% total return (with price gains and reinvested dividends).\nDid ASG�s payout technically decline? Yes. But that strong total return more than makes up for it, proving that the lower payout is a poor reason to avoid this well-run CEF.\nOur next fund yields well into the double digits: the 13.6%-yielding BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX). As the name says, BTX holds well-known tech stocks like NVIDIA, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). It also holds a collection of private-equity investments.\nWe added BTX to my CEF Insider service in our April 2025 issue. But before then we avoided it, partly because its IPO was in 2021, when many tech firms, and many of the PE investments BTX�s former management team purchased, were overvalued. BTX, which replaced its managers at the end of January, has only recently traded at what I would consider a buyable price.\nWe�ve been more than happy that we were patient! In less than two months since our buy call, BTX has returned 16%, as of this writing.\nEven with its recent dividend cut (more on that in a moment), BTX�s current yield still translates to more than $11,000 per month on every $1 million invested. But you could easily miss this if you just looked at its dividend history.\nBTX Dividend\nOf course, a 19.3% decline in the last five years jumps out, and that gentle slide lower at the right side of the chart also looks like it could be a warning sign.\nLet�s take the second point first: That slide is due to the fact that the fund�s previous management team overdid it on their last dividend hike. The new team is gradually adjusting lower. That�s not a reason to worry.\nMeantime, a major reason why BTX�s yield so high is that the fund remains underpriced, even after its recent run (as yields and share prices move in opposite directions). As you can see above, at the start of the year, it traded at a double-digit discount that has since narrowed to around 2%. That�s a major reason for the 16% total return we�ve realized from this fund at CEF Insider.\nSo, even if BTX�s 13.6% yield is at risk of moving lower, investors who�ve bought the fund are still doing fine, thanks to the stock-price appreciation they�ve realized. (And of course, the huge income stream, which remains so even with a decline.)\nIn other words, a continued gradual drift lower in the payout is fine, as long as BTX�s portfolio keeps rising. We�ve seen that happen consistently over the last couple of months, and I expect it to continue as the fund�s discount moves closer to becoming a premium.\nFinally, let�s consider another �cutter� that�s (now) delivering consistent income: the Pioneer High Income Fund (PHT), which holds high-yield corporate bonds.\nPHT�s portfolio has been appreciating, despite volatile markets, as the Fed postponed rate cuts. The longer the central bank holds off, the more high-yield, longer-duration bonds PHT can buy (these bonds become more valuable as interest rates decline).\nPHT has had a 15.6% annualized return over the last three years, as of this writing, as it recovered from the 2022 selloff. And look at what the dividend did in that time:\nPHT Dividend\nThat 12% payout cut happened while PHT was delivering those same strong returns. Sure, the dividend�current yield 8.2%�made up a smaller part of PHT�s 15.6% annualized return due to the cuts, but capital gains more than made up the difference. In a situation like that, does the lower dividend really matter?\nLook at it this way: Every dollar put into PHT three years ago now earns a 9.6% yield on an investor�s original cost. And on the price front, every dollar is now worth $1.17.\nThese funds are just three examples of how dividend cuts are only one part of the story when looking at high-yield investments like CEFs�and how they can actually spark a turnaround in an investment�s performance. That said, it�s also true that you can�t just put all of your money in one CEF and rely on that payout for the rest of your life.\nBut it is possible to tap a strong income stream and, with just a bit of elbow grease, rebalance your portfolio every now and then to secure that income stream. And, of course, capital gains are also on the table to grow your portfolio in the long run.\nMichael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.
