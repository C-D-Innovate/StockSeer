It's a fully automated news site that publishes original, fact-based reporting each day. It has been a fun, eye-opening side project.\n\nWhy I Built It\n\nI've long been thinking about the challenges and pressures on traditional media. Social media has siphoned off ad revenue, leading to layoffs and closures. To survive, news outlets have often resorted to click-bait and polarization.\n\nI started to wonder: could I build a news site where every step was performed by AI? More importantly, could it be useful and credible?\n\nThe goal was neutral, factual reporting, grounded in real-world sources: government releases, legal rulings, financial reports, etc. No persuasion, just clean summaries of what actually happened.\n\nThe Pipeline\n\nThe system runs automatically every day via cron jobs. It creates:\n\n~22 articles/day on weekdays\n\n~12/day on weekends\n\nThe process is:\n\nScan for leads — pull from structured feeds and recent news headlines Score/rank leads — recency, quality, newsworthiness, novelty Select top candidates Do background research via AI + search Write an article Self-critique and revise Format, tag, and publish\n\nEach article costs around $0.25–0.30 in API usage. That adds up, but it's scalable in both directions. If the site gains traction, I can expand it. If not, I can scale it down without much pain.\n\nManaging LLM Behavior\n\nLLMs are capable, but prone to distraction and unexpected behavior. Here are some challenges I encountered:\n\nIf I asked the model to rate a lead on a series of metrics like recency, newsworthiness, and redundancy, it would sometimes \"reward\" redundancy just because it's a high score. I would have to normalize the direction of each metric.\n\nIf I combined too many tasks into one prompt (e.g. \"rate the leads and write an article about the best one\"), it would leak details between them. Articles would contain bits from unrelated leads.\n\nSimilarly, if I asked it to rate the 'recency' of events being considered and only select recent events, it would hallucinate incorrect recent dates for events to defend its own decision.\n\nBeing too explicit often backfires. Simpler prompts often worked better than elaborate, rule-filled ones.\n\nIn general, LLMs seemed to respond better to positive requirements than negative ones.\n\nWhen I asked it to write in AP-style, it presented itself as the associated press. Careful prompt tweaking is required to fix issues like this.\n\nIf I could explain what I wanted clearly enough, often the LLM could write a better prompt for itself.\n\nTo manage these issues, I split everything into clean stages with hard isolation between steps. Prompts are concise and focused. Unnecessary data is stripped between phases.\n\nI also relied on OpenAI’s function calling APIs, which were helpful in constraining responses to structured data and avoiding format drift.\n\nBrave Search: Better Than Expected\n\nThough I started with only OpenAI's search-preview API for research, I've also been experimenting with Brave Search for parts of the pipeline. It’s surprisingly easy to plug into a lightweight RAG system, and have the model cite recent headlines or summaries.\n\nUsing a custom search-enabled RAG system allows for more flexibility, and is cheaper than using the search-preview models.\n\nThe Stack\n\nBackend : Flask, SQLite, cron jobs and python scripts, prompts generated from Jinja2 templates\n\n: Flask, SQLite, cron jobs and python scripts, prompts generated from Jinja2 templates Metrics : Umami\n\n: Umami Frontend : Static HTML and Jinja2 templates\n\n: Static HTML and Jinja2 templates Icons : All generated by ChatGPT\n\n: All generated by ChatGPT Deployment: EC2 with Nginx and gunicorn\n\nIt’s not fancy, but with help from ChatGPT, I was able to build a complete site from scratch in about 2–3 weeks of evenings and weekends, completely solo - built entirely in my free time, outside of work.\n\nI didn't use IDE-integrated AI-assistants - my workflow was just to copy/paste code to and from a chat window and edit myself.\n\nI chose SQLite because it's easy to manage. It's not optimized for write-heavy workloads, but this is a read-heavy application. Flask is simple, and I've always liked Jinja2-style templating.\n\nWithout AI, I would have spent months just on the frontend and design alone. AI doesn't replace me as a software engineer, but the productivity boost is massive. I also never would have been able to create the icons and images on my own.\n\nCost and Scale\n\nRight now, I’m spending over $100/month just on API calls for a site that might be useful, or might be something only I read. It's a price I'm willing to pay for a hobby project for now, and I can always scale down if needed.\n\nCustom thumbnails would cost extra ~$0.04/article, so for now I'm just using static images by \"section.\" Posting to Twitter via API would cost another $100/month, so for now automatic posts only go to Bluesky.\n\nThere's plenty I could do to improve the quality of articles with higher spend too -- increasing the depth of research it does for each article, evaluating a broader set of leads, more iterations of revision, etc.\n\nWhat I'm Still Figuring Out\n\nI want to add features like:\n\nArticle upvotes or reactions\n\nComment threads (and spam filtering)\n\nHighlight-to-comment functionality\n\nBasic analytics beyond Umami\n\nEmail subscriptions\n\nBetter customization of article-generation pipelines per-section\n\nBut I'm taking it slow and balancing other time commitments. Comments and voting introduce a lot of architectural complexity and moderation overhead. They would also need a database better suited to write-heavy workloads. For now, I’m watching traffic patterns, improving content quality, and adding structure like tags and search.\n\nMore importantly, I want to improve the quality of the content. To do so, I need a way to get feedback, and that's where I need your input.\n\nImplications for Journalism\n\nAgentic Tribune can't replace journalism — it can only report on what has already been made public. There’s no substitute for investigative reporters, war correspondents, or interviews that hold powerful people accountable.\n\nIf this site, or others like it, can provide trustworthy summaries of events at low cost, they might help free up human journalists to focus on the reporting only humans can do.\n\nIf a site like this were successful, it would still need a responsible way to fund primary sources of information, beyond what is already available publicly. What does that future look like? Can this be done ethically? Will society be more or less informed?\n\nLaunching\n\nI’m planning a soft launch on Product Hunt and Indie Hackers soon. I also post selected headlines to Bluesky (automated) and Twitter (manual, for now).\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis is a fun hobby, but it’s not free. I’m spending time and money on something that might be useful.\n\nI’d love your feedback: Is the site helpful? Would you read it regularly? What’s missing? Would you trust AI-generated articles that show their sources? Would you prefer a different writing style?\n\nIs AI-generated-news a kind of inevitable market progress, or an unethical misunderstanding of journalism?

As it turns out, the term is nonsensical.\n\nIt sounds technical—maybe even credible—but it’s complete nonsense. And yet, it’s turning up in scientific papers, AI responses, and even peer-reviewed journals. So… how did this phantom phrase become part of our collective knowledge?\n\nAs painstakingly reported by Retraction Watch in February, the term may have been pulled from parallel columns of text in a 1959 paper on bacterial cell walls. The AI seemed to have jumped the columns, reading two unrelated lines of text as one contiguous sentence, according to one investigator.\n\nThe farkakte text is a textbook case of what researchers call a digital fossil: An error that gets preserved in the layers of AI training data and pops up unexpectedly in future outputs. The digital fossils are “nearly impossible to remove from our knowledge repositories,” according to a team of AI researchers who traced the curious case of “vegetative electron microscopy,” as noted in The Conversation.\n\nThe fossilization process started with a simple mistake, as the team reported. Back in the 1950s, two papers were published in Bacteriological Reviews that were later scanned and digitized.\n\nThe layout of the columns as they appeared in those articles confused the digitization software, which mashed up the word “vegetative” from one column with “electron” from another. The fusion is a so-called “tortured phrase”—one that is hidden to the naked eye, but apparent to software and language models that “read” text.\n\nAs chronicled by Retraction Watch, nearly 70 years after the biology papers were published, “vegetative electron microscopy” started popping up in research papers out of Iran.\n\nThere, a Farsi translation glitch may have helped reintroduce the term: the words for “vegetative” and “scanning” differ by just a dot in Persian script—and scanning electron microscopy is a very real thing. That may be all it took for the false terminology to slip back into the scientific record.\n\nBut even if the error began with a human translation, AI replicated it across the web, according to the team who described their findings in The Conversation. The researchers prompted AI models with excerpts of the original papers, and indeed, the AI models reliably completed phrases with the BS term, rather than scientifically valid ones. Older models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-2 and BERT, did not produce the error, giving the researchers an indication of when the contamination of the models’ training data occurred.\n\n“We also found the error persists in later models including GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5,” the group wrote in its post. “This suggests the nonsense term may now be permanently embedded in AI knowledge bases.”\n\nThe group identified the CommonCrawl dataset—a gargantuan repository of scraped internet pages—as the likely source of the unfortunate term that was ultimately picked up by AI models. But as tricky as it was to find the source of the errors, eliminating them is even harder. CommonCrawl consists of petabytes of data, which makes it tough for researchers outside of the largest tech companies to address issues at scale. That’s besides the fact that leading AI companies are famously resistant to sharing their training data.\n\nBut AI companies are only part of the problem—journal-hungry publishers are another beast. As reported by Retraction Watch, the publishing giant Elsevier tried to justify the sensibility of “vegetative electron microscopy” before ultimately issuing a correction.\n\nThe journal Frontiers had its own debacle last year, when it was forced to retract an article that included nonsensical AI-generated images of rat genitals and biological pathways. Earlier this year, a team of researchers in Harvard Kennedy School’s Misinformation Review highlighted the worsening issue of so-called “junk science” on Google Scholar, essentially unscientific bycatch that gets trawled up by the engine.\n\nAI has genuine use cases across the sciences, but its unwieldy deployment at scale is rife with the hazards of misinformation, both for researchers and for the scientifically inclined public. Once the erroneous relics of digitization become embedded in the internet’s fossil record, recent research indicates they’re pretty darn difficult to tamp down."}

I generally read articles/papers or watch videos, and then create papers/articles/code and have discussions as a result. While creating blog posts could be considered ‘giving back’, I think most of the benefit is personal because it (if well-written) forces me to make sense of and distill the ideas therein sufficiently such that someone else can understand me, which requires confronting various weaknesses and problems with the idea and improving on them (This is also one reason why I believe feedback systems are important).\n\nOther sources refer to this as the Knowledge Lifecycle, of which I’ve included a screenshot below (the image comes from A Complete Guide to Tagging for Personal Knowledge Management ( link) — they do a great job explaining this idea in detail which I won’t repeat).\n\nMy Markdown-based Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) notes system, which I’ve been building for years and currently interact with using Obsidian, is a grounds for this. In a nutshell, this is my process:\n\nOrganize how I ingest new knowledge. I usually learn from articles/blogs/papers/videos online and sometimes learn from books as well, but all of these, even finding out about said book, originate from a browser tab. I maintain different sets of browser tabs for different research areas in both work and personal pursuits and organize these using tools such as the awesome BrainTool and sometimes Obsidian. After writing this post, I created a read-it-later solution for this. ^85m76m Any high-quality paper/article/video/etc. I read and want to remember goes into Zotero and synced between laptops/desktops via Syncthing (and is annotated there for PDFs only) (#todo write a post on link rot and my interest in preserving digital information) Said annotations and links to the local Zotero file+URL are synced into Obsidian as a paired ‘Source’ note for whenever I want to write additional things regarding that source of information (via plugin Obsidian-Zotero Integration) Non-Source notes in my PKM system are all my own writings and ideas which I often build off of Sources and their corresponding Source Notes using Markdown links and embeds (though sometimes I lazily skip this and just cite URLs) A few of these notes become well-developed and useful (meaning useful even after they are written—I still think the act of writing itself forces the writer to clarify certain concepts and is useful even if the writing itself isn’t used again) A few useful notes seem interesting enough that I think others may benefit from them, so I spend time improving the prose, generalizing them, etc., and create a blog post.\n\nOut of 100 saved papers/articles, ~20 will have source notes, ~10 of those source notes lead to my own independent idea notes, ~4 of them become well-developed and useful, and just 1 gets turned into a blog post.\n\nThe problem with my previous site setup was that while all of my knowledge (from other sources or from me) was stored in my tightly-integrated Zotero+Obsidian setup (steps 1-4 above), step 5’s blog posts containing in principal my highest-quality technical assimilations of knowledge were disjointly stored in the site’s repository. I’d like to have everything in one place so it is all easily searchable and linkable and therefore give me greater opportunities to make new connections between my ideas and other sources’ ideas. Sure, I can just have multiple copies of the posts, but heaven forbid I have to correct that missed typo in two places. (Though in all seriousness, I wanted to eliminate any friction that would discourage me from publishing new content or improving existing posts.)\n\nThus, I wanted to find a way to better integrate all of my knowledge in one place and also seamlessly publish blog entries to increase the chances of me actually doing so. I may stop using the term ‘blog’ in the future as I expect to update and improve these posts the same way I improve my own private notes (or ‘posts’).\n\n# How I Automate it\n\nI often spend far too many hours building or automating things that have perfectly reasonable alternatives, because I find it fun to understand and control every step of the process (and on some rare occasions it becomes objectively useful as well). I’ve done this with my blog in my 2023 redesign—while I could have easily made an account on https://substack.com/, I prefer to have total control over the look and feel of the site (e.g., no annoying popups to subscribe after reading 1/4 down the article) and already had a simpler custom blog since 2019.\n\nWhen I first acquired the domain ryanwwest.com, I had a Wordpress site for about a month and got very sick of it. I quickly decided instead to make a static site instead by just placing HTML/CSS/JavaScript files on my hosting server, but since I am much more proficient at backend/network software engineering than frontend, I didn’t want to open the door of endless JavaScript frameworks and instead opted to use the Markdown->static site generator Hugo.\n\nHugo works great because I already heavily use Markdown via Obsidian for my PKM system. However, Hugo on its own turned out to be insufficient for my needs, as I only have time to write a blog post very irregularly, and had to remember how to rerun the site generator, log into site server, and publish the new article every time which disincentivized publishing. Any changes to a blog post required repeating the process and the articles were disjoint from the rest of my knowledge base, and I don’t want any friction.\n\nHugo can be customized with themes, and I chose the Quartz Theme which adds goodies like [[Wikilink]] support, search, backlinks, local graph view, dark/light mode toggle, etc. However, while this brings Markdown-style parity between blog post notes and all other notes to be nearly the same, it still doesn’t automate the publishing of posts (and I don’t want to pay $20 a month for something like Obsidian Publish).\n\nThus, I’ve automated it as follows:\n\nOn any device using Obsidian, Vim, or another file editor, I create a blog post in its own Markdown file witin the blog/ subdirectory of my PKM vault. I have a Linux server and sync my PKM vault folder between it and my other computers/devices using Syncthing. My Linux server runs a cron job every minute which runs a script that scans the blog/ subdirectory to get lists of all Markdown files and png/jpg files they link to (which are stored not in blog/ , but media/ with all other non-blog attachments), uses rsync to copy them over to my Hugo directory, and generates the Hugo site based on just those copied files (it excludes Markdown files that are drafts, but I have a ‘staging’ version of my site including drafts available on that server that I can access via my Tailscale personal-only VPN). The same cron job also commits just the public HTML output folder of Hugo to a Git repo (if there are changes) and pushes to GitHub. On my site provider’s Linux server, I run another cron job which periodically tries to pull the same Git repo for changes. Because the repo is just the public HTML, ryanwwest.com just points that repo for the entire site’s HTML/CSS/JavaScript. If I edit a blog post note from Obsidian on any device, it should be live within a few minutes.\n\nI wanted a comment system for my posts as well to allow for generative conversation between myself and interested readers, but didn’t want to host it myself (because more expensive to run, have to deal with spam and a login system, etc.). That disqualified seemingly great self-hosted options like Isso and Discourse, and I didn’t want something proprietary like Disqus which injects its own ads. Hypothesis seems extremely neat for a blog comment system (and technically already exists for every site, but you can fully integrate it without needing a browser extension), but issues include lack of comment moderation (individuals cannot easily make Publisher Groups which allow this), a confusing/unfamiliar interface for post-wide comments (comments that are not specific to a certain line of text in the post), and no comment upvoting system. But I’m keeping an eye on this one. Graham Macphee use Mastodon for blog comments which is neat, but too early for me.\n\nWhat I instead chose was giscus. It uses a GitHub repo’s Discussions feature to give users an almost Reddit-like commenting experience where one Discussion is automatically created for every post. A snippet of JavaScript at the end of this page embeds the comments on the associated GitHub discussion and lets anyone read comments directly on this page, and lets readers with GitHub accounts also comment directly on on this page (or on GitHub). Discussion comments support Markdown and images, reactions, threaded replies, upvoting, and can be sorted by most upvotes/oldest/newest. The biggest problem is that it is dependent on GitHub (including requiring commenters to have a GitHub account), though sorting by top comments also isn’t yet supported directly on the blog page. Since I presume most of my readers are technical, I’m not too concerned about these, but would switch to something else if a better alternative came along. Easily commenting/annotating specific parts of the post might also be nice, as Hypothes.is allows, but this can be partially satisfied with quotes.\n\nGreat source of ideas for other commenting systems: https://darekkay.com/blog/static-site-comments/\n\nGreat post advocating comments within blogs: https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-blog-without-comments-is-not-a-blog/\n\n# Future Improvements\n\nI’d like to have a way to hide certain ‘personal comment’ lines within a blog post’s Markdown file that may contain helpful information for the author but not for readers (like links to other non-blog notes). I specifically left in a #todo ‘comment’ above to illustrate how this was unnecessary for the reader to see, but helpful for me in that context.\n\nBeing able to instantly write and edit blog posts is both a blessing and a curse. A curse, because if I accidentally change a file on any device anywhere, that modification rapidly goes live. Not really a big deal for a small personal blog, but maybe it will come back to bite. (Accidental deletes, on the other hand, are not a problem because rsync doesn’t delete in this case - I must manually remove them, which is only annoying for filename changes)\n\nI’d also like for the table of contents to hover to the left of the main article column when the browser aspect ratio allows it, rather than being pinned to the top of the page.\n\nI have a YouTube channel with just one video (as of 2023-03-22). That may be another good medium for posting future technical content and may be easier and more accessible for content consumption."}

Starting with English and French, the foundation will offer stripped down versions of raw Wikipedia text, excluding any references or markdown code.\n\nBeing a non-profit, volunteer-led platform, Wikipedia monetizes largely through donations and does not own the content it hosts, allowing anyone to use and remix content from the platform. It is fine with other organizations using its vast corpus of knowledge for all sorts of cases—Kiwix, for example, is an offline version of Wikipedia that has been used to smuggle information into North Korea.\n\nBut a flood of bots constantly trawling its website for AI training needs has led to a surge in non-human traffic to Wikipedia, something it was interested in addressing as the costs soared. Earlier this month, the foundation said bandwidth consumption has increased 50% since January 2024. Offering a standard, JSON-formatted version of Wikipedia articles should dissuade AI developers from bombarding the website.\n\n“As the place the machine learning community comes for tools and tests, Kaggle is extremely excited to be the host for the Wikimedia Foundation’s data,” Kaggle partnerships lead Brenda Flynn told The Verge. “Kaggle is excited to play a role in keeping this data accessible, available, and useful.”\n\nIt is no secret that tech companies fundamentally do not respect content creators and place little value on any individual’s creative work. There is a rising school of thought in the industry that all content should be free and that taking it from anywhere on the web to train an AI model constitutes fair use due to the transformative nature of language models.\n\nBut someone has to create the content in the first place, which is not cheap, and AI startups have been all too willing to ignore previously accepted norms around respecting a site’s wishes not to be crawled. Language models that produce human-like text outputs need to be trained on vast amounts of material, and training data has become something akin to oil in the AI boom. It is well known that the leading models are trained using copyrighted works, and several AI companies remain in litigation over the issue. The threat to companies from Chegg to Stack Overflow is that AI companies will ingest their content and return to it users without sending traffic to the companies that made the content in the first place.\n\nSome contributors to Wikipedia may dislike their content being made available for AI training, for these reasons and others. All writing on the website is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, which allows anyone to freely share, adapt, and build upon a work, even commercially, as long as they credit the original creator and license their derivative works under the same terms.\n\nThe dataset through Kaggle is available for any developer to use for free. The Wikimedia Foundation told Gizmodo that Kaggle is accessing Wikipedia’s dataset through a “Structured Content” beta program within the Wikipedia Enterprise suite, a premium offering that allows high-volume users to more easily reuse content. It said that reusers of the content, such as AI model companies, are still expected to respect Wikipedia’s attribution and licensing terms."}

Our new Robot overlords may have to wait a while before they are fast enough chase us meatbags away, but it demonstrated for us how such competitions can be used to advance the state of the art.\n\nThe week’s stand-out hacks included work on non-planar slicing to improve strength of 3D prints. It’s safe to say that the Cartesian 3D printer has matured as a device, but this work proves there’s plenty more in the world of 3D printing to be developed. Then there was a beautiful record cutting lathe project, far more than a toy and capable of producing good quality stereo recordings.\n\nMeanwhile it’s always good to see the price of parts come down, and this time it’s the turn of LIDAR sensors. There’s a Raspberry Pi project capable of astounding resolution, for a price that wouldn’t have been imaginable only recently. Finally we returned to 3D printing, with an entirely printable machine, including the motors and the hot end. It’s a triumph of printed engineering, and though it’s fair to say that you won’t be using it to print anything for yourself, we expect some of the very clever techniques in use to feature in many other projects.\n\nThe week’s cant-miss articles came from Maya Posch with a reality check for lovers of physical media, and Dan Maloney with a history of x-ray detection.

Loading . . .\n\nThe Napalm Girl Standard By: Som-Mai Nguyen Date: Apr. 24, 2025 Illustrations: Nguyen Tran How the war’s most horrific photograph is now a litmus test for free speech in the era of social media.\n\nIt’s a photo you may have already seen. Captured in stark black and white, several Vietnamese children run down a road, flanked by soldiers. In the left foreground, there is a crying child whose mouth is contorted. But the viewer’s eye drifts toward the center and the main subject of the photograph: a 9-year-old girl, who is naked, crying, and shrieking in agony from the burns on her body. The photograph is titled “The Terror of War,” but it is ubiquitously known as the Napalm Girl photograph.\n\nThe napalm attack that the children were fleeing was an instance of friendly fire, carried out by South Vietnamese forces allied with the United States, flying American-made planes and dropping American napalm in an attempt to flush out Northern forces from hiding. This image, for which Huỳnh Công “Nick” Út was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, was taken in Trảng Bàng, an hour’s drive northwest of today’s Ho Chi Minh City, in June 1972.\n\n“The Terror of War” is sometimes credited with ending the war through sheer emotional impact, swinging American public opinion toward military withdrawal and eventually bringing about the Paris Peace Accords in January 1973. The photograph was indeed powerful. (US President Richard Nixon can be heard wondering whether the photograph had been doctored in a White House audio recording. In another, he encouraged Henry Kissinger to “think big” and suggested the nuclear bomb.) But in truth, the tide of public opinion had already turned years prior. A year before the photograph was taken, 61 percent of American respondents to a June 1971 Gallup poll answered that it had been a mistake to send US troops to Vietnam; only 28 percent maintained that it had not. Six years earlier, in August 1965, only 24 percent had believed involvement to be a mistake, while 61 percent had not.\n\nIf the Napalm Girl photograph played a role in ending the war, it was as part of a larger technological media shift that had pervaded the entire Vietnam War. From the 1950s until its withdrawal from the war in 1973, the US supplied arms, troops, and death to Southeast Asia. Contemporaneous developments in media technology — that is, television broadcasting and photojournalism — made war newly visible to the American public. The response was overwhelming. Until as recently as 1945, political or religious commitment to pacifism could serve as a bar to naturalization, but the Vietnam War redefined antiwar activism as mainstream societal discontent, taken up by intellectuals, rockstars, and Hollywood celebrities alike.\n\nIt is no wonder that this era generated some of America’s most important case law around the freedom of speech. In the Pentagon Papers case, the Nixon Administration targeted the press that had brought home the horror of war; countless cases related to antiwar demonstrations redefined everything from students’ right to protest to the legality of displaying the word “fuck” in public.\n\nAs with Nixon, today’s executive has launched an onslaught on speech, including plans to expand ICE’s existing surveillance dragnet by punishing noncitizens merely for perceived dissent on social media. These attacks reflect how, in the present day, much of American political life in no small part takes place online, via internet platforms and social media networks with complex and often opaque content moderation apparatuses. There, the legacy of the Vietnam War can also be found.\n\n“The Terror of War” is, after all, a violent, nonconsensual nude image of a child. It is also of tremendous historical importance — and before it became history itself, it was hard-hitting, weighty speech of a political nature. It is a troubling photograph that lives at the boundary of free speech; a difficult edge case for social media platforms that has come up time and again as they set, adjust, and modify their content moderation standards. The Napalm Girl photograph has left an indelible mark on how speech is governed, despite never establishing court precedent at all.\n\nLoading . . . The Napalm Girl photograph has left an indelible mark on how speech is governed, despite never establishing court precedent at all\n\nThe girl in the photograph, Kim Phúc Phan Thị, defected to Canada some decades later. In 2022, she penned an op-ed in The New York Times, looking back on the 50 years since the picture was taken, during which she had been reduced to “a symbol of the horrors of war.”\n\nPhan grew up “detesting” the photograph, which had been shot and distributed without her consent. “I thought to myself, ‘I am a little girl. I am naked. Why did he take that picture? Why didn’t my parents protect me? Why did he print that photo? Why was I the only kid naked while my brothers and cousins in the photo had their clothes on?’”\n\nShe was grateful to the photographer for later taking her to receive medical care; she even credited him with saving her life. But still, Phan identified a sense of violation, trauma layered on top of trauma, an assault on her privacy and bodily autonomy that was inextricable from her memories of the war and the burn scars she carried on one-third of her body.\n\nThe historical importance and wide dissemination of “The Terror of War” is particularly bizarre, given that nude images of children are a category of speech that is infamous for its inflexible prohibition. These images are so categorically condemned that Congress passed a law in 1996 that banned “sexually explicit images that appear to depict minors” that were produced without using any real children — a prohibition so broad that it practically anticipates current-day debates on nonconsensual AI-generated pornography. (The Supreme Court partially struck down the law, finding the broadest provisions to violate the First Amendment; some years later, the similarly written 2003 Protect Act was ultimately upheld.)\n\nThe prohibitions on child pornography are so broad, so socially uncontested, that there is not much room for debate. But discussion of the lasting impact that a photograph can have on its subject can be found with respect to a newer, overlapping category of prohibited speech: nonconsensual intimate images, sometimes called revenge porn. The banned activity usually involves the distribution of explicit images of individuals without their consent and may include images originally obtained or produced without consent (e.g., hidden camera footage, deepfakes), as well as images that were originally obtained with consent (e.g., something shared with a romantic partner) but distributed without consent. In either case, such violations can cause reputational and psychological harm that is irreparable.\n\nNonconsensual intimate images are a relatively new category of banned speech, one that is prohibited through a federal cause of action in the 2022 Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act, a patchwork set of narrowly tailored state laws, and content moderation standards across the internet.\n\nNot very many people can say that they, too, were victims of a napalm attack, but the emotional damage that Phan attributes to “The Terror of War” will sound all too familiar to other victims of nonconsensual intimate images — her anxiety and shame, her unwilling place in the public eye. Her photograph was neither taken nor disseminated with malicious intent, but intent cannot erase impact. Her account of the psychological turmoil she experienced over the decades is deeply troubling, particularly when one considers how “The Terror of War” is treated as an exception and counterpoint to other nonconsensual nude images, whether of adults or minors.\n\nThe Napalm Girl photograph is a recurring motif in current speech policy, which is due to a rash in nonconsensual intimate images online and the activism to shut it down, whether through statutes or platform content moderation. In 2014, when the Arizona state legislature criminalized the display, publication, and sale of such images, the ACLU of Arizona argued — successfully — that the statute as written was overbroad, since it would have prohibited the dissemination of the Napalm Girl photograph, among other historically significant photos. When Rhode Island passed its own law, its ACLU affiliate once again raised the specter of “The Terror of War,” saying that, as written, “a newspaper would have to think twice before publishing an iconic photo like the Vietnam ‘napalm girl’ because the dissemination of such a photo could run afoul of the law depending on a jury’s view of its ‘newsworthiness.’”\n\nWhile courts and legislatures across the country grappled with balancing nonconsensual intimate images against the historical and political impact of the Napalm Girl, social media platforms like Facebook were developing their own content moderation policies in parallel. In 2016, Norwegian journalist Tom Egeland included the Napalm Girl photograph in a piece on famous images of war. It featured as the banner image for the article on Facebook, which removed the post and suspended Egeland, citing impermissible nudity. When his newspaper, Aftenposten, reported on the suspension, Facebook responded that “[a]ny photographs of people displaying fully nude genitalia or buttocks, or fully nude female breast, will be removed.” Aftenposten’s article reporting on the removal of the article — which also featured the Napalm Girl photograph — was then deleted from the paper’s Facebook page.\n\nFacebook retreated from its position after sustained outrage. “Sometimes, the global and historical importance of a photo like ‘Terror of War’ outweighs the importance of keeping nudity off Facebook,” Justin Osofsky, Meta’s head of partnerships and business development, posted in concession.\n\nAlthough Facebook characterized the deletion as a “mistake,” employees later told Reuters that the Napalm Girl photograph had been used specifically as a training example for content moderation staff, who were instructed that it violated Facebook policy despite historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress, photographed without her consent.\n\nMeta’s Transparency Center explains that it “introduced [its] newsworthiness allowance in October 2016 after receiving global criticism for removing the iconic ‘Napalm Girl’ photo, which, as a result of this allowance, is visible across [Meta] platforms today.”\n\nThe wording oddly conflates “newsworthiness” — which suggests the ongoing or prospective — with historical significance. Meta’s other publicly listed examples of newsworthy determinations all involve contemporary war or political debates. It’s unclear how many, if any, among the 169 total between June 2021 through June 2024 involve historical photojournalism, though we do know that in 2018, Facebook deleted and later reinstated a post on Holocaust awareness that used a photograph of stripped and emaciated children in a Nazi concentration camp. The restoration of the post came with apologies and acknowledgment of an “important image of historical significance.”\n\nSince November 18th, 2020, Meta’s child nudity policy has provided an exception for “[i]magery posted by a news agency that depicts child nudity in the context of famine, genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity, unless accompanied by a violating caption or shared in a violating context, in which case the content is removed.” The policy might as well bear Phan’s name.\n\nLoading . . . No photo could launch an antiwar movement; rather, the movement captioned the photo\n\nSo what has the photograph of Phan been retroactively tasked with, when it is held up as an image of “global and historical significance”? The treacly notion that this image ended the war because Americans had never before seen the true violence of war doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.\n\nThe death and destruction left behind on the battlefield of Gettysburg was documented in soft sepia tones. The horrors of Dachau were photographed and published en masse as a series of postcards at the immediate close of World War II, possibly as part of a larger campaign to publicize Nazi atrocities. In 1968, only four years prior to the publication of “The Terror of War,” hundreds of unarmed civilians were massacred at Mỹ Lai. The extensive photographic documentation of the slaughter was made public the following year when William Calley Jr. was court-martialed. In On Photography, Susan Sontag mused on whether the American public would have more vociferously opposed the Korean War if had been confronted with the photographic barrage that came with Vietnam. Sontag ultimately dismissed the possibility, concluding instead that the Vietnam War had already been “defined by a significant number of people as a savage colonialist war” and that the photographs — many of which had a military origin and “were taken with quite a different use in mind” — were published by the media in a preexisting social context and narrative. No photo could launch an antiwar movement; rather, the movement captioned the photo.\n\nToday, mass civilian murders and war crimes have been robustly documented by both local and international photojournalists in Gaza, Mariupol, and Goma. If the notion that a single image could change the world in 1972 is suspect, it seems all the more implausible in today’s information environment, where the ease of online dissemination and more sophisticated image creation, editing, and generation tools subjects us to a merciless barrage of content. At the 24-hour online cinerama, all military carnage is rendered mundane, though some atrocities are branded more mundane than others.\n\nMeanwhile, the Napalm Girl photograph continues to haunt First Amendment law. As recently as 2022, an Indiana state appellate judge referenced the photograph in a dissent on a child pornography conviction. Lawyers, as a class, might be criticized for a medical dependence on hypotheticals, but the Napalm Girl photograph is not just a holster-ready gotcha to foil attempts at regulating nonconsensual image capture and proliferation. Rather, like many edge cases, it helps us think: despite it unquestionably violating most people’s social mores, most people would also agree on the photograph’s historical significance.\n\nAs an edge case, “The Terror of War” elicits something unworkably tautological about trying to determine whether an image is important enough to override a general prohibition on child nudity. If “historical significance” is a criterion, the Napalm Girl’s photograph will only become compoundingly more significant the longer it survives and the more it is referenced. And the longer the Napalm Girl is the standard, the more impossible it becomes to supplant it as the premier edge case. Even as the particulars of the Vietnam War blur and fade away from American memory, the photograph collects tenure in its role as a standard of historical import. Content moderation policies will evolve and change — that is the nature of content moderation, after all — but the photograph of Kim Phúc Phan Thị will remain, a guidepost by which speech is measured."}

The people running these scams have gotten much smarter, and they’re using tricks that your regular fraud tools might miss.\n\nIt’s a big business, and if you think you are not affected, you are wrong.\n\nHere’s what’s really happening to your ad budget: Real people in click farms are getting paid to click on ads all day long.\n\nThey use VPNs to hide where they’re really coming from, making them look just like normal customers. And they’re good at it.\n\nThe bots have gotten better, too. They now copy exactly how real people use websites: They move the mouse naturally, fill out forms like humans, and even make typing mistakes on purpose.\n\nWhen these smart bots team up with real people, they become really hard to spot.\n\nThe scammers are also messing with your tracking in clever ways. They can trick your website into thinking they’re new visitors every time.\n\nThey can make their phones seem like they’re in your target city when they’re actually on the other side of the world.\n\nIf you’re counting on basic click fraud protection to catch all this, you’re in trouble. These aren’t the obvious fake clicks from years ago – they’re smart attacks that need smart solutions.\n\nThat being said, the good old competitor trying to click 50 times on your ad is also still existent and not going away anytime soon.\n\nLuckily, it is safe to say that Google can spot and detect those obvious fraud clicks in many cases.\n\nGoogle’s Click Fraud Dilemma: Walking The Revenue Tightrope\n\nGoogle faces a tricky problem with click fraud.\n\nEvery fake click puts money in Google’s pocket right now, but too many fake clicks will drive advertisers away. This creates a conflict of interest.\n\nGoogle needs to show that it’s fighting click fraud to keep advertisers happy and the ad platform and all of its networks healthy, but it can’t afford to catch every single fake click.\n\nIf it did, its ad revenue would drop sharply in the short term because it also runs the risk of blocking valid clicks if it goes in too aggressively.\n\nBut if it doesn’t catch enough fraud, advertisers will lose trust and move their budgets elsewhere.\n\nSome advertisers say this explains why Google’s fraud detection isn’t as strict as it could be.\n\nThey argue Google has found a sweet spot where it catches just enough fraud to keep advertisers from leaving, but not so much that it seriously hurts its revenue.\n\nThis balance gets even harder as fraudsters get better at making fake clicks look real.\n\nThis is also why many advertisers don’t fully trust Google’s own click fraud detection and prefer to use third-party tools.\n\nThese tools tend to flag more clicks as fraudulent than Google does, suggesting Google might be more conservative in what it considers fraud.\n\nThe Over-Blocking Problem Of Third-Party Tools\n\nThird-party click fraud tools have their own business problem: They need to prove they’re worth paying for every month.\n\nThis creates pressure to show lots of “blocked fraud” to justify their subscription costs. The result? Many of these tools are too aggressive and often block real customers by mistake.\n\nOther tactics are to show lots of suspicious traffic or activities.\n\nThink about it. If a click fraud tool shows zero fraud for a few weeks, clients might think they don’t need it anymore and cancel.\n\nSo, these tools tend to set their detection rules very strict, marking anything slightly suspicious as fraud. This means they might block a real person who:\n\nUses a VPN for privacy.\n\nShares an IP address with others (like in an office).\n\nBrowses with privacy tools.\n\nHas unusual but legitimate clicking patterns.\n\nThis over-blocking can actually hurt businesses more than the fraud these tools claim to stop.\n\nIt’s like a store security guard who’s so worried about shoplifters that they start turning away honest customers, too.\n\nWhy Click Fraud Tools Are Still Valuable\n\nDespite these issues, click fraud tools are still really useful as a first line of defense.\n\nThey’re like security cameras for your ad traffic. They might not catch everything perfectly, but they give you a good picture of what’s happening.\n\nHere’s what makes them worth using:\n\nThey quickly show you patterns in your traffic that humans would take weeks to spot.\n\nEven if they’re sometimes wrong about individual clicks, they’re good at finding unusual patterns, like lots of clicks from the same place or at odd hours.\n\nThey give you data you can use to make your own decisions – you don’t have to block everything they flag as suspicious.\n\nThe key is to use these tools as a starting point, not a final answer. Look at their reports, but think about them carefully.\n\nAre the “suspicious” clicks actually hurting your business? Do blocked users fit your customer profile?\n\nUse the tool’s data along with your own knowledge about your customers to make smarter decisions about what’s really fraud and what’s not.\n\nIn terms of functionality, most third-party click fraud detection tools are somewhat similar to each other.\n\nA simple Google search on “click fraud tool” shows the market leaders; the only bigger difference is usually pricing and contract duration.\n\nTackling Click Fraud With Custom Solutions\n\nAfter getting a first impression with third-party click fraud tools, it’s best to build a collection of custom solutions to tackle your individual scenario.\n\nEvery business has a different situation with different software environments, website systems, and monitoring.\n\nFor custom solutions, it’s recommended to work closely with your IT department or developer, as many solutions require some modification on your website.\n\nThe Basics: Selecting An Identifier\n\nThere are a handful of solutions to cover 80% of the basics.\n\nThe first way to do something against click fraud is to find a unique identifier to work with.\n\nIn most cases, this will be the IP address since you can exclude certain IP addresses from Google Ads, thus making it a good identifier to work with.\n\nOther identifiers like Fingerprints are also possible options. Once an identifier is found, you need to make sure your server logs or internal tracking can monitor users and their identifiers for further analysis.\n\nThe Basics: CAPTCHAs\n\nAnother basic tool, which is often forgotten, is CAPTCHAs.\n\nCAPTCHAs can detect bots or fraudulent traffic. Google offers a free and simple-to-implement solution with reCAPTCHA.\n\nCAPTCHAs might seem like an easy answer to bot traffic, but they come with serious downsides.\n\nEvery time you add a CAPTCHA, you’re basically telling your real users, “Prove you’re human before I trust you.” This creates friction, and friction kills conversions.\n\nMost websites see a drop in form completions after adding CAPTCHAs if they are set too aggressively.\n\nSmart CAPTCHAs can limit the frequency, but not all CAPTCHA providers allow that option, so choose your provider or solution wisely.\n\nThe Basics: Honeypot Fields\n\nHoneypot fields are hidden form fields that act as traps for bots.\n\nThe trick is simple but effective: Add extra fields to your form that real people can’t see, but bots will try to fill out.\n\nOnly bots reading the raw HTML will find these fields; regular users won’t even know they’re there. The key is to make these fields look real to bots.\n\nUse names that bots love to fill in, like “url,” “website,” or “email2.” If any of these hidden fields get filled out, you know it’s probably a bot. Real people won’t see them, so they can’t fill them out.\n\nPro tip: Don’t just add “honeypot” or “trap” to your field names. Bots are getting smarter and often check for obvious trap names. Instead, use names that look like regular-form fields.\n\nAdvanced Validation Methods\n\nSmart Form Validation: Email\n\nMost businesses only check if an email address has an “@” symbol and looks roughly correct.\n\nThis basic approach leaves the door wide open for fake leads and spam submissions.\n\nModern email validation needs to go much deeper. Start by examining the email’s basic structure, but don’t stop there.\n\nLook at the domain itself: Is it real? How long has it existed? Does it have proper mail server records?\n\nThese checks can happen in real time while your user fills out the form. It should be noted, however, that smart form validation usually requires some sort of third-party provider to check the details, which means you need to rely on external services.\n\nA common mistake is blocking all free email providers like Gmail or Yahoo. This might seem logical, but it’s a costly error.\n\nMany legitimate business users rely on Gmail for their day-to-day operations, especially small business owners.\n\nInstead of blanket blocks, look for unusual patterns within these email addresses. A Gmail address with a normal name pattern is probably fine; one with a random string of characters should raise red flags.\n\nFor enterprise B2B sales, you expect bigger companies to sign up with their company domain email address, so blocking free mail providers might work.\n\nSmart Form Validation: Phone\n\nPhone validation goes far beyond just counting digits. Think about the logic of location first.\n\nWhen someone enters a phone number with a New York area code but lists their address in California, that’s worth investigating.\n\nBut be careful with this approach – people move, they travel, and they keep their old numbers. The key is to use these mismatches as flags for further verification, not as automatic rejections.\n\nThe Art Of Smart Data Formatting\n\nData formatting isn’t just about making your database look neat. It’s about catching mistakes and fraud while making the form easy to complete for legitimate users.\n\nName fields are a perfect example.\n\nWhile you want to catch obviously fake names like “asdfgh” or repeated characters, remember that real names come in an incredible variety of formats and styles.\n\nSome cultures use single names, others have very long names, and some include characters that might look unusual to your system.\n\nModify Your Google Ads Campaign Settings To Tackle Click Fraud\n\nGoogle offers multiple campaign options to increase reach, on the downside most of those options come along with an increase of click fraud activities.\n\nApp Placements\n\nPerformance Max campaigns can place your ads across Google’s entire network, including in apps. While this broad reach can be powerful, it also opens the door to potential fraud.\n\nThe challenge is that you have limited control over where your ads appear, and some of these automatic placements can lead to wasted ad spend.\n\nKids’ games are often a major source of accidental and fraudulent clicks. These apps frequently have buttons placed near ad spaces, and children playing games can accidentally tap ads while trying to play.\n\nWhat looks like engagement in your analytics is actually just frustrated kids trying to hit the “play” button.\n\nAnother issue comes from apps that use deceptive design to generate clicks. They might place clickable elements right where ads appear, or design their interface so users naturally tap where ads are located.\n\nThis isn’t always intentional fraud. Sometimes, it’s just poor app design, but it costs you money either way.\n\nUnlike traditional campaigns, where you can easily exclude specific placements, Performance Max’s automation makes this more challenging.\n\nThe system optimizes for conversions, but it might not recognize that clicks from certain apps never lead to quality leads. By the time you spot the pattern, you’ve already spent money on these low-quality clicks.\n\nExcluding app placements is for almost all advertisers a must have. Very few advertisers benefit from app placements at all.\n\nPartner And Display Network\n\nLead generation businesses face a unique challenge with Performance Max campaigns that ecommerce stores can largely avoid.\n\nWhile ecommerce businesses can simply run Shopping-only campaigns and tap into high-intent product searches, lead gen businesses are stuck dealing with the full Performance Max package, including the often problematic Display Network.\n\nThe Display Network opens up your ads to a mass of websites, many of which might not be the quality placements you’d want for your business.\n\nWhile Google tries to filter out bad actors, the display network still includes sites that exist primarily to generate ad clicks.\n\nThese sites might look legitimate at first glance, but they’re designed to encourage accidental clicks or attract bot traffic.\n\nSome are specifically designed for server bot farms, as they run on expired domains and have no content besides ads.\n\nLead generation businesses don’t have this luxury. Their Performance Max campaigns typically run on all networks except shopping. This creates several problems:\n\nThe quality of clicks varies wildly. Someone might click your medical practice ad while trying to close a pop-up on a gaming site. They’ll never become a patient, but you still pay for that click.\n\nSomeone might click your medical practice ad while trying to close a pop-up on a gaming site. They’ll never become a patient, but you still pay for that click. Display placements can appear on sites that don’t match your brand’s professional image. Imagine a law firm’s ad showing up on a site full of questionable content – not ideal for building trust with potential clients.\n\nImagine a law firm’s ad showing up on a site full of questionable content – not ideal for building trust with potential clients. Bot traffic and click farms often target display ads because they’re easier to interact with than shopping ads. You might see high click-through rates that look great until you realize none of these clicks are turning into leads.\n\nAll those are reasons to question PMax campaigns for lead gen, but that’s a decision every marketer has to make.\n\nAdvanced Google Ads Settings To Tackle Click Fraud\n\nIf the basics are implemented but there is still a higher amount of suspected click fraud, advanced solutions need to be implemented.\n\nBesides excluding suspicious IP addresses, you can also build negative audiences.\n\nThe idea is to have a second success page for your lead generation form and only forward potential bots or fake sign-ups to this page.\n\nTo achieve that, your website needs to evaluate potential bots live during the sign-up process.\n\nYou can then setup a dedicated “bot pixel” on the second success page in order to send data of this audience to Google.\n\nOnce enough data is retrieved, you can exclude this audience from your campaigns. This approach is a little trickier to implement but is worth the effort as those audience signals are of high quality if enough data is supplied.\n\nMake sure to only fire the “bot pixel” on the special success page and only there, otherwise you run the risk of mixing your audiences which would render the system useless.\n\nFiltering Fake Leads With Conditional Triggers\n\nAnother tracking-based strategy is to set up condition-based conversion tracking. Combined with hidden form fields, you can modify the conversion trigger not to send data if the hidden field was filled.\n\nIn that scenario, you would filter out bots from conversion tracking, sending back only real conversion to your campaign, and therefore, also training the Google algorithm and bidding strategy only on real data.\n\nYou eliminate a majority of fake leads and traffic with this setup.\n\nMaking Sign-Ups More Challenging To Improve Lead Quality\n\nAnother advanced strategy is to make the sign-up process a lot harder.\n\nTests have shown that much longer forms are not finished by bots because they are usually trained on simpler and shorter forms, which require only mail, name, phone, and address.\n\nAsking specific questions and working with dropdowns can dramatically increase the lead quality. It should be noted, however, that longer forms can also hurt the valid signup rate, which is a risk you want to take if you have to deal with bot and fraud traffic.\n\nA fitting case was a car dealer I worked with. They had a form where people could offer their cars for sale and retrieve a price estimate.\n\nA short form had almost three times the signup rate than before, but it turned out later that a lot of them were spam signups or even very low-qualified leads.\n\nA shorter form leads to more spam because it’s easy to sign up. After switching to a longer form, the signups dropped, but quality increased drastically.\n\nAlmost 20 fields long, and potential clients had to upload pictures of their car.\n\nIt took a few minutes to finish the signup, but those who did were committed to doing business and open to discussing the sale, which also made it easier for the salespeople to follow up properly.\n\nA Hard Truth About Lead Fraud\n\nLet’s be honest: You can’t completely stop lead fraud. It’s like shoplifting in retail – you can reduce it, you can catch it faster, but you can’t eliminate it entirely.\n\nThe fraudsters are always getting smarter, and for every security measure we create, they’ll eventually find a way around it.\n\nBut here’s the good news: You don’t need perfect protection. What you need is a balanced approach that catches most of the bad leads while letting good ones through easily.\n\nThink of it like running a store: You want security, but not so much that it scares away real customers.\n\nThe key is to layer your defenses. Use click fraud tools as your first line of defense, add smart form validation as your second, and keep a human eye on patterns as your final check.\n\nWill some fake leads still get through? Yes. But if you can stop 90% of the fraud, you’re winning the battle.\n\nRemember: Perfect is the enemy of good.

The people running these scams have gotten much smarter, and they’re using tricks that your regular fraud tools might miss.\n\nIt’s a big business, and if you think you are not affected, you are wrong.\n\nHere’s what’s really happening to your ad budget: Real people in click farms are getting paid to click on ads all day long.\n\nThey use VPNs to hide where they’re really coming from, making them look just like normal customers. And they’re good at it.\n\nThe bots have gotten better, too. They now copy exactly how real people use websites: They move the mouse naturally, fill out forms like humans, and even make typing mistakes on purpose.\n\nWhen these smart bots team up with real people, they become really hard to spot.\n\nThe scammers are also messing with your tracking in clever ways. They can trick your website into thinking they’re new visitors every time.\n\nThey can make their phones seem like they’re in your target city when they’re actually on the other side of the world.\n\nIf you’re counting on basic click fraud protection to catch all this, you’re in trouble. These aren’t the obvious fake clicks from years ago – they’re smart attacks that need smart solutions.\n\nThat being said, the good old competitor trying to click 50 times on your ad is also still existent and not going away anytime soon.\n\nLuckily, it is safe to say that Google can spot and detect those obvious fraud clicks in many cases.\n\nGoogle’s Click Fraud Dilemma: Walking The Revenue Tightrope\n\nGoogle faces a tricky problem with click fraud.\n\nEvery fake click puts money in Google’s pocket right now, but too many fake clicks will drive advertisers away. This creates a conflict of interest.\n\nGoogle needs to show that it’s fighting click fraud to keep advertisers happy and the ad platform and all of its networks healthy, but it can’t afford to catch every single fake click.\n\nIf it did, its ad revenue would drop sharply in the short term because it also runs the risk of blocking valid clicks if it goes in too aggressively.\n\nBut if it doesn’t catch enough fraud, advertisers will lose trust and move their budgets elsewhere.\n\nSome advertisers say this explains why Google’s fraud detection isn’t as strict as it could be.\n\nThey argue Google has found a sweet spot where it catches just enough fraud to keep advertisers from leaving, but not so much that it seriously hurts its revenue.\n\nThis balance gets even harder as fraudsters get better at making fake clicks look real.\n\nThis is also why many advertisers don’t fully trust Google’s own click fraud detection and prefer to use third-party tools.\n\nThese tools tend to flag more clicks as fraudulent than Google does, suggesting Google might be more conservative in what it considers fraud.\n\nThe Over-Blocking Problem Of Third-Party Tools\n\nThird-party click fraud tools have their own business problem: They need to prove they’re worth paying for every month.\n\nThis creates pressure to show lots of “blocked fraud” to justify their subscription costs. The result? Many of these tools are too aggressive and often block real customers by mistake.\n\nOther tactics are to show lots of suspicious traffic or activities.\n\nThink about it. If a click fraud tool shows zero fraud for a few weeks, clients might think they don’t need it anymore and cancel.\n\nSo, these tools tend to set their detection rules very strict, marking anything slightly suspicious as fraud. This means they might block a real person who:\n\nUses a VPN for privacy.\n\nShares an IP address with others (like in an office).\n\nBrowses with privacy tools.\n\nHas unusual but legitimate clicking patterns.\n\nThis over-blocking can actually hurt businesses more than the fraud these tools claim to stop.\n\nIt’s like a store security guard who’s so worried about shoplifters that they start turning away honest customers, too.\n\nWhy Click Fraud Tools Are Still Valuable\n\nDespite these issues, click fraud tools are still really useful as a first line of defense.\n\nThey’re like security cameras for your ad traffic. They might not catch everything perfectly, but they give you a good picture of what’s happening.\n\nHere’s what makes them worth using:\n\nThey quickly show you patterns in your traffic that humans would take weeks to spot.\n\nEven if they’re sometimes wrong about individual clicks, they’re good at finding unusual patterns, like lots of clicks from the same place or at odd hours.\n\nThey give you data you can use to make your own decisions – you don’t have to block everything they flag as suspicious.\n\nThe key is to use these tools as a starting point, not a final answer. Look at their reports, but think about them carefully.\n\nAre the “suspicious” clicks actually hurting your business? Do blocked users fit your customer profile?\n\nUse the tool’s data along with your own knowledge about your customers to make smarter decisions about what’s really fraud and what’s not.\n\nIn terms of functionality, most third-party click fraud detection tools are somewhat similar to each other.\n\nA simple Google search on “click fraud tool” shows the market leaders; the only bigger difference is usually pricing and contract duration.\n\nTackling Click Fraud With Custom Solutions\n\nAfter getting a first impression with third-party click fraud tools, it’s best to build a collection of custom solutions to tackle your individual scenario.\n\nEvery business has a different situation with different software environments, website systems, and monitoring.\n\nFor custom solutions, it’s recommended to work closely with your IT department or developer, as many solutions require some modification on your website.\n\nThe Basics: Selecting An Identifier\n\nThere are a handful of solutions to cover 80% of the basics.\n\nThe first way to do something against click fraud is to find a unique identifier to work with.\n\nIn most cases, this will be the IP address since you can exclude certain IP addresses from Google Ads, thus making it a good identifier to work with.\n\nOther identifiers like Fingerprints are also possible options. Once an identifier is found, you need to make sure your server logs or internal tracking can monitor users and their identifiers for further analysis.\n\nThe Basics: CAPTCHAs\n\nAnother basic tool, which is often forgotten, is CAPTCHAs.\n\nCAPTCHAs can detect bots or fraudulent traffic. Google offers a free and simple-to-implement solution with reCAPTCHA.\n\nCAPTCHAs might seem like an easy answer to bot traffic, but they come with serious downsides.\n\nEvery time you add a CAPTCHA, you’re basically telling your real users, “Prove you’re human before I trust you.” This creates friction, and friction kills conversions.\n\nMost websites see a drop in form completions after adding CAPTCHAs if they are set too aggressively.\n\nSmart CAPTCHAs can limit the frequency, but not all CAPTCHA providers allow that option, so choose your provider or solution wisely.\n\nThe Basics: Honeypot Fields\n\nHoneypot fields are hidden form fields that act as traps for bots.\n\nThe trick is simple but effective: Add extra fields to your form that real people can’t see, but bots will try to fill out.\n\nOnly bots reading the raw HTML will find these fields; regular users won’t even know they’re there. The key is to make these fields look real to bots.\n\nUse names that bots love to fill in, like “url,” “website,” or “email2.” If any of these hidden fields get filled out, you know it’s probably a bot. Real people won’t see them, so they can’t fill them out.\n\nPro tip: Don’t just add “honeypot” or “trap” to your field names. Bots are getting smarter and often check for obvious trap names. Instead, use names that look like regular-form fields.\n\nAdvanced Validation Methods\n\nSmart Form Validation: Email\n\nMost businesses only check if an email address has an “@” symbol and looks roughly correct.\n\nThis basic approach leaves the door wide open for fake leads and spam submissions.\n\nModern email validation needs to go much deeper. Start by examining the email’s basic structure, but don’t stop there.\n\nLook at the domain itself: Is it real? How long has it existed? Does it have proper mail server records?\n\nThese checks can happen in real time while your user fills out the form. It should be noted, however, that smart form validation usually requires some sort of third-party provider to check the details, which means you need to rely on external services.\n\nA common mistake is blocking all free email providers like Gmail or Yahoo. This might seem logical, but it’s a costly error.\n\nMany legitimate business users rely on Gmail for their day-to-day operations, especially small business owners.\n\nInstead of blanket blocks, look for unusual patterns within these email addresses. A Gmail address with a normal name pattern is probably fine; one with a random string of characters should raise red flags.\n\nFor enterprise B2B sales, you expect bigger companies to sign up with their company domain email address, so blocking free mail providers might work.\n\nSmart Form Validation: Phone\n\nPhone validation goes far beyond just counting digits. Think about the logic of location first.\n\nWhen someone enters a phone number with a New York area code but lists their address in California, that’s worth investigating.\n\nBut be careful with this approach – people move, they travel, and they keep their old numbers. The key is to use these mismatches as flags for further verification, not as automatic rejections.\n\nThe Art Of Smart Data Formatting\n\nData formatting isn’t just about making your database look neat. It’s about catching mistakes and fraud while making the form easy to complete for legitimate users.\n\nName fields are a perfect example.\n\nWhile you want to catch obviously fake names like “asdfgh” or repeated characters, remember that real names come in an incredible variety of formats and styles.\n\nSome cultures use single names, others have very long names, and some include characters that might look unusual to your system.\n\nModify Your Google Ads Campaign Settings To Tackle Click Fraud\n\nGoogle offers multiple campaign options to increase reach, on the downside most of those options come along with an increase of click fraud activities.\n\nApp Placements\n\nPerformance Max campaigns can place your ads across Google’s entire network, including in apps. While this broad reach can be powerful, it also opens the door to potential fraud.\n\nThe challenge is that you have limited control over where your ads appear, and some of these automatic placements can lead to wasted ad spend.\n\nKids’ games are often a major source of accidental and fraudulent clicks. These apps frequently have buttons placed near ad spaces, and children playing games can accidentally tap ads while trying to play.\n\nWhat looks like engagement in your analytics is actually just frustrated kids trying to hit the “play” button.\n\nAnother issue comes from apps that use deceptive design to generate clicks. They might place clickable elements right where ads appear, or design their interface so users naturally tap where ads are located.\n\nThis isn’t always intentional fraud. Sometimes, it’s just poor app design, but it costs you money either way.\n\nUnlike traditional campaigns, where you can easily exclude specific placements, Performance Max’s automation makes this more challenging.\n\nThe system optimizes for conversions, but it might not recognize that clicks from certain apps never lead to quality leads. By the time you spot the pattern, you’ve already spent money on these low-quality clicks.\n\nExcluding app placements is for almost all advertisers a must have. Very few advertisers benefit from app placements at all.\n\nPartner And Display Network\n\nLead generation businesses face a unique challenge with Performance Max campaigns that ecommerce stores can largely avoid.\n\nWhile ecommerce businesses can simply run Shopping-only campaigns and tap into high-intent product searches, lead gen businesses are stuck dealing with the full Performance Max package, including the often problematic Display Network.\n\nThe Display Network opens up your ads to a mass of websites, many of which might not be the quality placements you’d want for your business.\n\nWhile Google tries to filter out bad actors, the display network still includes sites that exist primarily to generate ad clicks.\n\nThese sites might look legitimate at first glance, but they’re designed to encourage accidental clicks or attract bot traffic.\n\nSome are specifically designed for server bot farms, as they run on expired domains and have no content besides ads.\n\nLead generation businesses don’t have this luxury. Their Performance Max campaigns typically run on all networks except shopping. This creates several problems:\n\nThe quality of clicks varies wildly. Someone might click your medical practice ad while trying to close a pop-up on a gaming site. They’ll never become a patient, but you still pay for that click.\n\nSomeone might click your medical practice ad while trying to close a pop-up on a gaming site. They’ll never become a patient, but you still pay for that click. Display placements can appear on sites that don’t match your brand’s professional image. Imagine a law firm’s ad showing up on a site full of questionable content – not ideal for building trust with potential clients.\n\nImagine a law firm’s ad showing up on a site full of questionable content – not ideal for building trust with potential clients. Bot traffic and click farms often target display ads because they’re easier to interact with than shopping ads. You might see high click-through rates that look great until you realize none of these clicks are turning into leads.\n\nAll those are reasons to question PMax campaigns for lead gen, but that’s a decision every marketer has to make.\n\nAdvanced Google Ads Settings To Tackle Click Fraud\n\nIf the basics are implemented but there is still a higher amount of suspected click fraud, advanced solutions need to be implemented.\n\nBesides excluding suspicious IP addresses, you can also build negative audiences.\n\nThe idea is to have a second success page for your lead generation form and only forward potential bots or fake sign-ups to this page.\n\nTo achieve that, your website needs to evaluate potential bots live during the sign-up process.\n\nYou can then setup a dedicated “bot pixel” on the second success page in order to send data of this audience to Google.\n\nOnce enough data is retrieved, you can exclude this audience from your campaigns. This approach is a little trickier to implement but is worth the effort as those audience signals are of high quality if enough data is supplied.\n\nMake sure to only fire the “bot pixel” on the special success page and only there, otherwise you run the risk of mixing your audiences which would render the system useless.\n\nFiltering Fake Leads With Conditional Triggers\n\nAnother tracking-based strategy is to set up condition-based conversion tracking. Combined with hidden form fields, you can modify the conversion trigger not to send data if the hidden field was filled.\n\nIn that scenario, you would filter out bots from conversion tracking, sending back only real conversion to your campaign, and therefore, also training the Google algorithm and bidding strategy only on real data.\n\nYou eliminate a majority of fake leads and traffic with this setup.\n\nMaking Sign-Ups More Challenging To Improve Lead Quality\n\nAnother advanced strategy is to make the sign-up process a lot harder.\n\nTests have shown that much longer forms are not finished by bots because they are usually trained on simpler and shorter forms, which require only mail, name, phone, and address.\n\nAsking specific questions and working with dropdowns can dramatically increase the lead quality. It should be noted, however, that longer forms can also hurt the valid signup rate, which is a risk you want to take if you have to deal with bot and fraud traffic.\n\nA fitting case was a car dealer I worked with. They had a form where people could offer their cars for sale and retrieve a price estimate.\n\nA short form had almost three times the signup rate than before, but it turned out later that a lot of them were spam signups or even very low-qualified leads.\n\nA shorter form leads to more spam because it’s easy to sign up. After switching to a longer form, the signups dropped, but quality increased drastically.\n\nAlmost 20 fields long, and potential clients had to upload pictures of their car.\n\nIt took a few minutes to finish the signup, but those who did were committed to doing business and open to discussing the sale, which also made it easier for the salespeople to follow up properly.\n\nA Hard Truth About Lead Fraud\n\nLet’s be honest: You can’t completely stop lead fraud. It’s like shoplifting in retail – you can reduce it, you can catch it faster, but you can’t eliminate it entirely.\n\nThe fraudsters are always getting smarter, and for every security measure we create, they’ll eventually find a way around it.\n\nBut here’s the good news: You don’t need perfect protection. What you need is a balanced approach that catches most of the bad leads while letting good ones through easily.\n\nThink of it like running a store: You want security, but not so much that it scares away real customers.\n\nThe key is to layer your defenses. Use click fraud tools as your first line of defense, add smart form validation as your second, and keep a human eye on patterns as your final check.\n\nWill some fake leads still get through? Yes. But if you can stop 90% of the fraud, you’re winning the battle.\n\nRemember: Perfect is the enemy of good. Focus on making fraud expensive and difficult for the bad actors, while keeping your lead generation process smooth and simple for real prospects. That’s how you win in the long run.\n\nMore Resources:\n\nFeatured Image: BestForBest/Shutterstock"}

Yet, because of it’s ease and simplicity to just “get something working”, it’s also one of the most underappreciated.\n\nIf you search for Top 10 Advanced Python Tricks on Google or any other search engine, you’ll find tons of blogs or LinkedIn articles going over trivial (but still useful) things like generators or tuples .\n\nHowever, as someone who’s written Python for the past 12 years, I’ve come across a lot of really interesting, underrated, unique, or (as some might say) “un-pythonic” tricks to really level up what Python can do.\n\nThat’s why I decided to compile the top 14 of said features alongside examples and additional resources if you want to dive deeper into any of them.\n\nThese tips & tricks were originally featured as part of a 14-day series on X/Twitter between March 1st and March 14th (pi-day, hence why there are 14 topics in the article).

Typing Overloads\n\n@overload is a decorator from Python’s typing module that lets you define multiple signatures for the same function. Each overload tells the type checker exactly what types to expect when specific parameters are passed in.\n\nNote that Python’s @overload works differently than some other languages. In Python, @overload tells the type checker to expect different signatures for the same function. It doesn’t actually define multiple versions of the function itself, unlike Java or C++.\n\nFor example, the code below dictates that only list[str] can be returned if mode=split , and only str can be returned if mode=upper . (The Literal type also forces mode to be either one of split or upper )\n\nfrom typing import Literal, overload @overload def transform (data: str, mode: Literal[ \"split\" ]) -> list[str]: ... @overload def transform (data: str, mode: Literal[ \"upper\" ]) -> str: ... def transform (data: str, mode: Literal[ \"split\" , \"upper\" ]) -> list[str] | str: if mode == \"split\" : return data . split() else : return data . upper() split_words = transform( \"hello world\" , \"split\" ) # Return type is list[str] split_words[ 0 ] # Type checker is happy upper_words = transform( \"hello world\" , \"upper\" ) # Return type is str upper_words . lower() # Type checker is happy upper_words . append( \"!\" ) # Cannot access attribute \"append\" for \"str\"\n\nOverloads can do more than just change return type based on arguments! In another example, we use typing overloads to ensure that either one of id OR username are passed in, but never both.\n\n@overload def get_user (id: int = ... , username: None = None ) -> User: ... @overload def get_user (id: None = None , username: str = ... ) -> User: ... def get_user (id: int | None = None , username: str | None = None ) -> User: ... get_user(id = 1 ) # Works! get_user(username = \"John\" ) # Works! get_user(id = 1 , username = \"John\" ) # No overloads for \"get_user\" match the provided arguments\n\nThe ... is a special value often used in overloads to indicate that a parameter is optional, but still requires a value.\n\n✨ Quick bonus trick: As you probably saw, Python also has support for String Literals. These help assert that only specific string values can be passed to a parameter, giving you even more type safety. Think of them like a lightweight form of Enums!\n\ndef set_color (color: Literal[ \"red\" , \"blue\" , \"green\" ]) -> None : ... set_color( \"red\" ) set_color( \"blue\" ) set_color( \"green\" ) set_color( \"fuchsia\" ) # Argument of type \"Literal['fuchsia']\" cannot be assigned to parameter \"color\"\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n2. Keyword-only and Positional-only Arguments\n\nBy default, both required parameters and optional parameters can be assigned with both positional and keyword syntax. However, what if you don’t want that to happen? Keyword-only and Positional-only args let you control that.\n\ndef foo (a, b, / , c, d, * , e, f): # ^ ^ # Ever seen these before? ...\n\n* (asterisk) marks keyword-only parameters. Arguments after * must be passed as keyword arguments.\n\n# KW+POS | KW ONLY # vv | vv def foo (a, * , b): ... # == ALLOWED == foo(a = 1 , b = 2 ) # All keyword foo( 1 , b = 2 ) # Half positional, half keyword # == NOT ALLOWED == foo( 1 , 2 ) # Cannot use positional for keyword-only parameter # ^\n\n/ (forward slash) marks positional-only parameters. Arguments before / must be passed positionally and cannot be used as keyword arguments.\n\n# POS ONLY | KW POS # vv | vv def bar (a, / , b): ... # == ALLOWED == bar( 1 , 2 ) # All positional bar( 1 , b = 2 ) # Half positional, half keyword # == NOT ALLOWED == bar(a = 1 , b = 2 ) # Cannot use keyword for positional-only parameter # ^\n\nKeyword-only and Positional-only arguments are especially helpful for API developers to enforce how their arguments may be used and passed in.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n3. Future Annotations\n\nA quick history lesson into Python’s typing:\n\nThis is less of a “Python Feature” and more of a history lesson into Python’s type system, and what from __future__ import annotations does if you ever encounter it in production code.\n\nPython’s typing system started off as a hack. Function annotation syntax was first introduced with PEP 3107 back in Python 3.0 as purely an extra way to decorate functions with no actual type-checking functionality.\n\nProper specifications for type annotations were later added in Python 3.5 through PEP 484, but they were designed to be evaluated at bound / definition time. This worked great for simple cases, but it increasingly caused headaches with one type of problem: forward references.\n\nThis meant that forward references (using a type before it gets defined) required falling back to string literals, making the code less elegant and more error-prone.\n\n# This won't work class Foo : def action (self) -> Foo: # The `-> Foo` return annotation is evaluated immediately during definition, # but the class `Foo` is not yet fully defined at that point, # causing a NameError during type checking. ...\n\n# This is the workaround -> Using string types class Bar : def action (self) -> \"Bar\" : # Workaround with string literals, but ugly and error-prone ...\n\nIntroduced as a PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal), PEP 563: Postponed Evaluation of Annotations aimed to fix this by changing when type annotations were evaluated. Instead of evaluating annotations at definition time, PEP 563 “string-ifies” types behind the scenes and postpones evaluation until they’re actually needed, typically during static analysis. This allows for cleaner forward references without explicitly defining string literals and reduces the runtime overhead of type annotations.\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations class Foo : def bar (self) -> Foo: # Works now! ...\n\nSo what was the problem?\n\nFor type checkers, this change is largely transparent. But because PEP 563 implements this by essentially treating all types as strings behind the scenes, anything that relies on accessing return types at runtime (i.e., ORMs, serialization libraries, validators, dependency injectors, etc.) will have compatibility issues with the new setup.\n\nThat’s why even after ten years after the initial proposal, modern Python (3.13 as of writing this) still relies on the same hacked-together type system introduced in Python 3.5.\n\n# ===== Regular Python Typing ===== def foobar () -> int: return 1 ret_type = foobar . __annotations__ . get( \"return\" ) ret_type # Returns: <class 'int'> new_int = ret_type()\n\n# ===== With Postponed Evaluation ===== from __future__ import annotations def foobar () -> int: return 1 ret_type = foobar . __annotations__ . get( \"return\" ) ret_type # \"int\" (str) new_int = ret_type() # TypeError: 'str' object is not callable\n\nRecently, PEP 649 proposes a new method to handle Python function and class annotations through deferred, or “lazy,” evaluation. Instead of evaluating annotations at the time of function or class definition, as is traditionally done, this approach delays their computation until they are actually accessed.\n\nThis is achieved by compiling the annotation expressions into a separate function, stored in a special __annotate__ attribute. When the __annotations__ attribute is accessed for the first time, this function is invoked to compute and cache the annotations, making them readily available for subsequent accesses.\n\n# Example code from the PEP 649 proposal class function : # __annotations__ on a function object is already a # \"data descriptor\" in Python, we're just changing # what it does @property def __annotations__ (self): return self . __annotate__() # ... def annotate_foo (): return { 'x' : int, 'y' : MyType, 'return' : float} def foo (x = 3 , y = \"abc\" ): ... foo . __annotate__ = annotate_foo class MyType : ... foo_y_annotation = foo . __annotations__[ 'y' ]\n\nThis deferred evaluation strategy addresses issues like forward references and circular dependencies, as annotations are only evaluated when needed. Moreover, it enhances performance by avoiding the immediate computation of annotations that might not be used, and maintains full semantic information, supporting introspection and runtime type-checking tools.\n\n✨ Bonus Fact: Since Python 3.11, Python now supports a “Self” type (PEP 673) that allows for proper typing of methods that return instances of their own class, solving this particular example of self-referential return types.\n\nfrom typing import Self class Foo : def bar (self) -> Self: ...\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n4. Generics\n\nDid you know that Python has Generics? In fact, since Python 3.12, a newer, sleeker, and sexier syntax for Generics was introduced.\n\nclass KVStore [K: str | int, V]: def __init__ (self) -> None : self . store: dict[K, V] = {} def get (self, key: K) -> V: return self . store[key] def set (self, key: K, value: V) -> None : self . store[key] = value kv = KVStore[str, int]() kv . set( \"one\" , 1 ) kv . set( \"two\" , 2 ) kv . set( \"three\" , 3 )\n\nPython 3.5 initially introduced Generics through the TypeVar syntax. However, PEP 695 for Python 3.12 revamped type annotations with native syntax for generics, type aliases, and more.\n\n# OLD SYNTAX - Python 3.5 to 3.11 from typing import Generic, TypeVar UnBounded = TypeVar( \"UnBounded\" ) Bounded = TypeVar( \"Bounded\" , bound = int) Constrained = TypeVar( \"Constrained\" , int, float) class Foo (Generic[UnBounded, Bounded, Constrained]): def __init__ (self, x: UnBounded, y: Bounded, z: Constrained) -> None : self . x = x self . y = y self . z = z\n\n# NEW SYNTAX - Python 3.12+ class Foo [UnBounded, Bounded: int, Constrained: int | float]: def __init__ (self, x: UnBounded, y: Bounded, z: Constrained) -> None : self . x = x self . y = y self . z = z\n\nThis change also introduces an even more powerful version of variadic generics. Meaning you can have an arbitrary number of type parameters for complex data structures and operations.\n\nclass Tuple [ * Ts]: def __init__ (self, * args: * Ts) -> None : self . values = args # Works with any number of types! pair = Tuple[str, int]( \"hello\" , 42 ) triple = Tuple[str, int, bool]( \"world\" , 100 , True )\n\nFinally, as part of the 3.12 typing changes, Python also introduced a new concise syntax for type aliases!\n\n# OLD SYNTAX - Python 3.5 to 3.9 from typing import NewType Vector = NewType( \"Vector\" , list[float])\n\n# OLD-ish SYNTAX - Python 3.10 to 3.11 from typing import TypeAlias Vector: TypeAlias = list[float]\n\n# NEW SYNTAX - Python 3.12+ type Vector = list[float]\n\nIt’s important to note that NewType and TypeAlias (including the new type syntax) are slightly different! NewType creates a subtype that is not equivalent to its base type, whereas TypeAlias assigns an alternative name for an existing type. from typing import TypeAlias type NewInt = int AliasInt: TypeAlias = int NewInt == int # False, not equivalent AliasInt == int # True, equivalent\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n5. Protocols\n\nOne of Python’s major features (and also major complaints) is its support for Duck Typing. There’s a saying that goes:\n\n“If it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.”\n\nHowever, that raises the question: How do you type duck typing?\n\nclass Duck : def quack (self): print( 'Quack!' ) class Person : def quack (self): print( \"I'm quacking!\" ) class Dog : def bark (self): print( 'Woof!' ) def run_quack (obj): obj . quack() run_quack(Duck()) # Works! run_quack(Person()) # Works! run_quack(Dog()) # Fails with AttributeError\n\nThat’s where Protocols come in. Protocols (also known as Structural Subtyping) are typing classes in Python defining the structure or behavior that classes can follow without the use of interfaces or inheritance.\n\nfrom typing import Protocol class Quackable (Protocol): def quack (self) -> None : ... # The ellipsis indicates this is just a method signature class Duck : def quack (self): print( 'Quack!' ) class Dog : def bark (self): print( 'Woof!' ) def run_quack (obj: Quackable): obj . quack() run_quack(Duck()) # Works! run_quack(Dog()) # Fails during TYPE CHECKING (and runtime)\n\nIn essence, Protocols check what your object can do, not what it is. They simply state that as long as an object implements certain methods or behaviors, it qualifies, regardless of its actual type or inheritance.\n\n✨ Additional quick tip: Add the @runtime_checkable decorator if you want isinstance() checks to work alongside your Protocols!\n\n@runtime_checkable class Drawable (Protocol): def draw (self) -> None : ...\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n6. Context Managers\n\nContext Managers are objects that define the methods: __enter__() and __exit__() . The __enter__() method runs when you enter the with block, and the __exit__() method runs when you leave it (even if an exception occurs).\n\nContextlib simplifies this process by wrapping all that boilerplate code in a single easy-to-use decorator.\n\n# OLD SYNTAX - Traditional OOP-style context manager class retry : def __enter__ (self): print( \"Entering Context\" ) def __exit__ (self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb): print( \"Exiting Context\" )\n\n# NEW SYNTAX - New contextlib-based context manager import contextlib @contextlib.contextmanager def retry (): print( \"Entering Context\" ) yield print( \"Exiting Context\" )\n\nTo create your own, write a function with the @contextlib.contextmanager decorator. Add setup code before yield , cleanup code after it. Any variables on yield will be passed in as additional context. That’s it.\n\nThe yield statement instructs the context manager to pause your function and lets content within the with block run.\n\nimport contextlib @contextlib.contextmanager def context (): # Setup code here setup() yield ( ... ) # Any variables you want to be passed to the with block # Teardown code here takedown()\n\nThe real power with contextlib comes from its exception handling and state management. For example, the same logic with this following function:\n\n@contextlib.contextmanager def handle_file (path: str): try : with open(path, 'w' ) as f: f . write( 'Hello, world!' ) yield f f . write( 'Goodbye, world!' ) except Exception as e: raise CustomFileOpenError() from e\n\nUsing raw __enter__ and __exit__ methods would look like this:\n\nclass handle_file : def __init__ (self, path: str): self . path = path self . file = None def __enter__ (self): try : self . file = open(self . path, 'w' ) self . file . write( 'Hello, world!' ) return self . file except Exception as e: raise CustomFileOpenError() from e def __exit__ (self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb): try : # Only write \"Goodbye, world!\" if no exception occurred during the yield if exc_type is None : self . file . write( 'Goodbye, world!' ) finally : if self . file: self . file . close() # Not suppressing any exceptions return None\n\nBoth are functionally identical, but the @contextmanager decorator lets us write more readable and maintainable code by handling all the boilerplate for us.\n\n(No need to deal with exec_type , exec_val , exec_tb , etc!)\n\n✨ Bonus Tip: raise ... from ... is also a neat Python feature that allows you to chain exceptions together! For example, try : raise ValueError () except Exception as e: raise NameError () from e returns an exception like: Traceback (most recent call last): File \"...\", line ..., in ... ValueError The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception: Traceback (most recent call last): File \"...\", line ..., in ... NameError\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n7. Structural Pattern Matching\n\nIntroduced in Python 3.10, Structural Pattern Matching gives Python developers a powerful alternative to traditional conditional logic. At its most basic, the syntax looks like this:\n\nmatch value: case pattern1: # code if value matches pattern1 case pattern2: # code if value matches pattern2 case _: # wildcard case (default)\n\nThe real power comes with destructuring! Match patterns break down complex data structures and extract values in a single step.\n\n# Destructuring and matching tuples match point: case ( 0 , 0 ): return \"Origin\" case ( 0 , y): return f \"Y-axis at { y } \" case (x, 0 ): return f \"X-axis at { x } \" case (x, y): return f \"Point at ( { x } , { y } )\"\n\n# Using OR pattern (|) to match multiple patterns match day: case ( \"Monday\" | \"Tuesday\" | \"Wednesday\" | \"Thursday\" | \"Friday\" ): return \"Weekday\" case \"Saturday\" | \"Sunday\" : return \"Weekend\"\n\n# Guard clauses with inline 'if' statements match temperature: case temp if temp < 0 : return \"Freezing\" case temp if temp < 20 : return \"Cold\" case temp if temp < 30 : return \"Warm\" case _: return \"Hot\"\n\n# Capture entire collections using asterisk (*) match numbers: case [f]: return f \"First: { f } \" case [f, l]: return f \"First: { f } , Last: { l } \" case [f, * m, l]: return f \"First: { f } , Middle: { ', ' . join(m) } , Last: { l } \" case []: return \"Empty list\"\n\nYou can also combine match-case with other Python features like walrus operators to create even more powerful patterns.\n\n# Check if a packet is valid or not packet: list[int] = [ 0x01 , 0x02 , 0x03 , 0x04 , 0x05 , 0x06 , 0x07 ] match packet: case [c1, c2, * data, footer] if ( # Deconstruct packet into header, data, and footer (checksum := c1 + c2) == sum(data) and # Check that the checksum is correct len(data) == footer # Check that the data length is correct ): print( f \"Packet received: { data } (Checksum: { checksum } )\" ) case [c1, c2, * data]: # Failure case where structure is correct but checksum is wrong print( f \"Packet received: { data } (Checksum Failed)\" ) case [_, * __]: # Failure case where packet is too short print( \"Invalid packet length\" ) case []: # Failure case where packet is empty print( \"Empty packet\" ) case _: # Failure case where packet is invalid print( \"Invalid packet\" )\n\nNOTE: This is not the cleanest example, but instead more of a demo to show how you can use match-case with other Python features to create more powerful patterns.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n8. Python Slots\n\nSlots are a way to potentially speed up the creation and access of any Python class.\n\nTLDR: They define a fixed set of attributes for classes, optimizing and speeding up accesses during runtime.\n\nclass Person : __slots__ = ( 'name' , 'age' ) def __init__ (self, name, age): self . name = name self . age = age\n\nUnder the hood, Python classes store instance attributes in an internal dictionary called __dict__ , meaning a hash table lookup is required each time you want to access a value.\n\nIn contrast, __slots__ uses an array-like structure where attributes can be looked up in true O(1) time, bringing a minor overall speed bump to Python.\n\n# Without __slots__ class FooBar : def __init__ (self): self . a = 1 self . b = 2 self . c = 3 f = FooBar() print(f . __dict__) # {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n\n# With __slots__ class FooBar : __slots__ = ( 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ) def __init__ (self): self . a = 1 self . b = 2 self . c = 3 f = FooBar() print(f . __dict__) # AttributeError print(f . __slots__) # ('a', 'b', 'c')\n\nThere is still debate about whether __slots__ is worth using, as it complicates class definitions with very marginal or no performance benefits at all. However, it is a useful tool to have in your arsenal if you ever need it.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n9. Python Nitpicks\n\nThis is not a Python “feature” or “tip” per se, but instead a handful of quick syntax tips to really clean up your Python codebase. As someone who’s seen a lot of Python code.\n\n9.1 For-else statements\n\nIf you ever need to check if a for loop completes without a break, for-else statements are a great way to accomplish this without using a temporary variable.\n\n# ===== Don't write this ===== found_server = False # Keep track of whether we found a server for server in servers: if server . check_availability(): logger . info( f \"Found server: { server } \" ) # Adding some side-effects here primary_server = server found_server = True # Set the flag to True break if not found_server: logger . info( \"No server found. Using backup server.\" ) # Use the backup server if no server was found primary_server = backup_server # Continue execution with whatever server we found deploy_application(primary_server)\n\n# ===== Write this instead ===== for server in servers: if server . check_availability(): logger . info( f \"Found server: { server } \" ) # Adding some side-effects here primary_server = server break else : # Use the backup server if no server was found logger . info( \"No server found. Using backup server.\" ) primary_server = backup_server # Continue execution with whatever server we found deploy_application(primary_server)\n\n9.2 Walrus Operator\n\nIf you need to define and evaluate a variable all in one expression, the Walrus Operator (new in Python 3.8 with PEP 572) is a quick way to accomplish just that.\n\nWalrus operators are really useful for using a value right after checking if it is not None !\n\n# ===== Don't write this ===== response = pattern . search(line) if response: print( 'You pressed:' , response) else : print( 'You pressed nothing' )\n\n# ===== Write this instead ===== if response := pattern . search(line): print( 'You pressed:' , response) else : print( 'You pressed nothing' )\n\n9.3 Short Circuit Evaluation\n\nShort-circuit Evaluation is a shortcut for getting the “next available” or “next truthy” value in a list of expressions. It turns out you can simply chain or statements!\n\n# ===== Don't write this ===== username, full_name, first_name = get_user_info() if username is not None : display_name = username elif full_name is not None : display_name = full_name elif first_name is not None : display_name = first_name else : display_name = \"Anonymous\"\n\n# ===== Write this instead ===== username, full_name, first_name = get_user_info() display_name = username or full_name or first_name or \"Anonymous\"\n\nNOTE: As some readers have pointed out, there are some hidden footguns with evaluating variables as booleans! Empty strings, zeros, and empty lists are all considered “falsy” values, which means you need to be extra careful when checking explicitly for None or 0 . # Zero is considered falsy, so it gets skipped even when it's a valid value user_data = { \"name\" : \"Alice\" , \"age\" : 0 } age = user_data . get( \"age\" ) or \"Unknown\" print( f \"User age: { age } \" ) # \"User age: Unknown\"\n\n9.4 Operator Chaining\n\nFinally, Python lets you chain comparison operators together to shorten up integer range comparisons, making them more readable than the equivalent boolean expressions.\n\n# ===== Don't write this ===== if 0 < x and x < 10 : print( \"x is between 0 and 10\" )\n\n# ===== Write this instead ===== if 0 < x < 10 : # Instead of if 0 < x and x < 10 print( \"x is between 0 and 10\" )\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n10. Advanced f-string String Formatting\n\nPython’s f-strings are no secret by now. Introduced in Python 3.6 with PEP 498, they are a better, cleaner, faster, and safer method of interpolating variables, objects, and expressions into strings.\n\nBut did you know there is more to f-strings than just inserting variables? There exists a hidden formatting syntax called the Format Mini-Language that allows you to have much greater control over string formatting.\n\nprint( f \" { ' [ Run Status ] ' : =^50 } \" ) print( f \"[ { time : %H:%M:%S } ] Training Run { run_id =} status: { progress : .1% } \" ) print( f \"Summary: { total_samples : , } samples processed\" ) print( f \"Accuracy: { accuracy : .4f } | Loss: { loss : #.3g } \" ) print( f \"Memory: { memory / 1e9 : +.2f } GB\" )\n\nOutput:\n\n=================== [ Run Status ] =================== [11:16:37] Training Run run_id=42 status: 87.4% Summary: 12,345,678 samples processed Accuracy: 0.9876 | Loss: 0.0123 Memory: +2.75 GB\n\nYou can do things like enable debug expressions, apply number formatting (similar to str.format ), add string padding, format datetime objects, and more! All within f-string format specifiers.\n\nRegular f-strings\n\nprint( f \"Hello { item } !\" )\n\nHello World!\n\nDebug Expressions\n\nprint( f \" { name =} , { age =} \" )\n\nname='Claude', age=3\n\nNumber Formatting\n\nprint( f \"Pi: { pi : .2f } \" ) print( f \"Avogadro: { avogadro : .2e } \" ) print( f \"Big Number: { big_num : , } \" ) print( f \"Hex: { num : #0x } \" ) print( f \"Number: { num : 09 } \" )\n\nPi: 3.14 Avogadro: 6.02e+23 Big Number: 1,000,000 Hex: 0x1a4 Number: 000000420\n\nString Padding\n\nprint( f \"Left: | { word : <10 } |\" ) print( f \"Right: | { word : >10 } |\" ) print( f \"Center: | { word : ^10 } |\" ) print( f \"Center *: | { word : *^10 } |\" )\n\nLeft: |Python | Right: | Python| Center: | Python | Center *: |**Python**|\n\nprint( f \"Date: { now : %Y-%m-%d } \" ) print( f \"Time: { now : %H:%M:%S } \" )\n\nDate: 2025-03-10 Time: 14:30:59\n\nPercentage Formatting\n\nprint( f \"Progress: { progress : .1% } \" )\n\nProgress: 75.0%\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n11. Cache / lru_cache\n\nYou can use the built-in @cache decorator to dramatically speed up recursive functions and expensive calculations! (which superseded @lru_cache in Python 3.9!)\n\nfrom functools import cache @cache def fib (n): return n if n < 2 else fib(n - 1 ) + fib(n - 2 )\n\nSince Python 3.2, @lru_cache was introduced as part of the functools module for quick & clean function memoization. Starting with Python 3.9, @cache was added for the same effect with less code. lru_cache still exists if you want explicit control of the cache size.\n\nFIB_CACHE = {} # With Manual Caching :( def fib (n): if n in FIB_CACHE: return FIB_CACHE[n] if n <= 2 : return 1 FIB_CACHE[n] = fib(n - 1 ) + fib(n - 2 ) return FIB_CACHE[n]\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache # Same code with lru_cache :) @lru_cache (maxsize = None ) def fib (n): return n if n < 2 else fib(n - 1 ) + fib(n - 2 )\n\nfrom functools import cache # Same code with new Python 3.9's cache :D @cache def fib (n): return n if n < 2 else fib(n - 1 ) + fib(n - 2 )\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n12. Python Futures\n\nDid you know that Python has native Promise -like concurrency control?\n\nfrom concurrent.futures import Future # Manually create a Future Object future = Future() # Set its result whenever you want future . set_result( \"Hello from the future!\" ) # Get the result print(future . result()) # \"Hello from the future!\"\n\nPython’s concurrent.futures module gives you direct control over async operations, just like JS Promises. For example, they let you attach callbacks that run when the result is ready (just like JS’s .then() ).\n\nfrom concurrent.futures import Future future = Future() # Add callbacks BEFORE or AFTER completion! future . add_done_callback( lambda f: print( f \"Got: { f . result() } \" )) future . set_result( \"Async result\" ) # Prints: \"Got: Async result\" future . add_done_callback( lambda f: print( f \"After: { f . result() } \" )) # Prints: \"After: Async result\"\n\nPython Futures also come with primitives to handle exceptions, set timeouts, or stop tasks completely.\n\nfrom concurrent.futures import Future import time , threading # Create and manage a future manually future = Future() # Background task function def background_task (): time . sleep( 2 ) future . set_result( \"Done!\" ) thread = threading . Thread(target = background_task) thread . daemon = True thread . start() # Try all control operations print( f \"Cancelled: { future . cancel() } \" ) # Likely False if started try : # Wait at most 0.5 seconds result = future . result(timeout = 0.5 ) except TimeoutError : print( \"Timed out!\" ) # Create failed future err_future = Future() err_future . set_exception( ValueError ( \"Failed\" )) print( f \"Has error: { bool(err_future . exception()) } \" )\n\nJust like modern JS, the asyncio module has its own Future that works seamlessly with Python’s async/await syntax:\n\nimport asyncio async def main (): future = asyncio . Future() # Set result after delay asyncio . create_task(set_after_delay(future)) # Await just like a JS Promise! result = await future print(result) # \"Worth the wait!\" async def set_after_delay (future): await asyncio . sleep( 1 ) future . set_result( \"Worth the wait!\" ) asyncio . run(main())\n\nFinally, for CPU or I/O bound tasks, Python’s ThreadPoolExecutor can automatically create and manage futures for you.\n\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor import time def slow_task (): time . sleep( 1 ) return \"Done!\" with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor: # Returns a Future immediately future = executor . submit(slow_task) # Do other work while waiting... print( \"Working...\" ) # Get result when needed print(future . result())\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n13. Proxy Properties\n\nDid you know you can make class attributes act as BOTH methods AND properties?!? This isn’t a built-in feature of Python, but instead a demonstration of what you can do with clever use of Python’s dunder (magic) methods and descriptors.\n\n(Note that this is very much an example implementation and should not be used in production)\n\nfrom typing import Callable, Generic, TypeVar, ParamSpec, Self P = ParamSpec( \"P\" ) R = TypeVar( \"R\" ) T = TypeVar( \"T\" ) class ProxyProperty (Generic[P, R]): func: Callable[P, R] instance: object def __init__ (self, func: Callable[P, R]) -> None : self . func = func def __get__ (self, instance: object, _ = None ) -> Self: self . instance = instance return self def __call__ (self, * args: P . args, ** kwargs: P . kwargs) -> R: return self . func(self . instance, * args, ** kwargs) def __repr__ (self) -> str: return self . func(self . instance) def proxy_property (func: Callable[P, R]) -> ProxyProperty[P, R]: return ProxyProperty(func) class Container : @proxy_property def value (self, val: int = 5 ) -> str: return f \"The value is: { val } \" # Example usage c = Container() print(c . value) # Returns: The value is: 5 print(c . value( 7 )) # Returns: The value is: 7\n\nHow does this work under the hood? It comes down to Python’s Descriptor Protocol:\n\nThe __get__ method transforms the ProxyProperty object into a descriptor. When you access c.value , Python calls __get__ which returns self (the descriptor instance). The __repr__ method handles property access (returning default values). The __call__ method handles method calls with parameters.\n\nThis creates a dual-purpose attribute that can be both read directly AND called like a function!\n\nThe benefit of this class is that it allows you to create intuitive APIs where a property might need configuration, or properties that should have sensible defaults but still allow for customization.\n\nIf you want to look at a proper production-ready implementation of proxy properties, check out Codegen’s implementation of ProxyProperty here: codegen/src/codegen/sdk/_proxy.py\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n14. Metaclasses\n\nFinally, introducing one of Python’s most powerful yet mysterious features: Metaclasses\n\nclass MyMetaclass (type): def __new__ (cls, name, bases, namespace): # Magic happens here return super() . __new__ (cls, name, bases, namespace) class MyClass (metaclass = MyMetaclass): pass obj = MyClass()\n\nClasses in Python aren’t just blueprints for objects. They’re objects too! And every object needs a class that created it. So what creates class objects? Metaclasses.\n\nBy default, Python uses the type metaclass to create all classes. For example, these two are equivalent to each other:\n\n# Create a MyClass object class MyClass : ... obj = MyClass() # Also creates a MyClass object obj2 = type( \"MyClass\" , (), {})\n\nTo break down what those arguments mean, here is an example that creates a class with an attribute x and a method say_hi , that also subclasses off object .\n\n# type( # name, # bases, # attributes # ) CustomClass = type( 'CustomClass' , (object,), { 'x' : 5 , 'say_hi' : lambda self: 'Hello!' } ) obj = CustomClass() print(obj . x) # 5 print(obj . say_hi()) # Hello!\n\nIn essence, Metaclasses let you customize and modify these arguments during class creation. For example, here is a metaclass that doubles every integer attribute for a class:\n\nclass DoubleAttrMeta (type): def __new__ (cls, name, bases, namespace): new_namespace = {} for key, val in namespace . items(): if isinstance(val, int): val *= 2 new_namespace[key] = val return super() . __new__ (cls, name, bases, new_namespace) class MyClass (metaclass = DoubleAttrMeta): x = 5 y = 10 print(MyClass . x) # 10 print(MyClass . y) # 20\n\nHere is another example of a metaclass that registers every class created into a registry.\n\n# ===== Metaclass Solution ===== class RegisterMeta (type): registry = [] def __new__ (mcs, name, bases, attrs): cls = super() . __new__ (mcs, name, bases, attrs) mcs . registry . append(cls) return cls\n\nThe problem is, decorators could achieve this same goal without the use of black magic (and it’s often cleaner too).\n\n# ===== Decorator Solution ===== def register (cls): registry . append(cls) return cls @register class MyClass : pass\n\nAnd that kind of brings to light the biggest problem with metaclasses:\n\nAlmost 100% of the time, you will never need to touch them.\n\nIn your day-to-day development, 99% of your code won’t ever hit a use case where metaclasses could be useful. And of that 1%, 95% of those cases could just be solved with regular decorators, dunder methods, or just plain inheritance.\n\nThat’s why there is that one famous Python quote that goes:\n\nMetaclasses are deeper magic than 99% of users should ever worry about. If you wonder whether you need them, you don’t. - Tim Peters\n\nBut if you are that 1% which has a unique enough problem that only metaclasses can solve, they are a powerful tool that lets you tinker with the internals of the Python object system.\n\nAs for some real-world examples of metaclasses: Python’s “ABC” implementation uses metaclasses to implement abstract classes.\n\nPython’s “Enum” implementation uses it to create enumeration types.\n\nA bunch of 3rd party libraries like Django, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Pytest use metaclasses for a variety of purposes.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFin\n\nAnd that’s it folks! 14 of some of the most interesting & underrated Python features that I’ve encountered in my Python career.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, shoot me a quick message as to which ones you’ve seen before and which ones you haven’t! I’d love to hear from you.\n\nHappy Python-ing, y’all 🐍!"}

Really, you need to look at everything — including bills.\n\nBills are often seen as necessary and fixed costs, but you can often negotiate them to better suit your budget.\n\nMedical bills can be the easiest to negotiate\n\nValerie Rivera, CFP® professional and founder of FirstGen Wealth , says medical bills can be the easiest to negotiate.\n\n\"A lot of times, medical bills, if they're with a hospital, for example, they aren't building up interest along the way,\" says Rivera.\n\nChristopher Stroup, CFP® professional, founder, and president of Silicon Beach Financial agrees that medical bills can be easier to negotiate, although you have to make the call, or maybe even multiple calls, to lower or adjust costs.\n\n\"I found that for those who are willing to put in the time to potentially negotiate or renegotiate medical bills, they can actually find some savings, which they would have never expected,\" says Stroup.\n\nBesides medical bills, you might be also able to review credit card interest, insurance policies, subscriptions, or utility bills to see if there's any wiggle room.\n\nTips when negotiating a bill\n\nNegotiating a bill requires you to put in some work. First, you'll need to review your bill and ensure that the services listed are correct. Common billing errors include having services listed that you didn't get or seeing duplicate charges.\n\nWhen you make the call, Stroup says, \"Be polite, but be direct in terms of what you're seeking or what you're questioning in terms of your bill. Then, use certain phrases in terms of the care that you were expecting and that you believed you received versus what you actually saw them bill you for.\"\n\nMake sure you understand the new terms you're agreeing to. You should know the new payment schedule, if there are any penalties, and when you'll receive the final bill, says Rivera.\n\nEven if you can't negotiate a lower bill, you still may find it helpful to call to make other types of adjustments.\n\n\"It may not be a lower bill, but it might be the ability to make smaller payments along the way,\" says Rivera.\n\nAlternative strategies for lowering bills\n\nResearch competitor offers\n\nFind out what competitors are offering to see if your services are still the best fit. You might realize that there is better value elsewhere. You might also use it as a way to negotiate for a lower bill with your existing provider.\n\nUse a bill negotiation service\n\nThere are services you can use to identify and potentially lower some bills, such as internet or phone services. Rocket Money and Billshark are a few examples.\n\nKeep in mind that Rocket Money charges you a percentage (you can choose any amount from 35% to 60%) of whatever it will save you for the year for its bill negotiation feature. Billshark charges 40% of what it will save you for that year.\n\nDeclutter Your Finances with Rocket Money Losing track of your monthly expenses? Rocket Money app can help you take control by canceling unused subscriptions, tracking your spending, and organizing your financial life — all in one app. Consider it decluttering your junk drawer, but for your bank account. Clean up your finances, reduce money stress, and start saving smarter with Rocket Money app.\n\nMake lifestyle adjustments to indirectly impact your bill\n\nYou also might be able to lower some bills indirectly by making adjustments, such as switching to energy-efficient light bulbs.\n\n\"Utility bills can be fixed spending, but there are ways to make your house more energy efficient and indirectly cut spending. Maybe you can consider — which comes at its own costs — replacing your windows if you have old windows, and maybe just start with doing an energy audit of your house, says Jing Zheng, CFP® professional and founder of Neat Financial Planning.\n\nCut services you no longer want\n\nPerhaps you review your bank statement and realize you have some subscriptions you aren't using, or you notice a bill for something you thought you had canceled. You might find it's best to cut expenses entirely.\n\nAfter you make adjustments in your spending, it can be helpful to track your expenses to see where your money is going.\n\nMany of the best budgeting apps let you link bank accounts, credit cards, and investment accounts so you can get a full picture of your financial situation. You could also opt for a spreadsheet or use some of the best personal finance software."}

The 2024 Public Access Policy, originally slated to go into effect on December 31, 2025, will now be effective as of July 1, 2025.\n\nTo be clear, maximum transparency regarding the research we support is our default position. Since the release of NIH’s 2008 Public Access Policy, more than 1.5 million articles reporting on NIH-supported research have been made freely available to the public through PubMed Central. While the 2008 Policy allowed for an up to 12-month delay before such articles were required to be made publicly available, in 2024, NIH revised the Public Access Policy to remove the embargo period so that researchers, students, and members of the public have rapid access to these findings.\n\nNIH is the crown jewel of the American biomedical research system. However, a recent Pew Research Center study shows that only about 25% of Americans have a “great deal of confidence” that scientists are working for the public good. Earlier implementation of the Public Access Policy will help increase public confidence in the research we fund while also ensuring that the investments made by taxpayers produce replicable, reproducible, and generalizable results that benefit all Americans.\n\nProviding speedy public access to NIH-funded results is just one of the ways we are working to earn back the trust of the American people. Trust in science is an essential element in Making America Healthy Again. As such, NIH and its research partners will continue to promote maximum transparency in all that we do.\n\nJay Bhattacharya, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nDirector, National Institutes of Health"}

And we just got some potentially good news.\n\nSwitch 2 pre-orders are already rolling along in the U.K. And we've also heard our first reported date for Canada pre-orders recently.\n\nNow, reliable leaker billbil-kun has posted potential U.S. pre-order dates. Yes, dates, as they cited \"conflicting data\" leading to April 21 or April 30 as the Switch 2 pre-order start date in the U.S.\n\n(Image credit: billbil-kun/BlueSky)\n\nIn the post, billbil-kun also said that accessories like the new Pro controller will be available for pre-order on April 30.\n\nI would think Nintendo would want to launch the console and accessories for pre-order at the same time, which leads to me to think the console will launch on April 30.\n\nWaiting on Switch 2 for US\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order date for the U.S. was initially set for April 9, but Nintendo decided to postpone it indefinitely as the company needed to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe person responsible for this leak, billbil-kun , just gave us a tentative pre-order date for Canada of April 23. So if this leaker is right, the U.S. Switch 2 pre-order date could be slightly before or after the date for Canada.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

We were quite impressed with the new console in our Switch 2 hands-on. We like the larger, higher-refresh rate display, 4K support with the doc and more comfy Joy-Cons that attach magnetically.\n\nThe Switch 2 game lineup also looks pretty strong, especially the new Mario Kart World. And Nintendo is hosting a live stream for that game tomorrow at 9 am et."}

Even if we never see them (remember Project Soli?), the ideas that come from Google's genius worker bees can be cool as heck.\n\nBut hearing them can also be a pain in the you-know-what. It's always been that way, and the reason has never changed — Google I/O is not for you and me.\n\n(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)\n\nMaybe I'm getting ahead of myself. If you're a software developer interested in Google's consumer products, or if you are interested in becoming one, then it is for you. If you're a regular Jane or Joe, like most of us, then it's a couple of days of talk about tokens and APIs with a tiny bit of interesting stuff sprinkled through.\n\nIt's my job to pay attention, and I still love to dabble with development, but even I get overwhelmed. Not that I'm some sort of tech Superman, but I am closer to the actual intended audience than most.\n\nDon't worry though, because after all these years I have figured out exactly how to digest what's cool and different coming from Google's annual developer conference: don't pay a lot of attention to it.\n\n(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)\n\nReally, I'm serious. If you're a bit of a nerd, then the keynote and What's New in Android presentations can be fun to watch, but be prepared to hear about stuff like those tokens, limits, AI engines, and analytical training for most of the hour.\n\nLet people like me, who are forced to watch and pay attention, do it. Then we tell you about it, without all the tech-nerd gobbly-goo. Anything cool will be all over your favorite tech websites; we'll be covering it extensively because it's what we at Android Central do best. We might even get a little nerdy from time to time (I forgive you if you don't read my I/O nerd articles).\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhen everything is said and done we will have a complete wrap-up of everything announced as well as the gems that get hidden in the individual sessions. So will other Android websites, or general tech sites like The Verge.\n\nRead all of those. If it sounds cool, read it twice, even. Then, be prepared to never see any of it materialize so that when some of it does happen, it's a pleasant surprise. Cynical, but healthy.\n\nLike I said earlier, Google I/O isn't for you. Really, even the stuff about what's coming in Android 16 isn't for you. On its surface, it is meant to get developers ready, but at its core, it's all done for the shareholders.\n\nLike it or not, all businesses work this way, and Google isn't an exception. Every single decision has to start with \"How does this affect share value?\" or eventually there will be no decisions to make because there will be no Google to make them.\n\nWhat Google has planned for its own Pixel phones is often cool as heck, and sometimes we even get to see some of it rub off on the software from other companies. If you really want to know about Android 16 for the Galaxy S25, for example, you should watch Samsung's developer conference.\n\nEither way, hearing about it can be fun. Learning about it without sitting through the slog and trying to pay attention is even better."}

This is basically the “heart” of Yakread, the whole reason I wanted to make the app in the first place. (And it's about 200 lines of code. Funny how much additional stuff has to be layered on top just to make those 200 lines of code usable.)\n\nThis part of the algorithm does three main things: it picks which subscription posts to recommend; it picks which bookmarked articles to recommend; and it decides in what order to mix those posts and articles together. The end result is a batch of, say, 30 items which will be displayed to the user on their For You feed.\n\n(Instead of “posts” and “articles”, I typically use the more general term “item”, which is a common term for things that recommender systems recommend.)\n\nBookmarks\n\nFirst we take all your unread bookmarked items and sort them by how many times you've scrolled past them previously. For items with the same number of “skips,” we sort by how recently the item was bookmarked. “Fresher” items (those that have been skipped less and were bookmarked more recently) come first.\n\nTo shake things up a bit, we then partially shuffle the items. I wrote a simple shuffle algorithm that has a bias toward leaving items close to their original spots. There's a “randomness” parameter (I'll call it p) you can set between 0 and 1: 0 will make the algorithm behave like a completely random shuffle, and 1 will leave the items in their original order.\n\nI've set p to 0.1. That might make it sound like the items will be mostly-but-not-completely in random order, minimizing the impact of the initial sort-by-freshness. However, the parameter affects the randomness in a non-linear way. The following graph approximately shows the probability that the first item in the shuffled list will be one of the first ten items in the original list (y axis), given different values for p (x axis):\n\n(The formula technically needs one more term that takes into account the size of the original list; however, if the original list is at least 50 ish items then that term is pretty small.)\n\nSo for p = 0.1, there's a 65% chance the first bookmark item will be one of the ten freshest items. I might tweak that parameter based on gut feel after I start using the rewritten app.\n\nThe final step for bookmark recommendations is that we look at the items’ URLs and only recommend at most one bookmark per website (host). I added this filter because about six months ago I bookmarked a few hundred articles from a particular website, and they still dominate my Yakread feed. I already had a filter like this for subscriptions (each batch of subscriptions includes at most one item per subscription).\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscription recommendations have two main steps: first we pick a list of subscriptions to recommend (and in which order); then pick one item from each subscription.\n\nI'll knock out the second step first: it's basically the same as the bookmark algorithm. We sort the items by freshness, do our randomish-shuffle thing, then pick the first item in the resulting list.\n\nTo pick the subscriptions in the first place, first we calculate an “affinity score” for each subscription that represents how much you like it. I look at the 10 most recent interactions you've had with each subscription:\n\nview: you clicked on this item for the first time.\n\nskip: you clicked on a subsequent item in the For You feed but not this one.\n\nlike / dislike: you clicked the “favorite” / “not interested” button while viewing the item.\n\nTo turn those interactions into a single score, I’ve currently assigned somewhat-arbitrary weights to each interaction (e.g. +2 for a view and -1 for a skip) and then I take the “beta distribution expected value,” which means: if you’re flipping a coin and +2 represents getting heads twice while -1 represents getting tails once, what is the probability of getting a heads next? Also, to help new subscriptions get more exposure, I give them a starting score of +3.\n\nThis approach is simple and seems to work well enough (when I use the score to query for my own top/bottom 10 subscriptions, the results seem reasonable). It would be nice to remove the need for me to pick weights though. At some point I might try using some kind of machine learning model that can take a list of interactions and predict the probabilities of what the next interaction will be (apparently an RNN would work). Then the score can be the probability that the next action is positive (i.e. a view or a like).\n\nAfter sorting the subscriptions by their affinity score, we give some extra priority to subscriptions that the user has manually pinned. We split the subscriptions into two lists, pinned and unpinned. Then we interleave those those lists back into a single list by repeatedly picking from which of the two lists to take the next interleaved subscription.\n\nMost of the time we simply pick whichever subscription (pinned or unpinned) has the highest affinity score. But 30% of the time, we pick the next pinned subscription regardless of affinity.\n\nAfter doing all that, we do our random-ish shuffle thing on the subscriptions list, then we move on to the step described above where we pick an item from each subscription.\n\nInterleaving subscriptions and bookmarks\n\nAt this point we have a list of subscription items and a list of bookmarked items, and we need to interleave them into a final list which will be shown to the user. An easy and not terrible approach would be to flip a coin for each item in the final list: heads and it comes from subscriptions, tails and it comes from bookmarks. And at a base level, that is what I’m doing.\n\nHowever, that could have issues if the user has more subscription items than bookmarks or vice versa. If you’ve already scrolled past all your unread bookmarked items several times but you have a bunch of new subscription items, we should probably lean towards recommending the subscription items.\n\nI do this by comparing the two lists pairwise and selecting an item via weighted random choice based on how many times they’ve been previously skipped (i.e. scrolled past in the For You feed). e.g. if the first bookmark item has been skipped twice and the first subscription item has been skipped once, then there’ll be a 60% chance we select the subscription item and a 40% chance we select the bookmark item."}

He provided one method for doing this but omitted discussing an older, simpler method that almost accomplishes the same thing.\n\nHow To Find Articles By Older Published Date\n\nThe person asking the question understood how to find articles published from the previous year, month, and twenty four hours. But didn’t know how to find articles published before a specific date.\n\nThe post on Bluesky asked:\n\n“Is there a way to search for articles OLDER than a certain date? I know advanced search can guarantee in the past year, month, 24h, but I want to specifically be able to find articles published BEFORE X historical event happened, and I can’t find a way to filter. Help?”\n\nSearch Liaison posted this way to do it which can be difficult to memorize if you’re a busy person:\n\n“We have before: and after: operators that are still in beta.

I survey a handful of books and articles in a particular year from math, economics, philosophy, international relations, and other interesting topics. This project was inspired by my retrospective on Foreign Affairs' first issue from September 1922.\n\nA persistent theme throughout the 1820s is the tension between Enlightenment ideals and conservative reaction. The books and articles discussed below capture various facets of this conflict. William Hazlitt’s collection of essays examines intellectuals from the turn of the century, many of whom became swept up in the Romantic movement and adopted illiberal views. J. C. L. de Sismondi’s survey characterizes international relations in the first quarter of the nineteenth century as a struggle between the forces of liberty and tyranny and is optimistic for the former. Liberal ideas were advancing steadily in education, as seen in Henry Brougham’s pamphlet on Mechanics’ Institutes and adult education and the plans to found additional universities in England outside of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nOf the bunch below, I most enjoyed Samuel Bailey’s On the Nature, Measures, and Causes of Value and The Philosopher in the Kitchen by Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin. The former proffers a subjective theory of value that is far ahead of its time both in content and style, and the latter is a time-capsule of French culture through a treatise on gastronomy.\n\nThere are several books I didn’t get to but are otherwise interesting and important. Appeal of One Half of the Human Race by William Thompson critiques the position of women in society and takes issue with fellow liberal James Mill’s claim in his Essay on Government that women need not be extended political rights. I discuss the preface below. Thomas Hodgskin’s pamphlet Labour Defended Against the Claims of Capital argues that labor is the source of all value and is, thereby, undercompensated. John Ramsay McCulloch’s Principles of Political Economy became the standard textbook in political economy until John Stuart Mill’s Principles from 1848.

This book is an extended critique of the labor theories of value developed by David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus and expounded on by Thomas de Quincey.\n\nRather than an abstract property, Bailey argues that value is a relation between two commodities at a given time defined by their ratio of exchange. The relative value I assign to two goods depends on psychological considerations and may be different than the value that you assign. Moreover, the relative value may vary over time. This view requires comparatively little metaphysical baggage.\n\nPortrait of Samuel Bailey\n\n(probably)\n\nPerhaps, instead, the amount of labor required is a good measure of value. Bailey contends that it’s unclear what’s even meant by a measure of value. A charitable view is that some common commodity such as money is a good measure of value, since we can use it as a medium to compare how much one is willing to exchange for a given commodity. This, however, falls short of the objective measure that classical economists desired, since money too can rise in value with respect to other commodities.\n\nAnother possibility is that the amount of labor required to produce a commodity is the cause of the value of the commodity. Surely, it’s a cause; however, there’s no reason to think its the cause. Even abstracting away from market conditions, the amount of capital employed in the production of a good ought to be considered as a factor. Importantly, it’s likely not the case that capital is just accumulated labor.\n\nThis book is very readable and provides a convincing critique of Ricardo’s labor theory of value. Bailey mentions Robert Torrens’ An Essay on the Production of Wealth (1821) as another recent contribution to political economy that avoids the labor theory pitfalls. In addition, Bailey’s work provides the most complete and modern citations of the time, which eases the burden of navigating the literature.\n\nRavenstone’s Funding System\n\nPublication: The Quarterly Review\n\nLink: Google Books\n\nThis is an unsigned review of the pseudonymous Piercy Ravenstone’s Thoughts on the Funding System and Its Effects (1824). This book critiques England’s method of funding its wars in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries through bond issuance, which Ravenstone alleges is both wasteful and to the benefit of the wealthy at the expense of the masses. The reviewer contends that issuing bonds by the state is more reasonable and cost effective than alternatives.\n\nAssuming the state needs to raise money for a worthy cause such as defending its territory from an invading state, how might this be achieved? If the state doesn’t borrow directly through bonds or similar instruments, it can levy a tax on the public. While this seems like a more reasonable approach, since estates can be taxed proportional to their wealth, several wrinkles emerge. What do we do about estates that are wealthy but illiquid? Have them borrow against their assets? There are efficiencies of scale to be gained by negotiating this as a single borrower as the state would. Funding a war effort diverts capital from other investments; however, removing capital uniformly will have a worse effect on returns than only employing idle capital or capital that was less productively employed.\n\nThe reviewer throws around a lot of numbers, and it isn’t always clear where their calculations come from.\n\nM’Culloch’s Discourse on Political Economy\n\nPublication: The Westminster Review\n\nLink: Google Books\n\nThis is a short and favorable review of John Ramsay McCulloch’s A Discourse on the Rise, Progress, Peculiar Objects and Importance of Political Economy (1824), which borders on advertisement. The reviewers regard this book as an important part of the coming-of-age of political economy, where the field became known and respected outside of a handful of thinkers. The reviewers pinpoint the year of ascendency to 1818, which is nearly fifty years after the publication of The Wealth of Nations (1776) and sandwiched between David Ricardo’s On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817) and Ricardo joining the House of Commons in 1819.\n\nThis is an unsigned review attributed to William Ellis and John Stuart Mill by Gonçalo L. Fonseca, the author and maintainer of the HETWebsite.\n\nPractical Observations upon the Education of the People, Addressed to the Working Classes and their Employers\n\nAuthor: Henry Brougham\n\nLink: Internet Archive\n\nMechanics’ Institutes were established in the early nineteenth century to provide education and training for the working-class, particularly those in the manufacturing. The idea was to communicate the fundamentals of the natural sciences that underlie the processes in which the workers operate. These institutes more generally sought to rectify a glaring deficiency in adult education in Britain.\n\nThe Manchester Mechanics' Institute ca. 1825\n\nHenry Brougham was a Whig MP and a vocal advocate for popular education and other liberal causes such as expanding the voting franchise and slavery abolition. In this essay, he argues that providing time and a venue for workers to learn new skills and ideas would benefit the workers, the factories, and the community. On Brougham’s vision, these institutes would be joint ventures, where wealthy benefactors provide the funds for starting up, the factories guarantee the workers have sufficient time and place to meet, and the workers themselves participate and, eventually, govern the institute.\n\nWhile there was some variation, the general blueprint is for an institute to house a library, hold reading groups, and offer full course lectures. Importantly, though, the institutes sought to fend off partisan dispute by discouraging or even banning books and lectures on theological or political matters. By the time of writing, several Institutes had been founded from London to the industrial north and Scotland. Many of these institutions exist today through lineal descent and form a large part of the higher education in the UK.\n\nPhilosophy\n\nThe Philosopher in the Kitchen\n\nAuthor: Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin\n\nTranslated by Anne Drayton (1970)\n\nFrench Title: Physiologie du goût\n\nLink: Internet Archive\n\nJean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin was a French lawyer, politician, and noted gastronome. His part-memoir part-treatise, Physiologie du goût, is a prolegomena of sorts to the science of gourmandism. One may be tempted to think that this study of food and culture is merely a guide to gluttony. Brillat-Savarin is careful to dispel such notions. The glutton mindlessly consumes to excess, while the gourmand appreciates and enjoys to satisfaction. Far from a handbook to hedonism, this analysis of the art of the gourmand encompasses gastronomy, physical and mental health, and social interaction.\n\nThe book is written in short sections loosely divided into themes, mixing technical discussions of the author’s theory of food chemistry with recipes and tales from his eventful life. The writing is often witty and the translation by Anne Drayton is a pleasure to read. I was hooked from the beginning by the list of aphorisms that preface the main text; the best of which reads:\n\nDessert without cheese is like a pretty woman with only one eye.\n\nIn the section on physical and mental health, Brillat-Savarin discusses the importance of diet in maintaining health and longevity. He makes a case for the benefits of a low-carb diet for losing excess weight, becoming one of its first proponents.\n\nThere’s an amusing mention of a correlational health outcomes study by Louis-René Villermé from the prior year. This study finds that “good cheer is far from being harmful to health, and that, all things being equal, gourmands live longer than other men.” Elaborating on the methods:\n\nHe compared the various classes of society in which good cheer is habitual with those which are poorly fed, covering the entire social scale. He also considered the various quarters of Paris with one another according to their wealth, for it is well known that wide divergencies exist in this respect.\n\nThe most interesting section, however, is the discussion of restaurants near the book’s conclusion. Restaurants in the modern sense were a relatively recent innovation, appearing in Paris in the latter half of the eighteenth century and quickly spreading throughout Europe and beyond during the French Empire’s warring efforts.\n\nThe Spirit of the Age: Or, Contemporary Portraits\n\nAuthor: William Hazlitt\n\nLink: WikiSource\n\nThe conservative reaction to the French Revolution dampened liberal attitudes around the turn of the nineteenth century. This collection of essays captures this milieu through portraits of several prominent British figures, from philosophers to poets to MPs.\n\nSelf-portrait circa 1802\n\nOutside of a few characters depicted as the embodiment of tyranny and injustice such the Tory MP Lord Eldon, Hazlitt’s general assessment is that each figure’s early work is superior to their later work due to their abandonment of liberal principles. Hazlitt is particularly critical in this regard to the Lake Poets.\n\nIn short bursts, Hazlitt’s style is engaging. The opening salvo sharply critiques Jeremy Bentham’s philosophical project as fantasy and navel-gazing. The discussion of Coleridge’s intellectual adventures demonstrates the breadth of Hazlitt’s interests. The profiles of various MPs give insight into the position of the intellectual in the political realm.\n\nWhen read together, however, this collection grates on one’s mind. Hazlitt has a tendency to juxtapose figures and ideas as diametric opposites. For example, the article on long-time Edinburgh Review editor Francis Jeffrey contrasts the Whig-friendly Edinburgh Review with the Tory Quarterly Review. All that is right with the world is attributed to the Edinburgh and all the muck given to the Quarterly. To be fair, the Edinburgh Review is the better magazine in my estimation; yet, both are inferior to the Westminster.\n\nHazlitt by William Bewick (1825)\n\nHazlitt can stretch his credibility to the point of becoming an unreliable narrator. The article on Walter Scott criticizes his conservative overtones through romanticizing the past; yet, when comparing Scott with Lord Byron, Hazlitt holds the former to be the greatest moralist of the age and the latter a phony liberal.\n\nI most enjoyed the essays on Walter Scott, William Godwin, Horne Tooke, and James MacKintosh. I knew of Scott as the author of Waverley, the philosopher Godwin only as father to Mary Shelley, but was unaware of the interesting MPs: the jurist Tooke and the Scottish philosopher MacKintosh.\n\nPhilosophical Considerations on the Sciences and Savants\n\nAuthor: Auguste Comte\n\nTranslated by Henry Dix Hutton (1877)\n\nFrench Title: Considérations philosophiques sur la science et les savants\n\nPublication: Le Producteur\n\nLink: Internet Archive\n\nAuguste Comte is a often presented as one of the villains in the history of social thought. Similar to Wittgenstein, there is the early Comte and the later Comte. The early Comte is interested in the history of thought and intellectual development and is often associated with the six volume Course of Positive Philosophy (1830-1842). It’s the later Comte associated with the System of Positive Polity (1851-1854) and his religion of humanity that is much reviled.\n\nIn this article, Comte introduces his law of three stages and the hierarchy of the sciences. The former holds that human intellectual development passes through three stages: theological, metaphysical, and positive. Theological thought is all encompassing and often anthropomorphized, attributing phenomena to supernatural beings. This mode of thought is rigid and allows little room for change. Metaphysical thought is still spooky but less centralized, allowing for the possibility of change. Positive thought is empirical, scientific, and decentralized and seeks to explain phenomena through general laws.\n\nComte argues that the sciences can be categorized into a hierarchy beginning with the natural sciences up through the social sciences, similar to other attempts to explain the unity of science. Fields of study in the hierarchy progress from bottom up with some fields being scientific while others are still spooky at a given time. In the early nineteenth century, physics and astronomy attained the status of a positive science, while the moral sciences were still largely theological and metaphysical, being dominated by Medieval theology and eighteenth century Enlightenment thought.\n\nThis leads to an interesting critique of encyclopedias and the organization of knowledge. Comte argues that such projects are only feasible once human thought has sufficiently developed; otherwise, two adjacent fields at different stages of development may offer mutually exclusive explanations for the same phenomena.\n\nThe article concludes with sketching a history of intellectual development. Early societies were theocracies, typified by Egypt, where there was no distinction between priest, philosopher, and state authority. Ancient Greece represented the transition to metaphysics with the distinction of the philosopher from the priest. This is illustrated by the differing philosophical attitudes of Plato and Aristotle. An antagonism between science and theology developed as they butted heads on social issues. Several attempts to reconcile the two under the auspices of theology e.g. by the Jesuits were at best temporarily successful. What remains is to create a social physics i.e. a positive social science. This, in turn, would lead to a reorganization of society in the hands of technocrats.\n\nMathematics\n\nOn the method of the least squares\n\nAuthor: James Ivory\n\nPublication: Philosophical Magazine\n\nLink: T&F Online\n\nLeast squares is an estimation method that fits a line to a set of points that minimizes the sum of the squared distances from the points to the line and is a workhorse in statistics and machine learning. This method was introduced by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805 as a heuristic to correct for measurement error in astronomical data. Aside from an independent investigation from Robert Adrain in 1808, Carl Gauss and Pierre-Simon Laplace offered the first justifications for least squares in important publications from 1809 and 1810, where Gauss derived the normal distribution and Laplace proved the central limit theorem.\n\nIvory’s paper offers a few justifications for least squares and frames the problem in terms of reducing error from astronomical observations. Ivory begins by critiquing an approach from the early eighteenth century by Roger Cotes that correctly observed that averaging multiple noisy observations decreases error. The first two justifications are the most clearly developed. The first employs an analogy with levers and fulcrums to represent how each observation is weighted. The second is more reasonable and argues that least squares is principled and minimizes mean squared error.\n\nIvory received the Copley Medal\n\nfrom the Royal Society in 1814\n\nIvory is an interesting and tragic historical character. He was a Scottish mathematician of the first order and a chief exponent of the continental approach to analysis and mechanics and one of the first in Britain to use Leibniz’s notation for the differential and integral calculus. Despite receiving several awards from the Royal Society and even being knighted, Ivory was plagued by delusion and paranoia, which limited his contributions and resulted in controversies with other big names of the time.\n\nOn the Nature of the Function Expressive of the Law of Human Mortality, and on a New Mode of Determining the Value of Life Contingencies\n\nAuthor: Benjamin Gompertz\n\nPublication: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London\n\nLink: JSTOR\n\nImagine you’re trying to determine whether or not a life insurance policy or an annuity is priced fairly. How might you go about this? A reasonable place to start is collecting data on how long people live and calculating a contingency table or an empirical distribution. Even if this sample is representative, this approach has several drawbacks, e.g., the estimated distribution is discrete and making the distribution more fine-grained comes at the cost of higher variance estimates. Calculating the present value of an instrument from a discrete distribution can be computationally expensive (especially using methods from the early nineteenth century).\n\nAn interpolated empirical distribution of\n\nmortality rates (log scale) in the US in 2003.\n\nGompertz proposes a model for the mortality rate at age $x$ ($\\mu_x$) that increases exponentially with age, now called the Gompertz Law of Mortality. In symbols, $\\mu_x = Bc^x$, where $x$ is age, $B$ is the baseline mortality rate, and $c > 1$ is the acceleration of mortality. Much of the paper shows that the proposed model closely approximates various datasets for adulthood, except at very old age. This model provides several benefits. Being a continuous time model, calculating probabilities is as simple as integrating the mortality rate over the desired age range. Moreover, the estimation problem is reduced to two parameters $B$ and $c$ rather than the full empirical distribution.\n\nWhile some may view life insurance as a bit of a morbid topic, Gompertz doubles down on the macabre by describing his model of the mortality rate as “a deterioration, or an increased inability to withstand destruction”.\n\nInternational Relations\n\nA Review of the Efforts and Progress of Nations during the Last Twenty-Five Years\n\nAuthor: J. C. L. de Sismondi\n\nPublication: Revue Encyclopédique\n\nTranslated by Peter Stephen Du Ponceau in The Port Folio (1825)\n\nLink: HathiTrust\n\nThe period from the late eighteenth to the early nineteenth century was the age of revolutions. From Europe to the Americas and Africa, monarchies became less absolute - in some cases even overthrown - and power and wealth became more dispersed.\n\nAn ink portrait of Sismondi\n\nfrom the Online Library of Liberty\n\nIn this review, Sismondi surveys revolutions the world over. He characterizes this period as a conflict between two opposing forces: one pushing in the direction of Enlightenment ideas and greater individual liberty, and the other toward greater concentration of power. The former is the wave emanating from the overthrow of the ancien régime in France, and the latter is the conservative reaction.\n\nIndividual political movements run the gamut between these extremes; however, Sismondi identifies some patterns to help make sense of the aftermath. When revolutions come from within and capture the elusive public opinion, they tend to favor greater liberty and enfranchisement. In contrast, revolutions brought about by external actors tend to concentrate power, often in the hands of those same actors. Overall, however, the world is trending toward greater liberty and prosperity.\n\nA review in the North American Review takes issue with some of Sismondi’s claims. Sismondi overplays the success of Enlightenment ideas in France; however, this is understandable, since Sismondi had to get his publication approved by the French censors. On the other hand, Sismondi underplays the success of such adoption elsewhere in Western Europe such as Germany and Italy. Perhaps, this was motivated by national rivalry. While I read Sismondi as relatively optimistic about Enlightenment ideals prevailing, the reviewer is even more so.\n\nLetter to Mrs. Wheeler\n\nAuthor: William Thompson\n\nLink: Google Books\n\nThis letter to the political writer Anna Doyle Wheeler acts as the preface to Thompson’s Appeal of One Half of the Human Race. Thompson begins the letter by attributing the ideas proffered in the book as the joint product of himself and Wheeler. The core argument is that the position of women in society and the laws restricting their political rights are not only unjust but are suboptimal from an utilitarian perspective. By denying women education, political participation, and economic independence, society is squandering a vast reservoir of talent and potential.\n\nAnna Wheeler c.1825\n\nThis book is directly responding to a passage discussing representative democracy in James Mill’s Essay on Government for the Supplement to the Encyclopedia Britannica. Mill argues that, since subgroups of the population can represent the broader interest of the people, we should not extend political rights to women. This is a bit baffling to read, since Mill is a radical arguing for liberal reforms, and certainly rubs me the wrong way. I’m glad a response on this point exists! While I found it dragged on too long, this opening letter is a strong hook for the remainder of the book.\n\nMisc\n\nNew University in London\n\nPublication: Edinburgh Review\n\nLink: Google Books\n\nSince the eleventh century, Oxford and Cambridge were the only universities in England. With rise of the working class during the first industrial revolution, the early nineteenth century saw the founding of Mechanics’ Institutes and mutual improvement societies. In the 1820s and 1830s, several candidates popped up for a third university in England to meet the demand for education. This unsigned article discusses and advertises the founding of London University, now called University College London.\n\n\"The London University\" by\n\nThomas H. Shepherd (1828)\n\nWhile the two university system may have made sense during the Middle Ages, the author argues that it is no longer the case. As the demand for education increased, Oxford and Cambridge were scarcely able to take on more students. The cost of attendance for room and board, tutors, and religious services were exorbitant and priced out many would-be students, an evergreen complaint. Without competition within England, educational standards had stagnated and not kept up with recent advances in knowledge. Moreover, the author cautions that sending young men far from home during their formative years is a recipe for debauchery.\n\nLondon seems to be a natural fit for a university. Not only is it home to the Royal Society with its large pool of potential professors, but it has ample hospitals to justify a medical school. The author closes by advising that the proposed university was still raising funds. London University would open the next year in 1826."}

Those taken into custody in a string of high-profile student detentions captured on video have not faced any criminal charges and instead appear to have been targeted for involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. The Trump administration has said repeatedly that visas are a \"privilege\" and can be revoked at any time for a wide variety of reasons. But the crackdown appears to be far wider than initially thought, with more than 1,000 international students or recent graduates at colleges across the US now having had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed, according to a tracker from Inside Higher Ed, an online news site covering the sector. For many, the precise reasons are unknown, and universities have often only learned of the changes when checking a government-run database that logs the visa status of international students. The combination of targeted detentions and reports of wide-scale visa revocations have left campuses on edge, from the biggest public universities to elite Ivy League institutions, students and faculty told the BBC. \"I could be next,\" said one student visa-holder attending Georgetown University, who has written articles about Israel and the war in Gaza. He's begun carrying around a card in his pocket that lists his constitutional rights, in case he is ever stopped by law enforcement. Another student in Texas said he's afraid to leave his apartment, even to buy groceries. And at some colleges, departments are being hit as researchers abroad refuse to return to the US. Most students the BBC spoke to requested anonymity out of fear that having their names in the media could make them a target. The BBC has contacted the Department of Education for comment.\n\nA flyer on a bathroom stall at Georgetown University in Washington DC\n\nWatch: Moment Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi arrested by ICE\n\nHis detention followed that of Columbia University student protest organiser Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident arrested at home in New York but now awaiting deportation from a facility in Louisiana. Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who co-authored a student newspaper op-ed about Gaza and was detained in Massachusetts, is also being held in Louisiana. Last Monday, Mohsen Mahdawi, another Columbia student protester, was detained in Vermont as he attended an interview to obtain US citizenship. Like Mr Khalil, he holds a green card, rather than a student visa. \"Based on the detentions that we're seeing, I think there is a possibility anyone who has been outspoken about Palestine can be detained,\" said the Georgetown student, who knew Mr Suri. The White House says it is going after those who have been involved in activities that \"run counter\" to US national interests. In Mr Khalil's case, officials have cited a 1952 law that empowers the government to order someone deported if their presence in the country could pose unfavourable consequences for US foreign policy. In a post on X, the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association celebrated Mr Khalil's arrest, calling him the \"ringleader of chaos\" at the university.\n\nRubio on student activists: US pulled visas from 300 \"lunatics\"\n\nPolling suggests that immigration is an issue where President Trump enjoys some of his highest approval ratings, with recent Reuters and AP-NORC surveys suggesting about half of US adults approve of action in that area, several points higher than his overall rating. Universities are also being targeted at an institutional level. This week, the White House's task force on combating antisemitism froze over $2bn in funding for Harvard University, after the university refused to agree to a list of demands that it said would amount to \"surrendering its independence\". Harvard just stood up to Trump. How long can it last?\n\nTrump administration threatens Harvard with foreign student ban Trump officials have said that if Harvard doesn't comply with a request for information on certain student visaholders, it will stop granting visas to international students who want to study there. Georgetown professor Nader Hashemi said he believes the government's main goal is \"silencing dissent\" by intimidating would-be protesters. The Georgetown student says he has asked his parents not to fly from India to the US to see him graduate with a master's degree in just a few weeks. He is still unsure if he will even attend the ceremony.\n\nAn Imam at the Georgetown mosque leads prayers for Palestinians in Gaza\n\nIn addition to checking his email daily to see if he is among the hundreds that have had their visas revoked recently, he has also prepared for the possibility of sudden arrest. \"I have cleared my chats across messaging apps, and I have learned how to quickly lock my phone in SOS mode,\" he said. Georgetown professors have even begun offering spare rooms to students who worry about being visited by immigration agents at their residences, said Prof Hashemi. \"This is part of the trauma that I think students are facing,\" he said. At Tufts University, outside of Boston, Massachusetts, students are waiting to see what happens to Ms Ozturk, who was detained outside her home.\n\nWatch: Moment Tufts University student is arrested by masked immigration agents"}

As such it does not impose strict word count limits, but the EO has established certain general guidelines that provide a framework to follow for several types of articles.\n\nGeneral article format\n\nPlease write articles in MS Word and save as a .doc file.\n\nThe article should begin with an introduction that provides the essentials – who, what, where, when, and why – to provide the reader with an overview of the topic to be discussed. For articles about meetings include the number of people who attended (e.g., in-person and virtual) and the objective of the meeting.\n\nThe introduction paragraph is followed by a transition paragraph that takes the reader into the main content of the article. The article should wrap up with a conclusion.\n\nThe suggested page length for each type of article includes inserted visual elements. In addition to the Word file, please also send separate higher resolution files for graphics, photos, animations, or visualizations. More specific requirements are available in the Guidelines for Graphics, Photos, Visualizations, Animations.\n\nAnnouncement article\n\nAnnouncement articles promote a variety of topics. Historically this type of article includes releases of new or updated Earth Science data products, information on new tools for processing and viewing data, previews of outreach activities for the Science Support Office (e.g., AGU, Earth Day), and details on upcoming science meetings or workshops (i.e., beyond the information conveyed on the NASA science calendar).\n\nThe article is structured like a Feature article, but it is shorter, no more than two pages, including graphics and captions – see Guidelines for Graphics, Photos, Visualizations, Animations.\n\nFor Example: NASA Invites You to Create Landsat-Inspired Arts and Crafts, The Earth Observer, Mar–Apr 2021, 33:4, 13–14. Other examples are available on the archived issues of The Earth Observer.\n\nIf you have an idea for an Announcement article, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\n\nFeature article\n\nFeature articles cover a wide range of Earth science topics, including satellite mission launches and historic milestones, field campaign updates, data processing tool tutorials, and summaries of NASA Science Support Office outreach events. Typically, these articles span ~8–14 pages (3000–4000 words). There are cases where longer or shorter articles are acceptable.\n\nA photo essay format for some topics, such as outreach event summaries, offer an option to convey a significant portion of the information using a collection of photos and descriptive captions.\n\nFor Example: Looking Back on Looking Up: The 2024 Total Solar Eclipse\n\nIf you have an idea for an Feature article, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\n\nHybrid article\n\nHybrid articles combine elements of a Feature and a Summary article. Often, these articles start with a few pages of descriptive text about the subject, followed by a summary of a particular meeting. Owing to their hybrid nature, these articles tend to run a bit longer than the standard Summary article. These articles typically range between 8–12 pages (3000–5000 words.)\n\nIf you have an idea for a Hybrid article, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\n\nIn Memoriam article\n\nIn Memoriam articles recognize individuals who have played prominent roles in NASA Earth Science. These articles tend to include biographical information about the deceased individual, a brief mention of their education, and a summary of their major career achievements – with emphasis on achievements related to NASA. A typical In Memoriam article layout includes one or more photos, including one of the person being memorialized.\n\nFor Example: In Memoriam: Mary Cleave [1947–2023] The In Memoriam link provides recent examples of In Memoriam articles published in The Earth Observer. Other articles are available by searching the publication’s archived issues.\n\nThis type of article is structured like a Feature article with the exception that the subject is referred to by their first name. In Memoriam drafts should be no more than two pages in Word – including graphics and captions – see Guidelines for Graphics, Photos, Visualizations, Animations.\n\nIf you know someone to eulogize in The Earth Observer for their contributions to NASA Earth Science, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\n\nKudos article\n\nKudos articles acknowledges individuals or groups either within or connected to (funded by) NASA who receive significant NASA-wide awards.\n\nA Kudo article follows a structure similar to a Feature article. It should be a maximum of one page in Word – including a photo of person(s) or group being honored – see Guidelines for Graphics, Photos, Visualizations, Animations.\n\nFor Example: MOPITT Canadian Principal Investigator Receives Two Awards, The Earth Observer, Mar–Apr 2021, 33:2, 28 [bottom]. Other examples are available by searching through archived issues of The Earth Observer.\n\nIf you know an individual or a group of people worthy of recognition for their NASA-related achievement, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft submission. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\n\nSummary article\n\nSummary articles provide an overview of recent scientific meetings and/or workshops. Ideally, a Summary article should be no more than 6 pages (~2500 words).\n\nProvide the flavor of the event rather than describe it in detail. Summarize the overall nature and sense of sessions. The Editorial Team has found that a mix of narrative descriptions of key (usually programmatic) presentations (e.g., plenary sessions) and summaries with less detail for the remaining (e.g., technical) presentations is optimum.\n\nNow that The Earth Observer is published online, it is the view of the Editorial Team format summary articles using a “minutes-style” report of the meeting. While space no longer precludes publishing such an article as it did in the past, the format does not translate well to the online communication medium. Unless a reader is really interested in the specific topic(s) discussed in the article, it is likely that they will not scroll through to the end – no matter how nice the layout looks.\n\nIf you have an idea for a Summary article, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\n\nGuidelines for Preparing Articles for The Earth Observer\n\nEOis a hybrid publication, landing somewhere between a science journal and popular science magazine. Therefore, the focus should be on phenomena rather than data. The article provides an opportunity to publicize your mission, research to ~1653 subscribers (as of August 2024) around the world. Please review the content in this guideline before writing your article and reach out to the Editorial Team if you have any questions.\n\nWriting for the web\n\nThe EO audience ranges from scientists to the general public. When writing an article, use plain language and active voice. When in doubt, write the article so that it would be understandable to a friend or relative not in the field.\n\nFor Example:\n\nPassive voice: The rate of evaporation is controlled by the size of an opening.\n\nActive voice: The size of an opening controls the rate of evaporation.\n\nAvoid using jargon and technical language. When it is necessary to use technical language, please use ITALICS to offset the word in the text. Follow the italicized word with a brief definition or explanation.\n\nFor Example: Inference – formally derived uncertainty for area estimates of biomass, height, or other metrics – can take different forms, each of which includes specific assumptions. In this breakout session, participants considered the strengths and limitations of different inference types (e.g., intensity of computation or the ability to use different models).\n\nWriting content for a website differs from print. The human eye is more inclined to read shorter paragraphs separated by breaks. It is ideal to keep sentences and paragraphs short.\n\nUse one space after a period. The two spaces after a period is an artifact of conventional type writers.\n\nAvoid editorializing in the article. For example, do not characterize a spacewalk as “daring” or “dangerous.” Describe the events factually. If things are described well, readers easily can decide for themselves whether they are daring or dangerous. Never, under any circumstances, insert any personal, political, ideological, or religious opinions or beliefs into NASA news media products.\n\nCatchy headline\n\nWrite a headline that is short, searchable, and shareable. Try to keep the headline to 60 characters (including spaces). Longer headlines may be invisible to search engines.\n\nUnlike journal articles, The Earth Observer only includes individuals who made a significant contributions to the EO article. A typical article should only lists one or two authors. In some occasions, an article may have up to four authors. The authors should be formatted as follows:\n\nFirst Last, Organization, author email\n\nIf there are more you wish to give credit, consider doing so in an Acknowledgment section, as discussed in the next paragraph.\n\nNaming files\n\nFor consistency moving documents through the editorial process, please name the file by the file type, the topic, and the author’s last name.\n\nFor Example: announcement_topic_author\n\nfeature_topic_author\n\nhybrid_topic_author\n\nmemoriam_topic_author\n\nkudos_topic_author\n\nsummary_topic_author\n\nUse visuals to draw the reader in\n\nThe Earth Observer is now published online. Visual elements are critical to all EO stories and are a required element to submissions. The Editorial Team would prefer having too many graphics (i.e., photos, figures, animations, and visualizations) than too few. It is helpful to insert this content into the Word file as well as include the graphics as separate files at the time of the initial submission of the draft for editorial review. See the Guidelines for Graphics, Photos, Visualizations, Animations section for more information.\n\nSearch engine optimization\n\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) is a broad set of techniques to capitalize how search engines, such as Google, scrub content on the internet. By optimizing how articles are written, it is possible to influence where content shows up in an organic, online search. The different approaches can fill an entire book. This style guide provides a few pointers to help tweak articles to optimize how the content appears in online searches.\n\nHeadline and subheads\n\nA headline should be clear and compelling to reveal what the content is about as well as entice the searcher to click for more. A SEO headline is a ranking factor in search engine results. A headline can be crafted to rank higher in search results, which increases an article’s visibility and generate more clicks. This can be done by using SEO search terms — those terms that a person would type into a search box — in the headline. Shorter headlines (i.e., 60 characters including spaces) are often more effective during searches.\n\nSubheads provide a way to organize an article and separates the content into digestible sections. Like headlines, subheads can be optimized for SEO searches. Subheads may include key takeaways from the specific section. Keep subheads clear and concise.\n\nEarth Observer articles are now being posted online. Footnotes are no longer a functional option, which is a significant change for authors who have published articles in our print issues in the past. It is helpful to hyperlink words or short phrases in the article that directs the reader to additional content from the meeting, such as presentations, poster sessions, talks by attendees, programs/satellites, journal articles, etc. Relevant links should also be added to captions. See the Hyperlinks section for guidance on how to insert and format a hyperlink in the article.\n\nInternal links tie content in the article to other pages within an organization, such as NASA, to boost site authority. External links direct a reader to sites outside the organization. This approach also drives up site authority in SEO searches. By connecting relevant pages, it will improve article navigation and ensure users can locate relevant information.\n\nAlternate text for graphics\n\nAlternate text, or alt text, is the small description added to visual elements on the back end of a website. Search engines use the alt text to identify relevant content. Alt text also improves accessibility for all users. Tools that read webpages aloud can read alt text to help explain what visual elements contain for the visually impaired.\n\nAlt text should be concise, accurate, and use keywords. Keywords are highly relevant words or phrases associated with the picture and the content of the article.\n\nFor Example: Figure 1. Forty SWOT Early Adopter (EA) teams span the globe with a wide range of operational and applied science project topics.\n\nFigure credit: NASA\n\nKey word tag: A global map showing the locations of early adopter organizations.\n\nSubmitting An Outline\n\nAn outline is not requiredprior to submitting the first draft of an article, but an outline may be beneficial for lengthy articles (i.e., features, hybrids). Outlines are particularly helpful for first-time authors or when an author is seeking guidance about the appropriateness of content for The Earth Observer. It is hard for the team to comment without seeing something in writing. More generally, submitting an outline presents an opportunity for the editorial team to provide input on the article during the writing process – as opposed to waiting until the first draft is submitted.\n\nSubmitting Your Draft\n\nDo not submit a draft for review unless it is complete (i.e., contains all visual elements, captions, credits, and content). Unless you clearly indicate otherwise, the Editorial Team will assume your submission is ready for them to review. Version control problems result when text is updated after reviews have started.\n\nThe initial draft submitted for editorial review should include graphics. including captions and credits. The editorial process is delayed when graphics, credits, and captions are added iteratively once the process has begun.\n\nSpecific Style Guidelines\n\nOver more than 35 years as a NASA publication, The Earth Observer has developed its own unique style. Please review these specific guidelines detailed below, and let the Editorial Team know if you have any questions. In addition, The Earth Observer also adheres to the NASA Stylebook and Communications Manual, 9th edition (June 2020), which is closely aligned with the AP Stylebook.\n\nAcronyms\n\nScience is rife with acronyms. On first usage, always spell out the acronym and follow with the acronym in parenthesis. From that point on in the article, use the acronym. To ensure photos, figures, visualizations, and animations are understandable if removed from the larger text, please spell out acronyms in captions.\n\nWell-known acronyms (e.g., NASA, U.S., etc.) do not need to be spelled out. Separate the acronym for United States (e.g., U.S.) and United Kingdom (e.g., U.K.) with periods.\n\nFor Example: Level-1 (L1), Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), International Space Station (ISS), Precision Orbit Determination (POD), etc.\n\nOnly capitalize proper nouns as defined by the dictionary or AP style. The Earth Observer style does capitalize the first letter of a specific product that will be turned into an acronym.\n\nFor Example: Do not capitalize the first letter of each word in “solid rocket booster (SBR),” even though the subsequent use of the acronym SRB will appear in the article.\n\nA compound acronym arises when parentheses occur inside of parentheses. In this situation, use [BRACKETS] for the outer set of parentheses and (PARENTHESES) for those inside.\n\nFor Example: Thomas Neumann [GSFC—Deputy Director of GSFC’s Earth Sciences Division (ESD)] welcomed meeting participants on behalf of the ESD.\n\nAffiliations\n\nUse a possessive for an organization when it is part of NASA. Do not use a possessive when using the agency as an adjective.\n\nFor Example: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC); subsequent references would just use “GSFC.”\n\nFor Example: SWOT data products available through PO.DAAC provides centralized, searchable access that is available using an in-cloud commercial web service through the NASA EarthData portal.\n\nWrite out an organization that is not part of NASA.\n\nFor Example: Gustavo Oliveira [Clark University] presented details on the project \"Irrigation as Climate-Change Adaptation in the Cerrado Biome of Brazil.\"\n\nWhen multiple “levels” of affiliation are listed, start with the “top-level” affiliation as a possessive followed by lower level. If the affiliations are mentioned again later in the article, only the acronym for the lowest level needs to be repeated.\n\nFor Example: For NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO), subsequent references to this entity would be “GMAO.”\n\nFor Example: For University of Maryland, Baltimore County’s Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC), subsequent references to this entity would be “ESSIC.”\n\nWhen a person is affiliated with two (or more) distinct entities, separate the two entities by slashes.\n\nFor Example: Project Scientist Felix Landerer (NASA/JPL), followed by detailed assessments of the G-FO mission and operations status from the core SDS centers and flight operations teams.\n\nWhen a NASA Center and contractor are listed, please list the NASA Center followed by contractor and separate the two entities by a slash.\n\nFor Example: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)/Global Science & Technology, Inc. (GST).\n\nCapitalize Earth, Moon, Sun\n\nNASA capitalizes the first letter in Earth, Moon, and Sun.In addition, do not use the modified ‘the’ before Earth.\n\nFor Example: This strategy acknowledges the urgency of global changes, such as accelerating environmental shifts, understanding Earth’s interconnected systems, and developing scalable information.\n\nChemical formulas\n\nChemical formulas should be treated like acronyms. Spell out a chemical formula upon first use in an article followed by the chemical formula in parenthesis. Use appropriate subscripts and superscripts in the chemical formula. From that point onward, use the chemical formula in the article.\n\nFor Example: The data show that global and East Asian emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) have decreased since 2010, contrasting India and Southeast Asia’s rising trends. In Southeast Asia, NO x and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions increased from 1990–2018, while black carbon (BC) emissions peaked in 2007.\n\nCompound words\n\nMake one word out of all compound words (e.g., multipurpose, multiangle).\n\nException: Hyphenate cases where the same vowel repeats (e.g., bio-optical, multi-imager).\n\nCross-references\n\nIt is common to reference a previous EO article to provide context and background for the current story. The Editorial Staff recommends authors cross-reference prior EOarticle. The title of the article, volume, issue, and page range in parenthesis. The information should be italicized, except for “The Earth Observer,” which should be plain text.\n\nThe name of the cross-referenced article should be hyperlinked to that article. You can find past Earth Observer newsletters on the archive page.\n\nFor Example: ESIP was created in response to a National Research Council (NRC) review of the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). (To learn more about EOSDIS, see Earth Science Data Operations: Acquiring, Distributing, and Delivering NASA Data for the Benefit of Society, in the March–April 2017 issue of The Earth Observer [Volume 29, Issue 2, pp. 4–18].) As NASA’s first Earth Observing System (EOS) missions were launching or preparing to launch, the NRC called on NASA to develop a new, distributed structure that would be operated and managed by the Earth science community and would include observation and research, application, and education data.\n\nWhen referencing a date, spell out the month, followed by the day (if included) and year. This style differs from AP. A comma always follows a year if the date is written in-line of the sentence.\n\nFor Example: January 27, 2022; January 2022\n\nFor Example: PACE launched on February 8, 2024, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\nCapitalize a season followed by a year, but not when just referring to a season.\n\nFor Example: Spring 2022; summer\n\nSpell out time zones, such as Eastern Daylight Time, and thereafter replace with the acronym (i.e., EDT).\n\nFor Example: In Cleveland, the eclipse began at 1:59 PM. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), with totality spanning 3:13–3:17 PM.\n\nDirections and regions\n\nEO articles follow AP style for directions (e.g., north, south, east, west, northeast, southwest, norther, western, southern, eastern). The directions should be lowercase when indicating a compass direction and when it is used to describe sections of states or cities.\n\nFor Example: The cold front is moving east.\n\nThe direction should be capitalized for a proper name or large regions.\n\nFor Example: NASA’s South/Southeast Asia Research Initiative (SARI) is a regional initiative under the LCLUC program that addresses the critical needs of the South/Southeast Asia region.\n\nFor Example: West Virginia or North Dakota\n\nThe Earth Observer has transitioned to an online publication. Footnotes will no longer be used in articles. Instead of footnotes, the publication will use hyperlinks to direct readers to additional content. Refer to the section on Hyperlinks for more information on how to include a hyperlink in an article. A good mantra to follow – if you are unsure if a reference is needed, leave it out.\n\nFormal titles\n\nFormal titles, such as Ms. or Dr., are used in articles that are more personal, such as Kudos, In Memoriam, and The Editor’s Corner. For all other articles, the professional title is not used. When you introduce a person in the story, present the name in BOLD followed by their agency and position in ITALICS, offset by brackets.\n\nFor Example: First Last [Agency—Job Title] began by providing an update on the status of the new launch date for the. . . .\n\nAfter the individual is introduced in the article, EO style follows a particular style for using the name again. If the individual’s name is included in the same paragraph where the person was introduced, only use the last name [UNBOLD]. If the individual is mentioned later in the article, several paragraphs removed from introduction, use the full name [FIRST LAST, UNBOLD].\n\nPrior to moving online, The Earth Observer used footnotes to reference information in an article. The online publication will now use hyperlinks to refer the reader to additional content on a topic. As a general rule, hyperlink content regarding missions, instruments, field campaigns, models, papers, and other programs named in the article. It is not necessary to link to each individual institution mentioned when individuals are identified in summaries.\n\nHow to insert a hyperlink\n\nThe first step in this process is to identify the anchor text to highlight in the sentence. The anchor text includes a word or phrase that points the reader to additional content.\n\nFor Example: Anchor text: Volume 35 Issue 6 of The Earth Observer\n\nFind the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the webpage. The URL is an address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet.\n\nFor Example: URL: https://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/eo_pdfs/EO%20Nov-Dec%202023-Digital%20508.pdf\n\nNote: When inserting a link to a prior published article from The Earth Observer’s archive, be certain to capture the URL for the first page of the referenced article, as opposed to the issue’s first page.\n\nTo insert a hyperlink, copy the URL from the website where the additional content can be found. Select the word or phrase to use as anchor text. Do not include an acronym as part of the anchor text for a hyperlink. Select the hyperlink command under the Insert dropdown menu. Paste the URL into the link box. Be sure the ‘Web Page or File’ tab is selected (not the Email tab). The hyperlinked text will appear blue and underlined.\n\nFor Example: It is possible to find this information in Volume 35 Issue 6 of The Earth Observer.\n\nFor Example: The Hyperwall presentation highlighted recent discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mission.\n\nHyphens, en dashes, and em dashes—oh my!!\n\nHyphen: - A hyphen is used to separate compound adjectives or words.\n\nFor Example: The satellite reached a near-Earth orbit.\n\nEn Dash: – An en dash spans the length of a typed lowercase ‘n.’ This special character is used to separate numbers.\n\nFor Example: The meeting was held March 5–8 in Denver, CO. [Note there is no space between the numbers in this example.]\n\nThe Earth Observer style follows the NASA style guide that uses an en dash to insert a pause in the sentence. The en dash is set apart by a space on either side. In this instance, the en dash is used instead of an em dash.\n\nFor Example: The passport identified six hidden images – all six posters from the Science Explorers Poster Series– strategically placed within the exhibit’s perimeter.\n\nYou can insert an en dash in Word on a Mac by typing the “Option” and “hyphen/dash” keys simultaneously.\n\nYou can also insert an en dash in Word using the Insert tab and select Advanced Symbols. A box will open with a variety of characters. Select “Garamond” from the Font pulldown menu (Garamond is the newsletter’s preferred font), then select the – symbol (or “en dash”) from the array of options displayed. You will then see a confirmation of your selection appear below the symbol options (i.e., “Insert [Garamond] character 150 (Unicode character 2013).” Please note: the character number (150 in the case of Garamond) could be different. For example, an en dash in Palatino font is character 208.\n\nEm Dash: — An em dash spans the length of a typed lowercase ‘m.’ This special character is used when separating the organization and the job title when introducing a person in the article. In other styles, the em dash is used as a pause in a sentence. Following NASA style guidelines, the pause is provided by the en dash.\n\nFor Example: Thomas Neumann [GSFC—Deputy Director of GSFC’s Earth Sciences Division (ESD)] welcomed meeting participants on behalf of the ESD.\n\nYou can insert an em dash in Word by going to the Insert tab and selecting Advanced Symbols. A box will open with a variety of characters. Select character 151. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the section above regarding how to insert an en dash.\n\nItalics and quotes\n\nPlace Latin phrases in ITALICS (e.g., in situ, a priori, ad hoc, ex officio) on every appearance in the article. Do not italicize abbreviated Latin phrases (e.g., i.e., a.k.a., et al.). Use the Latin phrase i.e., instead of ‘such as’ and e.g., instead of ‘that is to say.’\n\nFor Example: The Afternoon Satellite Constellation, a.k.a., the“A-Train,” can see Earth in a whole new dimension.\n\nFor Example: Guy Schumann [Water in Sight]explained this Swedish start-up company uses SWOT data to validate in situ gauge data in Malawi.\n\nPlace technical language in the text in ITALICS followed by a definition. Only use the italics on the first usage of the word.\n\nFor Example:There were several large polynyas – areas of open ice where sea ice would be expected – detected.\n\nItems in a series\n\nThe Earth Observer deviates from AP style in the use of commas in a list or series. Use the Oxford comma in a series of items.\n\nFor Example: The sensor measures at three different wavelengths corresponding to blue, green, red, and infrared light.\n\nIn more complex series where one of the items is a series of items within a series, it is permissible to use semi-colons to separate the series (see below).\n\nFor Example: The blue, green, and red channels; the two-infrared channels; and ultraviolet channel were all impacted.\n\nNumbers\n\nIn the article, spell out zero to nine. Use numerals for any number greater than or equal to 10. If a sentence contains several numbers, excluding a year, that are both greater than and less than 10, use the numerals for all numbers.\n\nFor Example: Improving the data calibrations of the acceler­ometer measurements – which are noise contaminated on one of the two G-FO spacecraft – remains a core focus of the project SDS team.\n\nFor Example: The NASA Hyperwall served as the backdrop for 57 Hyperwall Storiesat the meeting, including 8 presentations delivered by the 2023 winnersof the AGU Michael Freilich Student Visualization Competition.\n\nFor Example: Following the project team’s status presentations, there was a 30-minute session to answer questions from the science community and discuss in more detail the mission performance, near-term operations and data processing plans, as well as to gather suggestions and feedback from the community.\n\nOrdinal numbers\n\nOrdinal numbers are words representing position or rank in sequential order. The EO follows AP rules in how to present ordinal numbers in an article. Spell out one through nine and use figures for 10 and above. This rule holds for article headlines and subheads.\n\nFor Example: AEOIP Holds Third Annual Workshop\n\nFor Example: As GPM is now well into its 10th year in orbit, the time is fitting to reflect on and celebrate what this mission has accomplished and showcase its contributions to science and society.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Earth Observer is not a peer-reviewed journal and typically does not include a list of references. It is helpful to hyperlink key words/phrases to other resources, such as journal articles. See Hyperlinks section to learn how to insert and format this text.\n\nIn rare instances when a formal reference is required (e.g., referencing a Figure that originally appeared in another journal article), please use theAmerican Meteorological Society format.\n\nReferences to teams\n\nIn a story, spell out “Science Team (ST)” in the first instance and use the team acronym from that point forward in the story.\n\nFor Example: The Precipitation Measurement Mission (PMM) Science Team (ST) includes more than 20 international partners.\n\nFor other named teams, use the initial caps for the team name and then use “Team” as shorthand afterwards (e.g., “Informatics Team” first time, then abbreviate as “Team” subsequently).\n\nDo not capitalize generic references to a team (e.g., a team of experts).\n\nState abbreviations\n\nThe Earth Observer differs from AP style in how it presents state abbreviations. This publication uses the two-letter postal code for state abbreviations.\n\nFor Example: The meeting was held March 5–8 in Denver, CO.\n\nTypographical emphasis\n\nPlease do not use specialized typographic formatting (e.g., Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.). Instead, please use internal formatting (e.g., BOLD and ITALIC) as directed in the style guide (e.g., headings, subheads, author/speaker names, etc.). If you do use the specialized typographic formatting, it affects the insertion and layout of text on the EO website, which takes time to correct and slows publication.\n\nWhen inserting a table, do not use framed or shaded boxes.\n\nUnits\n\nDo not spell out units. Use the standard abbreviation. Include both English and metric units in the text. One exception is The Editor’s Corner column, which does not use both the English and metric units.\n\nFor Example: The data collected from G/G-FO has a native resolution of about 300 km (~186 mi).\n\nGuidelines for Graphics, Photos, Visualizations, Animations\n\nThe EO supports several visual options to enhance the text of an article. A figure refers to a visual display of data. An photo refers to a photograph. An animation is a series of images or model results that illustrate a concept. A visualization is a video of content.\n\nTo maintain a consistent design for The Earth Observer, please insert the graphic, photo, animation, or visualization in the appropriate location in the Word document. Along with the Word document, please submit the photo, graphic, visualization, or animation as separate files.\n\nInserting figures, photos, animations, and visualizations\n\nUpon first usage in the text, include the correct graphic descriptor (i.e., figure, photo, animation, or visualization) and appropriate number in the text in bold. Restart numbering for each visual element type (e.g., Figure 1, Photo 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Photo 2, Visualization 1).\n\nFor Example: The GMI is a 13-channel conically scanning PMW radiometer providing observations across a wide swath (885 km or ~550 mi) to estimate precipitation – see Figure 1.\n\nThe EO editorial staff ask that no additional formatting be used when inserting these files into the Word document. At the location in the text where the photo, figure, animation, or visualization should appear in the story, advance the text by two lines. Place the cursor in the first blank line. Go to the insert tab and select the picture icon. Select ‘Picture from File’ from the dropdown. Navigate to the location on your computer where the file is located and select ‘Insert.’\n\nAfter inserting the figure, photo, visualization, or animation, provide a caption and credit. It is important to think of the caption and credit as stand-alone items in the story.\n\nThe graphic may need to be revised to accommodate EO style. Remove indicators, ‘a’, b’, etc from panels or items of note. EO style requires that different panels or points of interest in the graph should use “pointers,” such as top, middle, bottom.\n\nThe caption should be descriptive and not overly technical. It should convey the content in image/figure without relying too heavily on the surrounding text to add context. Relevant links should also be added to captions.

Gizmodo has confirmed that the journal CHEST, a peer-reviewed publication on pulmonary care published by the American College of Chest Physicians, received a letter this week. And MedPage Today reports that at least two other journals have received similar intimidating letters.\n\nOne of the DOJ letters, signed by the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Edward R. Martin Jr., first went viral on social media Thursday and is addressed to the editor-in-chief of the journal CHEST, Dr. Peter Mazzone.\n\n“It has been brought to my attention that more and more journals and publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates,” the letter from Martin explains, “that is, that they have a position for which they are advocating either due to advertisement (under postal code) or sponsorship (under relevant fraud regulations). The public has certain expectations and you have certain responsibilities.”\n\nThe letter then goes on to list several questions, none of which are the purview of the U.S. Department of Justice, given the free speech protections afforded by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution:\n\nHow do you assess your responsibilities to protect the public from misinformation?\n\nHow do you clearly articulate to the public when you have certain viewpoints that are influenced by your ongoing relations with supporters, funders, advertisers, and others?\n\nDo you accept articles or essays from competing viewpoints?\n\nHow do you assess the role played by government officials and funding organizations like the National Institutes of Health in the development of submitted articles?\n\nHow do you handle allegations that authors of works in your journals may have misled their readers?\n\nThe letter went on to say, “I am also interested to know if publishers, journals, and organizations with which you work are adjusting their method of acceptance of competing viewpoints. Are there new norms being developed and offered?” while ending with a request for a response by May 2.\n\nReached for comment over email, a spokesperson for CHEST confirmed the letter’s authenticity, while noting, “its content was posted online without our knowledge.” The journal also posted a public statement online Friday affirming its editorial standards but didn’t address the DOJ letter specifically.\n\n“In its 90-year history, CHEST has published numerous articles that were breakthroughs in scientific research and clinical treatment, advancing the medical profession and improving the health and well-being of patients worldwide,” the journal said in a statement published online Friday.\n\nThe journal went on to stress the editorial standards the publication adheres to, including the ICMJE and COPE guidelines.\n\n“CHEST adheres to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICJME) and the COPE ethical guidelines for scholarly publishing, applying strict peer review standards to ensure scientific rigor,” the statement continued. “As the publisher, the American College of Chest Physicians respects and supports the journal’s editorial independence.”\n\nThe spokesperson told Gizmodo over email that legal counsel is currently reviewing the DOJ request, and the journal has no further comment at this time. It’s not yet clear which other journals cited by MedPage Today may have received the letters. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia didn’t immediately respond to questions over email Friday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has launched a war of retribution against perceived enemies, recently ordering the Department of Justice to investigate Chris Krebs, a cybersecurity expert whom Trump dislikes because he denied false claims by the president that the 2020 election had been rigged or stolen. Trump has also extorted several law firms for over a billion dollars in pro bono work, some of whom really regret their decisions to play ball, according to a recent report from the New York Times. Trump has also threatened to pull funding from major universities if they didn’t bend to his will, with many like Columbia University capitulating. Harvard University has pushed back, and Trump has reportedly told the IRS to strip the institution of its tax-exempt status.\n\nThe Society for the Rule of Law, a conservative legal group, has made a request to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel for the D.C. Court of Appeals for an investigation into several of Martin’s actions since he was appointed by President Trump to be the acting U.S. Attorney. Martin has announced investigations against his political opponents, tried to intimidate a law firm that represented Special Counsel Jack Smith, and has demonstrated “a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of a federal prosecutor,” according to the group.\n\nThe ACLU of D.C. also sent a letter back in February outlining its concerns about how Martin has threatened people over protected speech, specifically when the attorney promised legal action against anyone who takes actions to impede Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk has been unlawfully destroying the federal government, unilaterally dismantling entire agencies like USAID and cutting funding for vital services, despite not having the authority to do so. But Martin appeared to threaten anyone who hindered their activities, even by just speaking out against them.\n\nTrump is clearly trying to establish the U.S. as a fascist state, as he breaks vital government services, threatens American allies with invasion, and ships people convicted of no crime to a torture prison in El Salvador without due process. Trump has clearly ignored a Supreme Court order to return one man in particular from the CECOT prison, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, but the regime refuses to comply.\n\nAnd if history has taught us anything, it’s that the ideology of fascism is all-encompassing. Yes, they’re coming for the medical journals now, as ridiculous as that sounds. And every Trump supporter who thinks they’ll escape fascism’s wrath is sorely mistaken. In this kind of system, everyone is eventually made to prove their fealty to the leader. Anyone who makes a mistake or steps out of line, no matter how much they think they’ve proved themselves, will still feel the consequences."}

I hear all these stories, all these articles, all the Trump voters, saying they regret what they did back in 2024.” Enten remarked. “I’m here to tell you, very few of them regret what they did back in 2024.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe data guru, citing a new poll from YouGov, said that for all the talk about buyer’s remorse, a repeat of last November’s election would likely end up with the exact same result.\n\n“We’re talking just 2%. That’s not even a wide spot on the road. And then there’s this additional 1% who say they would rather not vote.” Overall, less than 5% of Trump voters would even consider changing their vote, he explained.\n\nThe poll, conducted this month, also found near-identical levels of loyalty among Harris voters, suggesting there hasn’t been a serious swing in public opinion in either direction.\n\n”The bottom line is for all this talk of Trump voters regretting their vote in the numbers, it really just doesn’t show up,” said Enten. “If there’s some idea out there that Trump voters are going around, man, I wish I had voted for Kamala Harris instead of Donald Trump, the numbers say that is a fanciful universe. It really for the most part does not exist.”\n\nWhen asked about the “stickiness” of Trump voters compared to his first presidency by co-host John Berman, Enten revealed that more Republican voters held a more negative view of the president at this point in 2017 than they do in 2025.\n\n“In February 2017, four percent of Trump voters said they’d shift their vote—that’s actually slightly more than this time around. “So you know, you look back, you say, OK, there’s these Trump voters who really regret their vote. Historically speaking, they really don’t regret their vote,” he said. “And if anything, the number this time around is actually smaller than it was the first time around and it’s certainly smaller than the number we saw coming out of 2020, of course, after the events of January 6th.”\n\nCNN’s Data Guru Reveals How Many Trump Supporters Regret Their Vote CNN\n\nA similar poll conducted by CBS earlier this month saw Trump’s popularity plummet following his disastrous tariff policies, which Enten said at the time was “the worst poll that Donald Trump has received in his second term.” 54 percent of voters said Trump is responsible for the current economic downturn, and the president’s approval ratings are currently “underwater.”\n\nBut Enten was keen to point out that pitting two people’s popularity against each other produces a different result than asking to judge them in isolation—and that the president’s current unpopularity does not translate into electoral gains for the Democrats.\n\nHe also highlighted the fact that Republicans are currently enjoying a rare lead over Democrats in terms of party recognition, with a recent poll putting them at +2% satisfaction.\n\n“If anything, the Republican brand has actually perhaps gotten a smidgen stronger, though these are within the margin of error, very different from 2017 when Democrats held a 5 point advantage,” he explained. “And I’ll finally note this looks very much like the generic ballot trend, which in 2025 looks an awful bit like November of 2024 when Republicans, of course won and held the House.”"}

This makes the dividend yield 5.3%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nTruist Financial's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained.\n\nHaving distributed dividends for at least 10 years, Truist Financial has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Despite this history however, the company's latest earnings report actually shows that it didn't have enough earnings to cover its dividends. This is an alarming sign that could mean that Truist Financial's dividend at its current rate may no longer be sustainable for longer.\n\nOver the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 174.4%. The future payout ratio could be 49% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.\n\nNYSE:TFC Historic Dividend May 3rd 2025\n\nView our latest analysis for Truist Financial\n\nTruist Financial Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.96 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.08. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.0% per annum over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.\n\nDividend Growth Potential Is Shaky\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Earnings per share has been sinking by 37% over the last five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.\n\nThe Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable\n\nOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income."}

Brook Lynn (Amanda Setton) is hiding from Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) that she gave birth to their child years ago. Lois (Rena Sofer) refuses to tell them both that the child in question is Gio (Giovanni Mazza), who is also in the dark about the family tie. Josslyn (Eden McCoy) hasn’t told any of her loved ones that she’s in the WSB, and in turn, Jack (Chris McKenna) hasn’t shared with Carly (Laura Wright) that he recruited her daughter. The list truly does go on.\n\nNow the one secret we’re going to zero in on is the one about Kristina (Kate Mansi) attempting to kill Ava (Maura West). Weeks ago, Kristina thought she was cutting the brakes to Ava’s car, but mistakenly cut the brakes to Ric’s (Rick Hearst) vehicle instead.\n\nThis, of course, led to Ric’s car crash that nearly cost him his life and that of Elizabeth’s (Rebecca Herbst). In the aftermath, Kristina has felt remorseful, but has remained quiet, thinking she’s getting away with attempted murder and not wanting to destroy her relationship with Molly (Kristen Vaganos). Kristina has no idea she should be thanking Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) for her continued freedom and newly healed relationship with her sister.\n\nNancy Lee Grahn, General Hospital (Image credit: Disney/Christine Bartolucci)\n\nSince Ava was able to get footage of Kristina in the parking garage the night of the car crash and has the car itself, Ava has been blackmailing Alexis to maintain her silence. The evidence the art gallery owner has could lead to Kristina’s arrest, and Alexis, being a protective mother, doesn’t want to see that happen. So, the attorney has been embezzling money from the Cassadine Estate to pay Ava hush money.\n\nHaving said all of that, Kristina is bound to find out the lengths her mother is going to in order to protect her. This revelation could happen thanks to a conversation Kristina overhears between Alexis and Ava or Alexis and Diane (Carolyn Hennesy), or Kristina could learn of this blackmail secret by some other means. Regardless of how she learns, we venture to say she’s bound to be stunned.\n\nMaura West, General Hospital (Image credit: Disney)\n\nWith the truth, we imagine Kristina is bound to do one of two things. If she sticks to type, then she’s going to explode. Ironically, this could lead to another heated confrontation with Ava, as Kristina likely wouldn’t care for Ava blackmailing her mother. Would Kristina then attempt to finish what she started, and make another attempt on Ava’s life, feeling it’s the only way to deal with Ava once and for all?\n\nThere’s also a chance that Kristina will shock us, and when she learns of Ava’s blackmail, she voluntarily decides to check herself into the mental health facility. While a move like this could ultimately mean Kristina stands trial for her crimes, we’d venture to say she has a chance of not going to prison due to a not guilty plea by reason of insanity. But even if she escapes prison, that may not spare Kristina the wrath of Molly.\n\nGet the What to Watch Newsletter The latest updates, reviews and unmissable series to watch and more!

Are there legal limits?\n\ntoggle caption David Swanson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAs President Trump expands the use of the military in immigration enforcement, this nearly 150-year-old law has come into sharp focus.\n\nThe Posse Comitatus Act was designed to limit the use of federal troops in law enforcement activities on American soil. The rule has its exceptions and loopholes, but Trump's second term and his crackdown on immigration are shaping up to be a major test of the law.\n\nToday, thousands of active-duty troops are deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border. What the military is allowed to do there has also dramatically shifted — going beyond the typical roles of supporting the Border Patrol.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAmong the most significant developments came last month, when Trump designated a 170-mile stretch of federal land along the southern border — which spans through California, Arizona and New Mexico — as a military installation, or a national defense area.\n\nOn Thursday, the Department of Defense announced that a second section in Texas will be marked as a military installation.\n\nAt least 82 people have been federally charged for \"unauthorized entry\" into the newly created National Defense Area in New Mexico as a result.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nWhat are the restrictions under the Posse Comitatus Act?\n\nThe federal law was enacted in 1878 following the Civil War, when former Confederate states were either unwilling or unable to enforce civil laws. In response, the federal government stepped in and deployed active-duty troops to maintain order. That led to concerns of potential military overreach.\n\nWhile the law came after the Civil War, it's rooted in one of the country's founding principles, which is the rejection of military involvement in civilian affairs. The ideal was a key grievance in the Declaration of Independence, which was later reflected in the Articles of Confederation and the Bill of Rights.\n\nIn practice, the law prohibits federal armed forces from taking part in civilian law enforcement, like conducting searches, seizures and arrests on American streets, except when \"expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.\"\n\nThis restriction applies to the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Space Force. On the other hand, the Coast Guard is exempt. The same goes for the National Guard, as it typically operates under state authority. However, Guard units become bound to the Posse Comitatus Act when they are called into federal service.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn some cases, the National Guard has served federal interests on state orders. For instance, in 2020, 11 states sent their National Guard troops to Washington D.C., to help respond to the protests over George Floyd's murder.\n\nWhat about the new national defense area?\n\nNational Guard and federal military forces have been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico Border under previous administrations, generally in support roles to the Border Patrol, such as providing equipment, logistics and surveillance.\n\nNow, federal military personnel will be allowed to temporarily detain and search people who are considered trespassing on the newly established national defense area at the southern border — effectively bypassing the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\n\" By doing this, he's sort of supercharging or empowering the military to be heavily involved in the immigration enforcement mission in ways they weren't before,\" said Mark Nevitt, a professor at Emory University School of Law who served as an attorney with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG).\n\nNevitt added that typically a president would need congressional approval to designate a military zone. But Trump was able to sidestep this requirement because he had declared a national emergency at the southern border on his first day in office, which thereby authorizes military construction projects, Nevitt wrote in Just Security.\n\ntoggle caption Army Pfc. Sean Hoch/U.S. Department of Defense\n\nDan Maurer, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army JAG, also raised concerns about the lack of clarity on how much force troops will be allowed to use against people trespassing the new military installation. In the White House's memorandum NSPM-4 regarding the new designation, it states that armed forces will \"follow rules for the use of force.\"\n\nIn Lawfare, Maurer wrote that while those rules usually align with domestic law enforcement standards and the Constitution, they also allow deadly force to protect sensitive property. The situation is further complicated by Trump's framing that the border is facing an \"invasion\" and \"under attack.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Hence the blurring of law enforcement and military operations can lead to ambiguity as to what role they're serving in and thus what force is truly authorized, legal, and reasonable,\" Maurer told NPR.\n\nNevitt worries that blurring the line between military and law enforcement roles could also undermine military readiness, as well as hurt military recruitment and retention.\n\n\"Most people join the military to fight and defend this country, defend their national security interests, deploy overseas,\" he said. \"Not (to) be a domestic law enforcer.\"\n\nThe sweeping exception that Trump has not used yet\n\ntoggle caption Paul Sakuma/AP\n\nA key exception to the Posse Comitatus Act is the Insurrection Act, which gives the president the authority to call on the military during an emergency to curb unrest or rebellion within the U.S.\n\nThe Insurrection Act has been used about 30 times in American history, largely to quell civil unrest. It was last invoked in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush sent Army and Marine troops to Los Angeles to help quell the violence following the acquittal of the police officers who beat Rodney King. It has never been used for immigration enforcement.\n\nThe Insurrection Act can be more concerning than the Alien Enemies Act, which Trump has invoked to detain and deport Venezuelan immigrants, according to Maurer, who is now a professor at the Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law.\n\nLast week, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the president's use of the Alien Enemies Act was \"unlawful.\" Meanwhile, in 1827, the Supreme Court established that the president has the sole authority to invoke the Insurrection Act.\n\n\" But with the Insurrection Act, we already have case law that says courts can't really second guess the decision,\" he said."}

I write articles occasionally as a freelance journalist, but I can't sugarcoat it: I'm a stay-at-home mom. Even typing it, I cringe a little.\n\nBefore becoming a stay-at-home, I saw my friends who were well-off and stay-at-home moms. Their days seemed to be all about lunches and playing tennis.\n\nI was judgmental, for sure. I used to think, \"Must be nice.\"\n\nNow I know — yes, it is nice, but it's also a very challenging job.\n\nMy life took an unexpected turn after getting pregnant\n\nWhen I was 25, I moved to Los Angeles with big dreams of working in Hollywood as a sitcom writer. That didn't pan out, but I did meet my husband.\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, it was even harder to find a steady job in television so I took a position in podcasting. I was there a little over a year but left when things went south — the company declared bankruptcy a few months later. I was also newly pregnant.\n\nI didn't look for a new full-time job while pregnant. Becoming a sitcom writer had been an uphill battle and one I was ready to give up. I took a few short-term contract positions, and after giving birth to my son, I wasn't working at all.\n\nWhen I finally started to consider working again, there'd been a shift in the podcasting openings I found — many producer roles also required editing experience, which wasn't a skill I had or was interested in.\n\nSince becoming a mother, I can't seem to find a career path that excites me\n\nI'm a self-admitted lost soul when it comes to a career. I still look for jobs and often apply.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nHowever, when I really think about what it would mean to take any of the jobs I apply for, sadness washes over me at the thought of being away from my son.\n\nMaybe it's time to accept what I do feel passionate about: my son.\n\nAlso, if I returned to work I would need to find childcare since a day job would likely go to 5 p.m. and my son is out of preschool by 3 p.m. Plus, my son only goes to preschool three days a week.\n\nWhether it's day care or a nanny, the amount of money it would cost makes taking any job less appealing. It's just not worth it.\n\nIf I had a clear career trajectory, it might be a different story.\n\nI was surprised that I enjoy being a stay-at-home mom\n\nI was with my son every single day until he started preschool at 1 ½ years old. I was there for all the milestones: first word, steps, giggles.\n\nI was amazed at how this helpless being transformed into a chatty toddler, full of personality, right before my eyes. Though cliché, it was true: The days are long but the years are short.\n\nOf course, some days are just hard. His naps offer me a much-needed break but then sometimes they don't happen. Food gets thrown on the just-washed floor. If he doesn't have a cold, then he has a stomach bug. It feels like a week without an illness is a rarity.\n\nEven now that's he in school part time, my hours alone fly by, and I never accomplish all the to-dos I hope to. At 3 p.m. I switch back to mom duty and I must entertain him, keep him away from the remote (although sometimes you just have to put on the TV), and manage his multistep bedtime routine.\n\nEven with all the trying moments, I've realized I'm the happiest I've ever been. My son makes me laugh constantly, and I can't tell him enough how much I love him.\n\nI am privileged that my family can afford to live on my husband's salary alone. An additional salary would certainly be helpful, but the opportunity cost of me finding work — and not spending my days with my son — is too high.\n\nMy name may not be in the credits of your favorite comedy show, but I know people whose names are and I wouldn't trade places with any of them.\n\nAlthough my days may not be glamorous and are often monotonous, I love my life as a stay-at-home mom."}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nI moved from the US to France with my French partner, two suitcases, and my American optimism.\n\nHe had thrived as an international student in the US, so I assumed I'd adapt just as easily as a young professional in Paris.\n\nHowever, after we got married, I struggled to adjust — and I coped by comparing my new life to my old one.\n\nIt took me a while to absorb the best piece of advice I received as an expat\n\nI was lucky to find an international friend group shortly after my move.\n\nOne day, while venting to one of them about how I missed American salaries, holidays, and even my family dentist, she stopped me and simply said, \"You can't compare.\"\n\nAt the time, I knew she was right, but didn't want to hear it. However, as the years passed, I realized it was the best advice about moving abroad I'd ever received.\n\nComparison is natural — after all, how often do we see articles ranking countries against each other? Although this can be useful, constantly measuring my old life, comfort level, and norms against my new ones only made me blind to everything France had given me.\n\nAdjusting to a new place can take years — and that's OK\n\nIt's been fun getting to explore Italy and other parts of Europe while based in France. Grace Brennan\n\nI've heard people say it takes two years to feel at home in a new country. For me, it took four (plus a gap year in London and a move to the South of France, where my husband is from).\n\nThe turning point came when I finally stopped comparing my life to what could've been.\n\nYes, I make less money here, and seeing my friends back home land impressive salaries can make me question my path. Since I left, I've only been home once for Thanksgiving, and celebrating away from family and missing weddings and funerals never gets easier.\n\nPlus, I still miss little things, like SoulCycle and Trader Joe's, more often than I'd like to admit. However, I've got so much to appreciate about my new life in France.\n\nI work less, stress less, and have had the space to reassess my career. I became self-employed, started lecturing in an English program at a French university at 25, and built a new life centered on my passions for writing, music, and nonprofit work.\n\nI've made new friends from all over the world who have become like family. I also appreciate the support, patience, and grace of my community back home more than ever. Plus, I've had the joy of hosting many of them here, sharing our home and life in ways I never could have if I'd stayed in the US.\n\nMost importantly, I've developed a deep gratitude for how my husband's country has shaped him and welcomed me.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nThese days, I focus on having gratitude for all my new country has given me\n\nWhile I plan my future in France, I remain incredibly grateful for where I grew up. The US will always be a part of me, and I wouldn't trade my American upbringing or university experience for anything.\n\nI still have bittersweet moments, like realizing my future kids' childhood won't look anything like mine. However, now, those feelings are balanced by the excitement of getting to see them experience their own culture in one of the most beautiful countries.\n\nFor anyone who has recently moved abroad or is considering it, all I can say is this: The best thing I ever did was stop comparing and start appreciating both where I'm at and where I'm from."}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nEntrepreneurs John Coogan and Jordi Hays appeared in a YouTube video last October in rumpled T-shirts. For an hour, they riffed on the week's tech news and launched their talk show, \"Technology Brothers,\" with an unapologetic swagger.\n\nCoogan, who cofounded the once-hyped meal replacement startup Soylent, and Hays, the cofounder of a fundraising startup, have since ditched the tech bro T-shirts for crisp suits, big personalities, and even bigger hair. Their daily show, now rebranded as \"TBPN,\" short for the \"Technology Business Programming Network,\" has evolved into a sports talk show-like livestream where tech founders and investors call in for 15-minute interview slots.\n\n\"The name 'tech bros' had been a slur, right?\" Hays told Business Insider. \"We wanted to reclaim that word in a fun way by saying, 'No, we're not tech bros — we're technology brothers.'\"\n\nSo far, the show's guest list has included star venture capitalists like Keith Rabois, Trae Stephens, and Garry Tan, as well as Plaid CEO Zach Perret and Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen. In just a few months, \"TBPN\" has amassed a few thousand YouTube subscribers while publishing daily on Spotify and Apple Podcasts. Its X account has nearly 40,000 followers.\n\nThe duo's calculated charisma has sparked a social storm because of its redux of the podcast, a played-out format in tech and venture capital. Many main character-coded investors and tech luminaries have podcasts of their own — from Harry Stebbings' \"The Twenty Minute VC\" to the \"All-In Podcast,\" where Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg hold court online.\n\nFans of the show are also driving \"TBPN\"'s fame: \"None of the men posting these have the courage to call @johncoogan and @jordihays hot outright,\" Erika Bricky, who works at a fintech startup, wrote on X. \"Which is actually what we've been missing in tech pod hosts.\"\n\nNot just another tech podcast\n\nCoogan has \"never really had a real full time job,\" he said, but has built a roster of companies. In 2013, Coogan cofounded Soylent, which quickly amassed a cult following. After Soylent, he cofounded Lucy, which makes nicotine gum and pouches. He's also an entrepreneur in residence at Peter Thiel's Founders Fund.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n\"TBPN\" isn't Coogan's first time running a tech media playbook. He skims The Wall Street Journal in print while lounging in his gym's sauna every morning and channeled that ritual into content during the pandemic with a news-driven YouTube channel that has nearly half a million subscribers.\n\nIn college, Hays built a YouTube ad network to help podcasts monetize. He then started fintech company Party Round, later renamed Capital, which helped startup founders raise money. Capital was acquired by the business banking platform Rho in 2023. Hays also angel invests in early-stage startups and advises others, like Coogan's Lucy.\n\nThe pair decided to take their idea for a founder-friendly talk show more seriously late last year. \"We were joking that technology needs a podcast,\" Coogan said. \"Because, obviously, there's a ton.\"\n\nTwo months after their first episode in October 2024, Coogan and Hays were uploading three episodes a week.\n\nIn January, they began featuring guests and moved to broadcasting every weekday. Episodes are shot live, and interviews with founders are unedited. On a good day, like last week's defense tech-focused show, \"TBPN\" interviews 10 people, though usually they average four to six guests. Coogan and Hays also react to articles of interest, like an Economist story on defense tech's rise in Silicon Valley.\n\n\"TBPN\" has not raised any money from venture investors and doesn't plan to, Coogan said. The company relies on advertising revenue from sponsors like fintech company Ramp and bed cooling system startup Eight Sleep.\n\nThe show currently runs lean, with a small crew of editors and three full-time staffers who handle production. Coogan said that, in a bid to level up its content, \"TBPN\" is close to signing a lease on a Hollywood soundstage.\n\n'Digitally-native news anchors'\n\nPerhaps \"TBPN\" has gained appeal because Coogan and Hays are both investors and operators, David Zagaynov, cofounder and CEO of Poseidon Aerospace, wrote to BI in an email. He appeared on \"TBPN\" on April 1, the day after his company launched out of stealth.\n\nAlthough \"TBPN\" is relatively new to the tech podcast scene, a guest appearance has become a signal to some in the startup ecosystem: \"I now only respond to VC cold emails/DMs if they've been on @tbpn,\" Cy Sack, head of business systems at Anduril, wrote on X. \"Serious alpha,\" Seven Seven Six investor Alexis Ohanian, who has been on the show, responded.\n\nCoogan and Hays don't pretend to be journalists. They think of themselves as \"digitally-native news anchors,\" Hays said.\n\nThey aren't venture capitalists either (though they do occasionally angel invest). While some of their tech brethren have raised funds off their podcast momentum (Stebbings, for example, started 20VC's fund in 2020 after his podcast took off), the pair has different intentions.\n\n\"We want to do what we're doing now for decades,\" Hays said. \"We're not doing this so that in a year we can raise a fund.\""}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nEver since I was a little girl, I wanted to be a print journalist. In high school, a few teachers tried to steer me in a different direction because getting a job in the media was so difficult even then, but I was determined to make it happen.\n\nI studied for a double degree in journalism and business management and graduated in 2007. Despite the naysayers, I immediately landed a full-time cadetship job at a newspaper. I believe three things got me over the line.\n\nI did as much work experience as possible\n\nWhen I wasn't at university, I did as much work experience as I could. While my friends were busy enjoying their time off school by going to the beach or the movies, I was cutting my teeth in a newsroom. My degree required a minimum of one internship, but I wanted to do extras.\n\nI often found it super intimidating and felt out of my depth, but I gained real-world experience that proved to be invaluable. Doing work experience meant that by the time I graduated and was out there looking for a job, I already had my byline published in multiple publications and a portfolio of work to show prospective employers.\n\nIn my one and only job interview, the chief of staff wasn't interested in my university grades. In fact, I don't think he even asked about them. He wanted to see examples of my published work. The work experience I'd done definitely paid off.\n\nI persevered\n\nWhere I lived on the Gold Coast in Australia, there was only one daily newspaper, the Gold Coast Bulletin, and I was desperate to work for them.\n\nBack then, there was a scholarship program that high school seniors could apply for. It was a four-year program alternating work and study, with a guaranteed position as a newspaper journalist upon completion. Successful candidates could study for their Bachelor of Journalism at Bond University and work as a paid cadet journalist at the Gold Coast Bulletin on a semester-on, semester-off basis. I applied, but I missed out.\n\nEven though I was extremely disappointed, I didn't let it discourage me. They say that there are many pathways to the same destination, and it's so true. I went to university for four years, then reapplied for a job with the Gold Coast Bulletin in 2007.\n\nWhen I called and asked the chief of staff if they had any work available, he said they didn't. I dropped off my résumé and portfolio anyway with reception. Later that afternoon, he called me back and said to come for an interview.\n\nThe chief of staff gave me a chance and offered me a position on the copy desk, which basically involved answering phones and writing about kids' sporting achievements. It opened a door, and I was grateful that my perseverance paid off.\n\nI was realistic about having to work my way up\n\nThough the copy desk wasn't exactly where I wanted to be, the newsroom was, and I knew that I had to start somewhere.\n\nI'd also conceded that if I didn't land a job at the Gold Coast, I was willing to move elsewhere to get started in a career in journalism. I think that being flexible and having realistic expectations about working your way up to where you want to be is really important as a graduate.\n\nI ended up working at the Gold Coast Bulletin for three years, then traveling and working odd jobs while overseas. I returned to a newsroom as a print journalist in Melbourne in 2014, and then in 2015, I started my own copywriting business. Nowadays, I work from home and write freelance parenting, travel, and lifestyle articles for a range of publications. I still love my work.\n\nI always tell my kids to reach for the stars and follow their dreams, even if they seem difficult to achieve. I did, and I never looked back."}

Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BI\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nA data point caught my eye recently. Bots generate more internet traffic to websites than humans now, the cybersecurity company Thales says.\n\nThis is being driven by a swarm of web crawlers unleashed by Big Tech companies and AI labs, including Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, that slurp up copyrighted content for free.\n\nI've warned about these automated scrapers before. They're increasingly sophisticated and persistent in their quest to harvest information to feed the insatiable demand for AI training datasets. These bots not only take data without permission or payment but also cause traffic surges in some parts of the internet, increasing costs for website owners and content creators.\n\nThankfully, there's a new way to thwart this bot swarm. If you're struggling to block them, you can send them down new digital rabbit holes where they ingest content garbage. One software developer recently called this \"diabolical\" — in a good way.\n\nAbsolutely diabolical Cloudflare feature. love to see it pic.twitter.com/k8WX2PdANN — hibakod (@hibakod) April 25, 2025\n\nIt's called AI Labyrinth, and it's a tool from Cloudflare. Described as a \"new mitigation approach,\" AI Labyrinth uses generative AI not to inform but to mislead. When Cloudflare detects unauthorized activity, typically from bots ignoring \"no crawl\" directives, it deploys a trap: a maze of convincingly real but irrelevant AI-generated content designed to waste bots' time and chew through AI companies' computing power.\n\nCloudflare pledged in a recent announcement that this is only the first iteration of using generative artificial intelligence to thwart bots.\n\nDigital gibberish\n\nUnlike traditional honeypots, AI Labyrinth creates entire networks of linked pages invisible to humans but highly attractive to bots. These decoy pages don't affect search engine optimization and aren't indexed by search engines. They are specifically tailored to bots, which get ensnared in a meaningless loop of digital gibberish.\n\nWhen bots follow the maze deeper, they inadvertently reveal their behavior, allowing Cloudflare to fingerprint and catalog them. These data points feed directly into Cloudflare's evolving machine learning models, strengthening future detection for customers.\n\nWill Allen, the vice president of product at Cloudflare, told me that more than 800,000 domains had fired up the company's general AI bot blocking tool. AI Labyrinth is the next weapon to wield when sneaky AI companies get around blockers.\n\nCloudflare hasn't released data on how many customers use AI Labyrinth, which suggests it's too early for major adoption. \"It's still very new, so we haven't released that particular data point yet,\" Allen said.\n\nI asked him why AI bots are still so active if most of the internet's data has already been scraped for model training.\n\n\"New content,\" Allen said. \"If I search for 'what are the best restaurants in San Francisco,' showing high-quality content from the past week is much better than information from a year or two prior that might be out of date.\"\n\nTurning AI against itself\n\nBots are not just scraping old blog posts; they're hungry for the freshest data to keep AI outputs relevant.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nCloudflare's strategy flips this demand on its head. Instead of serving up valuable new content to unauthorized scrapers, it offers them an endless buffet of synthetic articles, each more irrelevant than the last.\n\nAs AI scrapers become more common, innovative defenses like AI Labyrinth are becoming essential. By turning AI against itself, Cloudflare has introduced a clever layer of defense that doesn't just block bad actors but also exhausts them.\n\nFor web admins, enabling AI Labyrinth is as easy as toggling a switch on the Cloudflare dashboard. It's a small step that could make a big difference in protecting original content from unauthorized exploitation in the age of AI."}

There was a lot of interesting topics in April from the launch of the Framework Laptop 13 powered by AMD Strix Point, an interesting and cheap RISC-V board coming about, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 proving to be an interesting low-power Linux laptop, Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora 42 releasing, and much more.Below is a recap of all the interesting highlights for April 2025 on Phoronix. Before getting to those most popular articles for the month, it's time for the usual reminder... If you enjoy the original Linux/open-source-focused content put out each and every single day on Phoronix, please consider showing your support or at least not using any ad-blocker when viewing this site. Subscribing to Phoronix Premium allows for viewing multi-page articles on a single page, ad-free experience, native dark mode, and other benefits while supporting this site. Tips via PayPal and Stripe also are graciously accepted. Today's macro environment only continues to add more pressure on the already tight web ad-based publishing industry, especially for the Linux niche where relying entirely on ad networks for the ad fill. Rampant ad-block use is a persistent sword in my side and just makes it all the more challenging for those looking at Phoronix for Linux hardware reviews, often exclusive performance tests, and other content seldom found elsewhere. Thanks for your support as Phoronix approaches its 21st birthday next month.With that out of the way, the most popular featured articles/reviews for April included:Today the review embargo lifts on the Framework 13 with AMD Ryzen AI 300 \"Strix Point\" SoCs: wow, what an upgrade! I've spent the past week testing out the Framework 13 with the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and it's been terrific. Framework 13's modularity continues to pay off and allows easily upgrading to the new Strix Point bearing motherboard with AMD Zen 5 CPU cores and the Radeon 890M (RDNA 3.5) integrated graphics. If you are on a fresh Linux distribution the support is in great shape and paired with great performance for delivering a great 2025 Linux laptop option.The Framework Laptop 13 with AMD Strix Point is now shipping that as detailed in our review earlier this month can provide for a very capable Linux laptop for Linux developers, creators, and enthusiasts. But for those hesitant about the high price and still weeks away before they have shipped all their pre-orders, if you are principally concerned about battery life, and/or after proven build quality backed by on-site warranty and other warranty/support options, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition ends up being a solid option for a very reliable and well-engineered laptop for Linux use. Here is a look at the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition on Linux that is powered by Intel Lunar Lake.With both Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora 42 releasing this month you may be curious how these two Linux distributions are competing for performance. Well, it's a very tight race for common Intel/AMD x86_64 hardware. In this article are some benchmarks looking at clean installs of Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora Workstation 42 on AMD Strix Point.Last week I posted some initial GNOME 48 and KDE Plasma 6.3 desktop gaming benchmarks on Ubuntu 25.04 beta for looking at the performance of those two leading desktop options for this upcoming Ubuntu Linux release. Both GNOME and KDE under Wayland were outperforming KDE on X11 (and GNOME on X11 wasn't even working due to bugs). Some Phoronix readers questioned though whether the Wayland advantage on GNOME/KDE was due to those desktops losing focus on X11 support or if they are just too bloated. So for adding some additional context, here are some graphics/gaming benchmarks on the same system hardware/software when adding in the Xfce 4.20 and LXQt 2.1 X11 desktops.Earlier this month was a look at the AMD RDNA 3.5 graphics between Windows 11 and Ubuntu 25.04 using a Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 \"Strix Point\" SoC within a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6. That was an interesting benchmark battle and providing a fresh look at the open-source AMD Linux graphics driver stack relative to Radeon Software on Windows. For those curious about the current Zen 5(C) performance, today's article are all of the CPU benchmarks for the AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 performance under the newly-released Ubuntu 25.04 and Windows 11 as pre-loaded by Lenovo.For those that are curious about the Linux support and performance of the AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 laptop processor, I've recently been testing it out within a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 (AMD) laptop. Up today are benchmarks of the Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 within the ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 up against an assortment of other recent Intel and AMD laptops all while running the near-final state of Ubuntu 25.04.Earlier this month Canonical announced Ubuntu Linux support for the Orange Pi RV2 as a low-cost RISC-V developer board. The Orange Pi RV2 with eight RISC-V cores and 8GB of RAM costs just around $64 USD. The price point and specs were interesting that I ordered one and have been running performance benchmarks on it since for seeing how capable this is as finally an interesting, low-cost and readily available RISC-V board.Today's Linux benchmarking at Phoronix is looking at how the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K performance has evolved since its launch last October. Taking the launch-day benchmarks from October with the same hardware, we are revisiting the Intel Arrow Lake performance under Linux today using the newest system BIOS and the newly-released Ubuntu 25.04 for seeing how the performance has evolved roughly over the past half-year.Earlier this week the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti launched and there were launch-day Linux CUDA/OpenCL compute benchmarks on Phoronix. But for the Linux gaming performance tests we were waiting on a new supported driver release, which happened to be on launch day with the NVIDIA 575.51.02 Linux beta. Now that the gaming-ready Linux driver is available for the GeForce RTX 5060 series, here are some initial benchmarks of the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB up against other NVIDIA GeForce and AMD Radeon graphics cards using the newly-released Ubuntu 25.04.This week Intel announced \"200S Boost\" for Core Ultra \"Arrow Lake\" K-Series desktop processors as effectively a new overclocking profile rolling out to existing Z890 motherboards via a BIOS update. Enabling the 200S Boost profile is said to help with low-latency workloads like gaming by allowing higher fabric / die-to-die / memory frequencies. While some Windows benchmarks have begun emerging for the Intel 200S Boost mode and some limited gains, I was curious about the performance under Linux so here are some 200S Boost benchmarks with the Core Ultra 9 285K on Ubuntu 25.04.And the most viewed news for the month:Linus Torvalds is sharing some of his classic and straight-to-the-point wisdom today over file-systems with case-folding / case-insensitive file and folder support.AMD has published as open-source their \"GPU-IOV Module\" used for virtualization with Instinct accelerators. It's also reported on their roadmap for bringing virtualization support to their client (Radeon) discrete GPUs.Arch Linux is the latest Linux distribution replacing its Redis packages with the Valkey fork.Well here is a pleasant surprise, especially for those that recall the days long ago where Fedora Linux releases tend to be notoriously delayed... Fedora 42 is cleared for releasing next week Tuesday, 15 April, in meeting its \"early target\" release date.APT 3.0 has been officially released as the first stable version following an interesting development cycle. APT 3.0 has been dedicated to the late Steve Langasek with his many Debian and Ubuntu contributions over the years.It's been a very exciting week in the KDE Plasma space with the start of a big new feature landing for the Plasma 6.4 desktop.Fedora 42 is out today as a fabulous update to this prominent leading-edge Linux distribution sponsored by Red Hat. I've been running Fedora 42 on several systems already -- including upgrading my main production system to it -- and it's been working out very well. Fedora 42 is packed full of new features and software updates making it a great H1'2025 Linux operating system release.Following the COSMIC Alpha 6 release from February, System76 today released COSMIC Alpha 7 as their last planned alpha release for this open-source, Rust-written desktop environment designed around the needs of their Pop!_OS Linux distribution.GNOME 48 made Decibels the desktop's official audio player and in doing so also became the first GNOME core application written in the TypeScript porting language. There's now a second core app for GNOME written in TypeScript.KDE developers continue to be very busy working toward the Plasma 6.4 desktop release and making other enhancements throughout this open-source desktop.Last year work on KDE's Amarok music player was resurrected after a six year development hiatus. With the return to Amarok development it was ported to Qt6 and KDE Frameworks 5. At the end of last year Amarok 3.2 released with initial Qt6 and KDE Frameworks 6 support while retaining Qt5/KF5 support. Now out today is the Amarok 3.3 beta to drop that prior-generation support.After several ROCm 6.3 point releases, AMD today rolled out ROCm 6.4 as the next update to their open-source GPU/accelerator compute stack and ahead of their big Advancing AI event in June where they will talk about future ROCm work.As a win for the open-source community from NVIDIA, the company recently announced they are making their PhysX and Flow GPU-accelerated source code open-source.For those looking to replace their proprietary BIOS with the open-source Coreboot on a supported platform or are already doing so, Coreboot 25.03 is out today to provide the newest capabilities for this open-source BIOS/firmware solution.Sven Peter who remains one of the very active Asahi Linux developers and working on upstreaming various elements of Apple Silicon support for the Linux kernel has sent up warning flares around the eventual Apple M4 support.Valve and CodeWeavers today announced the much anticipated beta release of Proton 10.0 as the newest version of their downstream version of Wine that powers Steam Play for running Windows games on Linux.Back in March some ideas were talked about by Canonical engineers for Ubuntu Linux to move to Rust Coreutils and other Rust-written system components. Some of this is likely to materialize for the Ubuntu 25.10 release due out in October to allow for sufficient testing ahead of the all important Ubuntu 26.04 LTS release next year. Today the more solidified plans have been laid out for moving to the Rust Coreutils as a replacement to GNU Coreutils with Ubuntu 25.10.A set of Linux kernel patches posted today by longtime Linux kernel developer Ingo Molnar are looking to remove support for \"ancient\" 32-bit CPUs. In particular, if these patches are accepted, the Linux kernel would be ending support for old i486 CPUs as well as early i586 CPU models.A request for comments (RFC) patch series sent out this week for the Linux kernel is working on the notion of Virtual Swap Space support. The notion of Virtual Swap Space has been talked about for years and even going back to 2011 there's been efforts to redesign the kernel's swap cache along similar lines.Following IBM engineers doing a lot of open-source compiler work around a new \"arch15\" that we suspected to be IBM z17 with Telum II processors, this morning IBM officially announced their next-generation mainframe hardware."}

This leads to a fascinating roguelike mechanic, one where you need to create the best path to reach the fabled Room 46. Our Blue Prince guides hub has all the tips you need to help you get started with this deep dive into untold mysteries.\n\nBlue Prince guides hub\n\nOur Blue Prince guides hub is organized into several sections. We focused on individual puzzle rooms, followed by boons that you can unlock permanently. We also discuss progression--i.e. reaching the Antechamber and Room 46--as well as activities beyond that point. Naturally, these articles contain spoilers, so read them at your own risk.\n\nThe basics\n\nThese Blue Prince guides are all about the basics, such as the items that you might want for your runs and the resources that you need for continued exploration. We also mention a few tips about drafting rooms and advancing further into the estate.\n\nPuzzles and challenges\n\nTo be fair, Blue Prince has countless puzzles, including those that lead to even more secrets and cryptic clues. The ones that we've included here are those found in puzzle rooms. Some are fairly straightforward--i.e. logic and math--but others become more complex. There are even tasks with incremental difficulty increases if you complete them often.\n\nPasswords, safe codes, and locked containers\n\nIn some areas in the game, you need to learn the correct password or numerical combination just to earn some goodies. These Blue Prince guides focus on these particular tasks.\n\nPermanent upgrades\n\nOther puzzles, meanwhile, grant permanent upgrades. These include bonus gems, additional steps, and even a means of activating offline terminals. We've also included those that unlock new locations.\n\nProgression and exploration: The Antechamber, Room 46, and the Underground\n\nAs mentioned earlier, your main objective in Blue Prince is to reach Room 46, but that's easier said than done. Randomness--i.e. the RNG--won't always be in your favor. There are many challenges, as well as surprises that are both delightful and frustrating, that await you on your journey. Oh, and be forewarned that many of these guides contain spoilers.\n\nThe Manor\n\nThe Underground\n\nPost-campaign secrets and meta arcs: Spoiler-heavy guides\n\nWhile the above guides do contain spoilers, the ones in this section are on another level completely. You know the risk when you click on these spoilers. In any case, these are just a few of the activities that you can tackle well after your first visit to Room 46:\n\nThe Estate Grounds\n\nSanctum Key arc:\n\nCastle Cipher and Throne Room arc:\n\nNumeric Cores and Atelier arc:\n\nThere are numerous discoveries that await in this strange manor as you continue to play each day.

Staff Sgt. Fred Brown/US Army\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe United States will begin withdrawing hundreds of troops from northeast Syria in coming months, a sign that it believes its Kurdish partners and the new Syrian government can keep ISIS extremists from reorganizing.\n\nThe US troops in Syria have assisted its local partner, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, in the fight against ISIS since 2015. The presence was always relatively small, never exceeding 2,500, and is being reduced to below 1,000.\n\n\"This consolidation reflects the significant steps we have made toward degrading ISIS' appeal and operational capability regionally and globally,\" Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a Friday statement. \"This deliberate and conditions-based process will bring the US footprint in Syria down to less than a thousand US forces in the coming months.\"\n\n\"The US is likely to keep a small residual force in Syria to conduct targeted raids against ISIS,\" Nicholas Heras, senior director of strategy and innovation at the New Lines Institute, told Business Insider. \"The US is also likely to keep the base in Erbil (Iraqi Kurdistan) as a hub to surge forces into Syria, as needed.\"\n\n\"These factors would mean that a phased US withdrawal from Syria would be less likely to be chaotic, and more likely to adhere to a typical reduction in force.\"\n\nIn October 2019, two years after ISIS lost its self-styled caliphate's de-facto capital to the US-led coalition, President Donald Trump ordered an abrupt withdrawal, triggering a brief but destructive and destabilizing cross-border Turkish operation against the SDF. Trump ultimately postponed that hasty withdrawal and the US maintained a smaller deployment of about 900 personnel.\n\nThe latest drawdown takes place under significantly different circumstances.\n\n\"The 2019 withdrawal was so chaotic because it was a snap decision that the US administration wasn't adequately prepared for, and which senior officials in the administration were outraged by,\" Aron Lund, a fellow with Century International and a senior analyst at the Swedish Defense Research Agency, told BI.\n\n\"You don't have that situation today,\" Lund said, adding that, unlike the previous Trump administration, there are no officials who would likely resign in protest as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis did.\n\nIn December, after the overthrow of long-time Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, the US disclosed that it had 2,000 troops in Syria. It clarified that those additional 1,100 were \"temporary rotational forces\" and the remaining 900 \"core\" assets.\n\nSoldiers with the 10th Mountain Division provided security after departing a CH-47 Chinook during air assault training with Syrian partners at Al-Tanf Garrison, Syria, in February.

Caggins III, a senior nonresident fellow at the New Lines Institute, retired US Army colonel, and former spokesman for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, believes Washington would be \"well-served\" in continuing its Syria deployment.\n\n\"During the first Trump administration, the US-led global Coalition defeated ISIS by supporting the Kurdish-led SDF,\" Caggins told BI. \"It is important for President Trump to preserve that victory and support the SDF while they continue raids on ISIS remnants and hold 10,000 ISIS detainees.\"\n\n\"The 2,000 US troops in Syria continue to blast and capture ISIS and Hurras al-Din leaders, as well as preventing Iranian-backed militants from having a land bridge to Lebanon and ultimately Israel,\" Caggins said; Hurras al-Din is an al-Qaeda-affiliated group in Syria.\n\nThese continued counter-terrorism efforts coincide with improving relations between Turkey and the SDF. A ceasefire recently ended months of skirmishes between the SDF and Turkey's Syrian militia allies.\n\n\"The situation now in eastern Syria is more fortuitous than it has been before for this type of US reduction of force,\" Heras said.\n\nThe SDF also signed a landmark deal with Damascus in March that will eventually see the SDF integrated into Syria's national armed forces. Until that deal, the US still has a crucial role to play in supporting its Kurdish-led partner.\n\n\"The new transitional Syrian government is not able to fund or staff the ISIS detention centers and Damascus tacitly welcomes the presence of US troops because they know that the well-trained, well-equipped SDF is a critical part of the future composition of the Syrian Ministry of Defense,\" Caggins said.\n\nThousands of ISIS fighters and their families remain in prisons and open-air camps in SDF-held areas. The most notable is the sprawling Al-Hol camp near the Iraqi border in northeast Syria. The camp is an indefinite detention for an estimated 40,000 people, primarily Iraqi and Syrian nationals, many with suspected links or sympathies to ISIS. ISIS prisoners and sleeper cells have attempted to free fellow captives and regroup, most notably in January 2022 through an attempted prison break in Hasaka that took the US-backed Kurdish authorities 10 days to suppress.\n\nEfforts to rehabilitate foreign ISIS fighters at al-Hol are ongoing. So far, an estimated half of Iraqi nationals in the camp have been repatriated, with the majority rehabilitated.\n\nShortly before he returned to the White House in January, Trump said that America should have nothing to do with Syria or its conflict.\n\nCentury International's Lund believes it remains to be seen if \"a more extensive pullout\" of US troops from Syria and Syria's reabsorption of SDF territories and institutions could be smoothly coordinated with Damascus and Ankara.\n\n\"If everyone shows a bit of goodwill, you could have a handover of areas and prisons and other things\" from the US and SDF to the Syrian government, Lund said. \"But if there's not a deal in place when US troops start a final exit, or if there's a deal that doesn't hold up when tested, things could go haywire very quickly.\"\n\n\"Even if we end up with just a partial reduction of forces this time, I believe the United States will probably quit Syria in Trump's second mandate,\" Lund added. \"And if so, it will probably be sooner rather than later.\"\n\nPaul Iddon is a freelance journalist and columnist who writes about Middle East developments, military affairs, politics, and history.

The bill authorizes the creation of a bipartisan commission to pave a path for several Illinois counties to join Indiana, pending the passage of similar legislation in Illinois and, ultimately, federal approval. But a corresponding bill in neighboring Illinois, House Bill 1500, remains stuck in committee, and there is ample reason to be skeptical about any change to state borders taking place. Yet, the issues raised by the proposed move speak to the difficult balance between promoting national unity and recognizing local distinctiveness.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe idea of counties leaving a state is not as eccentric as it may seem. In fact, it has happened several times in American history resulting in the states of Vermont, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Maine. And at various times, counties in Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri experienced cross-border movement. The idea may be gaining traction once again, as illustrated by the Indiana-Illinois proposal and the Greater Idaho movement, which hopes to see much of eastern Oregon join Idaho. Perhaps the best example of the local appeal—and national dangers—of the practice comes from Maine’s journey to statehood. This history highlights why local voters pursue such solutions, along with the unintended national consequences which can arise as a result of these goals being realized. While Maine’s statehood is often remembered only in the context of the Missouri Compromise, it was also the culmination of decades of growing political and cultural divides between Maine and Massachusetts.\n\nRead More: Now You Know: Why Are There Two Dakotas? Maine was originally part of Massachusetts. Following the American Revolution, many in Maine began to express resentment about how the state legislature in far-off Boston administered the District of Maine, likening their situation to that of the American colonies before the Revolution. They complained about the sale of massive tracts of land to speculators, driving up the cost of land for would-be settlers. They chaffed under taxes and regulations that were better suited to the economic realities of Massachusetts than Maine, where prices were already higher, foodstuffs and currency more scarce, and farmers more dependent on the seasonal export of timber than in the rest of the state. At the same time, Mainers emphasized their hardiness in coping with the harsher winters they endured and their distinct history. They celebrated and mourned the facts that Maine had been a separate colony from Massachusetts until the 1670s and the site of many of the most intense battles between English, French, and Indigenous forces during the early 1700s.\n\nPerhaps most frustrating to Mainers: the domineering influence of Boston in the state’s government. They also complained that the distance from any part of Maine to Boston made it an “inconvenience” to participate in the state’s legislature, or to access government records and services. Between the 1780s and the 1810s, there was only very slow progress toward Maine separating from Massachusetts. The Massachusetts legislature was not completely inattentive during this time, creating new district courts in Maine and allowing the counties in Maine to vote on the issue several times, with each successive occasion garnering a greater portion of the vote. Mainers, both in favor and in opposition to separation, were also active in rallying support during these years, publishing countless newspaper articles and pamphlets on the subject, as well as holding several separation conventions in Portland and Brunswick.\n\nPro-separation writers tended to emphasize the distinctiveness of Maine and the need for a smaller legislature, composed of men who understood the local environment and economic conditions, and who could effectively legislate on behalf of Mainers. They argued that if smaller states like Vermont and New Hampshire could govern themselves, so too could Maine. That was especially true because Massachusetts, they contended, had a history of vacillating between mismanaging and neglecting Maine, as seen in the War of 1812, when the state government did not send the militia to oust the British from occupied Castine and Eastport. Anti-separation arguments tended to focus on the stability that remaining a part of Massachusetts offered, the larger population and economic potential of the two together, and the hopes (at least before the War of 1812) that Massachusetts would be a powerful ally in the event of a British invasion from New Brunswick.\n\nMeanwhile, a small group of Mainers, especially in York County (west of Portland, and the location of the Portsmouth naval yard, in Kittery), favored joining New Hampshire, instead of becoming part of a new state. They had different aims from those wanting independence, but they shared the desire to be a part of a state that reflected their own political values and to which they were economically tied. In both 1816 and 1819, the start of the Massachusetts legislative session was met with a flurry of petitions from Maine towns requesting the opportunity to vote on separation. Signed by thousands, these petitions revealed the rising popularity of the idea. In these petitions, separatists provided numerous reasons why Maine should break off from Massachusetts. One, from the town of Hallowell, argued “the resources and extensive territory of Maine could be best called forth and improved by a local government.” They also claimed that education, so essential “to preserve the political virtue of our free and invaluable institutions,” could be better supported by a separate state of Maine.\n\nAn 1816 vote was mired in controversy, but finally, on July 26, 1819, Mainers conclusively voted to separate from Massachusetts, with 17,091 favoring and 7,132 opposing separation. In October, a constitutional convention was held in Portland and Maine’s provisional legislature petitioned Congress for statehood in January 1820. All indications suggested a rapid admission into the Union. Read More: America's Rural Hospital Crisis Has Been Looming for Decades But then a roadblock emerged: at the time, the U.S. had an equal number of free and slave states. Politicians from slave-holding states feared that rapid growth in the number of states that outlawed slavery would eventually lead to a national ban. As such, they threatened to block Maine’s statehood (just as anti-slavery Congressmen threatened to block statehood for Missouri). In an effort to maintain the status-quo, members on both sides agreed to the Missouri Compromise: Maine would enter the Union as a free state, while Missouri would enter as a slave state. Additionally, no new slave states would be created north of the 36°30′ line of latitude. While Mainers got what they wanted, the Missouri Compromise merely postponed the battle over slavery. Subsequent compromises delayed the battle further, but eventually such efforts failed to prevent the outbreak of the Civil War.\n\nWhen seen through this lens, Maine’s separation from Massachusetts speaks to both the spirit of community and of legislators listening to their constituents, which, at its best, makes American representative democracy work. Yet, the tie to the Missouri Compromise speaks to the dangers of geographic factionalism as well.\n\nThe Illinois residents who want to separate from Illinois share some of the complaints voiced by Mainers in the 19th century. They assert that Chicago dominates Illinois politics, and the state government does not represent them well. The Maine case illustrates that their desire to be governed by likeminded legislators and to live in a more homogenous political community is far from new.\n\nYet, the role of Maine’s separation in the sectional politics of the U.S. also offers a cautionary note. No one can argue that Maine’s statehood, or even the Missouri Compromise itself, was the singular or direct cause of the Civil War. It nonetheless hardened deepening partisan and geographic divisions in the U.S. The absorption of some of Illinois’ most strongly Republican counties into already solidly Republican Indiana, strengthening Democratic control of Illinois in the process, would similarly risk writing partisan and ideological divisions into state borders. If successful, Illinois residents leaving the Prairie State for another state, or forming a new one of their own, might feel like such a move gives them more of a voice in their own governance. Yet, the eventual outcome of the geographic tensions could deepen our already hardened partisan divides and reawaken the long-dormant precedent of writing political divisions into our maps. Redrawing the borders of Illinois, as Indiana legislators are proposing to do, might create fault lines that could one day prove rapturous.\n\nConor William Howard is a PhD candidate at Indiana University, Bloomington.

As our dirty turncoat strategy game columnist Sin Vega briefly explores in her review for Eurogamer, the game's Age structure, which hands you a new culture at intervals in each campaign, is reminiscent of Humankind's Era transitions.\n\nDevelopers Firaxis have elsewhere observed that the impression of Civ cribbing notes from Humankind is an unfortunate coincidence. According to an interview with executive producer Dennis Shirk last year, the Civ 7 team came up with the concept on their own, pitching it to parent company 2K Games mere days after Amplitude unveiled Humankind. It's also, of course, worth reiterating that as a historical 4X, Humankind takes plenty of cues from older Civilizations. Still, Amplitude co-founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis was tickled pink when he saw Humankind cited in Civ 7 reviews. \"That was probably the best compliment I ever got when I read some of these articles on Civ 7,\" he told me during an interview about Amplitude's forthcoming Endless Legend 2, adding \"I did not see that coming, to be frank.\"\n\nWhile they're obviously competitors, and have never done any kind of formal collaboration, de Waubert de Genlis says Amplitude and Firaxis largely get on and are enthused by each other's work. \"Sometimes we have conventions where we meet some programmers, some designers, we chat, and it's always cool, because it's always very good stuff,\" he told me, when I asked if the two teams had ever gotten together to bandy around features. \"But we could see from a while ago that already they were following [our work]. And it was very exciting for us, being much smaller at the time, and still is today. I mean, Firaxis was, in many ways, the reason for me to become a designer, originally. So when these people look at my games, it's very surprising.\"\n\nBeing compared to Civilization can be tricky, of course, in terms of managing the expectations of players and publishers. The 4X is fundamentally a \"niche\" genre, de Waubert de Genlis argued, and few specimens beside Civ are capable of shifting millions before launch. Amplitude's games tend to have a \"small bump\" at first, he said, gathering a healthy following over the coming months.\n\n\"Basically Civilization is like 16 or 17 million players on Civ 6, I think,\" he spelled out. \"Then most of our 4Xs are around 2 million-ish, Humankind is at 3.5 million. So it's big, but still far away from the 17 million. And then if you look at the other 4Xs that are not Amplitude or not Civ, the best ones would be... I'd say it depends if you take Paradox as [the same kind of] 4X or not, because they're real time. If you take turn-based 4X, very quickly you go down to the very small numbers. So it is difficult.\"\n\nNonetheless, de Waubert de Genlis says Amplitude have never felt any pressure to out-perform Civilization - even from Humankind publisher Sega, their parent company until November last year. \"Sega were not really telling us, you know, we had to be Civilization because, you know, it's a 25 year franchise, or more, maybe 30 year franchise,\" he said. \"And you can't overnight become Civilization.\"\n\nWhether they originate from Civ or a smaller, feisty Civlike, I'm keen to see more Age or Era-style mechanics in strategy games. Back in 2021, Nate Crowley (RPS in peace) called jumping Eras \"possibly Humankind's greatest strength\", allowing the player to switch rails and transform, say, a culture greased by gold into one fuelled by research. \"This on-the-fly redefinition of your entire gameplan, and the fact that it's a necessity rather than an option, is a masterstroke,\" he wrote. \"The more I play, the more fundamentally brilliant a mechanic I realise it is, and on this front at least, I don't feel like a dick in saying Humankind blows Civ out of the water.\"\n\nI'm not sure Civ 7 players are as keen about the implementation of Ages. Here is another chunk from traitorous opportunist Sin's Eurogamer review: \"The first two ages close with escalating crises that force you to choose negative modifiers (evil doppelgangers of social policies, which are unlocked with culture instead of science) until the act break. It's a move towards narrative - an unpredictable challenge to make the game - and you - less rote. In practice, they're either irrelevant or deeply irritating.\"\n\nThe broad thinking behind Eras and Ages is to keep breaking players out of their ruts over the course of a mammoth campaign. I think that's a noble aim, even if the execution is muddled. Endless Legend 2 is trying something similar with the tidefall mechanic, which peels back the ocean at intervals to reveal new navigable areas. You can read more about that in my Endless Legend 2 hands-on."}

Now modification company ColorWare has a solution to that problem, but it’s going to cost you.\n\nThanks to ColorWare’s clever customization, you can get an Apple Pencil Pro in one of seven Crayola crayon-inspired colors: black, mint (green), pink, purple, red, yellow, and white. In addition to the colors, the Pencils look exactly like Crayola crayons with a matte-painted wrapper adorned with the trademark black oval. In a nod to its inspiration, ColorWare cheekily warns, “Do not sharpen.”\n\nHowever, the unique paint job will cost you. Specifically, it’ll cost you $86 more than the Apple Pencil Pro MSRP. ColorWare charges $215 for one of the new Crayon Pencils, which is something of a bargain over the non-Pro Number 2 Pencil, which also sells for $215 but is a mod of the cheaper 2nd-gen Pencil. The $215 MSRP doesn’t include shipping, which varies by location.\n\nColorWare also sells a variety of modified Apple products, including a Mac mini Retro in Light and Dark, starting at $899, a premium of $300 over the standard Mac mini. It’s worth noting that the customization voids the standard Apple warranty, though ColorWare offers its own 1-year parts and labor warranty.\n\nIf you’re interested, the Apple Crayon Pros are expected to ship at the end of April."}

It’s home to more than one thousand relics of failed business ventures—like the Heinz Tomato Ketchup Cookbook, Bic’s pencil just for women, and a stock certificate from Lehman Brothers. While these flops and washouts might be fun to laugh at, they hold powerful lessons for business leaders.\n\nIn this episode, museum founder and venture capitalist Sean Jacobsohn identifies six forces of failure—from bad timing to poor financial management—with the help of artifacts from his cautionary collection. Along the way, you’ll learn how your company can avoid making the same costly mistakes.\n\nBy the way, if you want to see the items Jacobsohn talks about, go to HBR’s YouTube channel, where you’ll find the video version of this episode.\n\nHere’s Jacobsohn.\n\nSEAN JACOBSOHN: I have a lot of favorites. The Pets.com sock puppet from 1998, they could have been successful if they didn’t build a money-losing business. Harley Davidson Cologne from 1996, it reeked the scent of tobacco. Here’s an unopened bottle. No, they weren’t joking. They were serious about it. They did a lot of product extensions, of course. Sparkling water, Cheetos lip balm.\n\nAnother one of my favorites is Allan from 1964. He was Ken’s best friend. You may remember him from the Barbie movie.\n\nALLAN: Hi Barbie!\n\nBARBIE: Oh, hi Allan.\n\nSEAN JACOBSOHN: Here he is in the original box. Allan wore the same clothing. He was his best friend. The problem is everyone just wanted to own Ken, not Allan. Yes, I have two cans of New Coke. You want me to bring them out? It was really hard to switch people in mass to something completely different. I have not tasted one. I certainly have been tempted, but some of these things are 15, 20, 30 years old, so they probably don’t taste good anymore.\n\nI’m Sean Jacobsohn, partner at Norwest Venture Partners. I’m on 14 boards. I’m also the founder and curator of the Failure Museum. The Failure Museum has over 1,000 items and continues to grow. Failed companies, failed products, failed sports-related items, and failed toys. I’ve tagged all 1,000 items of mine to one or two forces of failure.\n\nProduct market fit, team, financial management, timing, competition, and customer success. I’m going to go through all six forces of failure and share one example of each. I have a champagne bottle from Webvan’s IPO date in 1999. For product market fit, Webvan is a good example. They were the world’s first grocery delivery company.\n\nSPEAKER 4: You have the right to come home from work and find something good waiting for you in the fridge.\n\nSEAN JACOBSOHN: They raised over $880 million to launch in 10 cities before having proven one. Business model required so much capital. They had distribution centers. They hired their own drivers, which is why they had to raise $880 million. Not enough demand for the early version of your product. You shouldn’t yet scale go to market.\n\nSo I have a Theranos mug, and I also have Elizabeth Holmes’ business card. Their goal was to revolutionize the blood-testing industry, and at the peak were worth $10 billion. Theranos didn’t have a strong team or board. None of them had domain expertise. They tried to use a pinprick of blood to do testing, and that’s just not enough data. Yeah, when they don’t have domain expertise, hiring other people without domain expertise, you believe in something can be possible when it really isn’t.\n\nHere is a copy of the Google Glass, and I can put it on here too. A good example of customer success is Google Glass. They did not pick the right early customers well. They started with doctors, and doctors could see patient records on the Glass while they were talking to the patient. So they didn’t have to use their computer. It felt invasive.\n\nIt didn’t seem very personal, and you’re not used to having someone with a strange device on your face trying to communicate with you. Because it lacked the cool factor, they couldn’t find any other segments of the population that wanted to wear something like this. It’s important to pick the right early customers that are representative of your bigger market. A lot of times people pick the most convenient customers rather than those that are going to help you build a big business. I love this one so much that I actually bought two of them on eBay.\n\nFor financial management, the ESPN mobile phone. They launched a year before the iPhone. All the phone did was calling, sharing ESPN mobile content and scores. They burned through $150 million, including several Superbowl ads. It only hit 6% of a sales target. They probably should have had more capabilities on the phone. There just wasn’t enough to do on the phone.\n\nSPEAKER 5: Introducing Mobile ESPN. Sports fans, your phone has arrived.\n\nSEAN JACOBSOHN: I have a couple items here, a WeWork Thermos and a koozie from WeWorks summer camp. For timing, a good example is WeWork. WeWorks in the coworking space business. And when the pandemic hit, the demand for office space fell off a cliff and they ended up burning through $16 billion. The goal was to give people flexible space that allowed you to do month-to-month leases and scale up and down in space depending on your demand.\n\nThey also signed 10 to 15 year leases at peak market prices, and then they ended up renting them out at a loss. There’s some level of unluckiness, but I think that they had the wrong business model. You need to have a pulse on what’s happening in the market and be able to anticipate what’s going to happen in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\nAnd so I’ve had several friends donate their Blockbuster membership card to me. And then in every store there was a sign that said, “Be kind, rewind.” For competition, Blockbuster’s a good example. They’re in the movie rental business. At the peak, they had 9,000 stores. They missed the opportunity to move online and Netflix ate their lunch. They also, after they went public, had the opportunity to buy Netflix for $50 million and turned it down and instead Netflix ended up beating them.\n\nWhen I talk about competition, you need to make sure that you don’t have an upstart competitor that offers a cheaper, better way of doing what you do. You need to be aware of all the competitors in your market segment and how you stay differentiated and better than them.\n\nI do admire companies for taking risks and trying new things. Some of these big risks turn into humongous outcomes and some fail spectacularly. I’m a lot of times surprised at the lack of research that they did before they spent a lot of money to roll something out that wasn’t going to work.\n\nHANNAH BATES: That was Sean Jacobsohn, partner at Norwest Venture Partners and founder of the Failure Museum.\n\nWe’ll be back next Wednesday with another hand-picked conversation about business strategy from the Harvard Business Review.

But seeing as the last one dates back to September of last year, I’m well off that mark and figured it’s high time to put pen to paper. The fact is that a lot is happening around here at CSS-Tricks — and it’s all good stuff.\n\nThe Almanac is rolling\n\nIn the last post of 2024, I said that filling the Almanac was a top priority heading into this year. We had recently refreshed the whole dang thing, complete with completely new sections for documenting CSS selectors, at-rules, and functions on top of the sections we already had for properties and pseudo-selectors. The only problem is that those new sections were pretty bare.\n\nWell, not only has this team stepped up to produce a bunch of new content for those new sections, but so have you. Together, we’ve published 21 new Almanac entries since the start of 2025. Here they are in all their glory:\n\nWhat’s even better? There are currently fourteen more in the hopper that we’re actively working on. I certainly do not expect us to sustain this sort of pace all year. A lot of work goes into each and every entry. Plus, if all we ever did was write in Almanac, we would never get new articles and tutorials out to you, which is really what we’re all about around here.\n\nA lot of podcasts and events\n\nThose of you who know me know that I’m not the most social person in all the land. Yes, I like hanging out with folks and all that, but I tend to keep my activities to back-of-the-house stuff and prefer to stay out of view.\n\nSo, that’s why it’s weird for me to call out a few recent podcast and event appearances. It’s not like I do these things all that often, but they are fun and I like to note them, even if its only for posterity.\n\nI hosted Smashing Meets Accessibility, a mini online conference that featured three amazing speakers talking about the ins and outs of WCAG conformance, best practices, and incredible personal experiences shaped by disability.\n\nI hosted Smashing Meets CSS, another mini conference from the wonderful Smashing Magazine team. I got to hang out with Adam Argyle, Julia Micene, and Miriam Suzanne, all of whom blew my socks off with their presentations and panel discussion on what’s new and possible in modern CSS.\n\nI’m co-hosting a brand-new podcast with Brad Frost called Open Up! We recorded the first episode live in front of an audience that was allowed to speak up and participate in the conversation. The whole idea of the show is that we talk more about the things we tend to talk less about in our work as web designers and developers — the touchy-feely side of what we do. We covered so many heady topics, from desperation during layoffs to rediscovering purpose in your work.\n\nI was a guest on the Mental Health in Tech podcast, joining a panel of other front-enders to discuss angst in the face of recent technological developments. The speed and constant drive to market new technologies is dizzying and, to me at least, off-putting to the extent that I’ve questioned my entire place in it as a developer. What a blast getting to return to the podcast a second time and talk shop with a bunch of the most thoughtful, insightful people you’ll ever hear. I’ll share that when it’s published.\n\nA new guide on styling counters\n\nWe published it just the other week! I’ll be honest and say that a complete guide about styling counters in CSS was not the first thing that came to my mind when we started planning new ideas, but I’ll be darned if Juan didn’t demonstrate just how big a topic it is. There are so many considerations when it comes to styling counters — design! accessibility! semantics! — and the number of tools we have in CSS to style them is mind-boggling, including two functions that look very similar but have vastly different capabilities for creating custom counters — counter() and counters() (which are also freshly published in the Almanac).\n\nAt the end of last year, I said I hoped to publish 1-2 new guides, and here we are in the first quarter of 2025 with our first one out in the wild! That gives me hope that we’ll be able to get another comprehensive guide out before the end of the year.\n\nAuthors\n\nI think the most exciting update of all is getting to recognize the folks who have published new articles with us since the last update. Please help me extend a huge round of applause to all the faces who have rolled up their sleeves and shared their knowledge with us.\n\nAnd, of course, nothing on this site would be possible without ongoing help from Juan Diego Rodriguez and Ryan Trimble. Those two not only do a lot of heavy lifting to keep the content machine fed, but they are also just two wonderful people who make my job a lot more fun and enjoyable. Seriously, guys, you mean a lot to this site and me!"}

Instead, it emphasizes a single source of truth paradigm as a data foundation of observability. This approach prioritizes high-cardinality, wide-event datasets over traditional siloed telemetry, aiming to address modern system complexity more effectively.\n\nWhat is Observability 2.0 and Wide Events ​\n\nFor years, observability has relied on the three pillars of metrics, logs, and traces. These pillars spawned countless libraries, tools, and standards—including OpenTelemetry, one of the most successful cloud-native projects, which is built entirely on this paradigm. However, as systems grow in complexity, the limitations of this approach become evident.\n\nThe Downsides of Traditional Observability ​\n\nData silos : Metrics, logs, and traces are often stored separately, leading to uncorrelated, or even inconsistent, data without meticulous management.\n\n: Metrics, logs, and traces are often stored separately, leading to uncorrelated, or even inconsistent, data without meticulous management. Pre-aggregation trade-offs : Pre-aggregated metrics (counters, summaries, histograms) were originally designed to reduce storage costs and improve performance by sacrificing granularity. However, the rigid structure of time-series data limits the depth of contextual information, forcing teams to generate millions of distinct time-series to capture necessary details. Ironically, this practice now incurs exponentially higher storage and computational costs—directly contradicting the approach’s original purpose.\n\n: Pre-aggregated metrics (counters, summaries, histograms) were originally designed to reduce storage costs and improve performance by sacrificing granularity.

Adapting observability requires code changes, forcing it to align with slow software development cycles. Redundant data: Identical information is duplicated across metrics, logs, and traces, wasting storage and increasing overhead.\n\nWide Events: The Approach of Observability 2.0 ​\n\nObservability 2.0 addresses these issues by adopting wide events as its foundational data structure. Instead of precomputing metrics or structuring logs upfront, it preserves raw, high-fidelity event data as the single source of truth. This allows teams to perform exploratory analysis retroactively, deriving metrics, logs, and traces dynamically from the original dataset.\n\nBoris Tane, in his article Observability Wide Event 101, defines a wide event as a context-rich, high-dimensional, and high-cardinality record. For example, a single wide event might include:\n\njson { \" method \" : \" POST \" , \" path \" : \" /articles \" , \" service \" : \" articles \" , \" outcome \" : \" ok \" , \" status_code \" : 201 , \" duration \" : 268 , \" requestId \" : \" 8bfdf7ecdd485694 \" , \" timestamp \" : \" 2024-09-08 06:14:05.680 \" , \" message \" : \" Article created \" , \" commit_hash \" : \" 690de31f245eb4f2160643e0dbb5304179a1cdd3 \" , \" user \" : { \" id \" : \" fdc4ddd4-8b30-4ee9-83aa-abd2e59e9603 \" , \" activated \" : true, \" subscription \" : { \" id \" : \" 1aeb233c-1572-4f54-bd10-837c7d34b2d3 \" , \" trial \" : true, \" plan \" : \" free \" , \" expiration \" : \" 2024-09-16 14:16:37.980 \" , \" created \" : \" 2024-08-16 14:16:37.980 \" , \" updated \" : \" 2024-08-16 14:16:37.980 \" }, \" created \" : \" 2024-08-16 14:16:37.980 \" , \" updated \" : \" 2024-08-16 14:16:37.980 \" }, \" article \" : { \" id \" : \" f8d4d21c-f1fd-48b9-a4ce-285c263170cc \" , \" title \" : \" Test Blog Post \" , \" ownerId \" : \" fdc4ddd4-8b30-4ee9-83aa-abd2e59e9603 \" , \" published \" : false, \" created \" : \" 2024-09-08 06:14:05.460 \" , \" updated \" : \" 2024-09-08 06:14:05.460 \" }, \" db \" : { \" query \" : \" INSERT INTO articles (id, title, content, owner_id, published, created, updated) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7); \" , \" parameters \" : { \" $1 \" : \" f8d4d21c-f1fd-48b9-a4ce-285c263170cc \" , \" $2 \" : \" Test Blog Post \" , \" $3 \" : \" ****** \" , \" $4 \" : \" fdc4ddd4-8b30-4ee9-83aa-abd2e59e9603 \" , \" $5 \" : false, \" $6 \" : \" 2024-09-08 06:14:05.460 \" , \" $7 \" : \" 2024-09-08 06:14:05.460 \" } }, \" cache \" : { \" operation \" : \" write \" , \" key \" : \" f8d4d21c-f1fd-48b9-a4ce-285c263170cc \" , \" value \" : \" { \\\" article \\\" :{ \\\" id \\\" : \\\" f8d4d21c-f1fd-48b9-a4ce-285c263170cc \\\" , \\\" title \\\" : \\\" Test Blog Post \\\" ... \" }, \" headers \" : { \" accept-encoding \" : \" gzip, br \" , \" cf-connecting-ip \" : \" ***** \" , \" connection \" : \" Keep-Alive \" , \" content-length \" : \" 1963 \" , \" content-type \" : \" application/json \" , \" host \" : \" website.com \" , \" url \" : \" https://website.com/articles \" , \" user-agent \" : \" Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 \" , \" Authorization \" : \" ******** \" , \" x-forwarded-proto \" : \" https \" , \" x-real-ip \" : \" ****** \" } }\n\nWide events contain significantly more contextual data than traditional structured logs, capturing comprehensive application state details. When stored in an observability data store, these events serve as a raw dataset from which teams can compute any conventional metric post hoc. For instance:\n\nQPS (queries per second) for a specific API path.\n\nResponse rate distributions by HTTP status code.\n\nError rates filtered by user region or device type.\n\nThis process requires no code changes—metric are derived directly from the raw event data through queries, eliminating the need for pre-aggregation or prior instrumentation.\n\nFor practical implementations, see:\n\nChallenges of Observability 2.0 Adoption ​\n\nTraditional metrics and logs were designed to prioritize resource efficiency: minimizing compute and storage costs. For example, Prometheus employs a semi-key-value data model to optimize time-series storage, akin to the early NoSQL era: just as developers moved relational database workloads to Redis (counters, sorted sets, lists) for speed and simplicity, observability tools adopted pre-aggregated metrics and logs to reduce overhead.\n\nHowever, like the shift to Big Data in software engineering, the move from the \"three pillars\" to wide events reflects a growing need for raw, granular data over precomputed summaries. This transition introduces key challenges:\n\nEvent generation : Lack of mature frameworks to instrument applications and emit standardized, context-rich wide events.\n\n: Lack of mature frameworks to instrument applications and emit standardized, context-rich wide events.

Tooling integration: Leveraging existing tools (e.g., dashboards, alerts) by deriving metrics and logs retroactively from stored events, not at the application layer.\n\nWhat shapes the database for observability 2.0 ​\n\nAs Charity Majors notes in her recent blog post, observability is evolving toward a data lake model. While wide events simplify data modeling by acting as a single source of truth, they demand infrastructure designed to address the challenges outlined earlier.\n\nAdopting Observability 2.0 aims to maximize raw data utility without prohibitive complexity. While technically possible to cobble together a solution using:\n\nOLAP databases for raw event storage.\n\nPre-processing pipelines for derived metrics/traces.\n\nSeparate metric stores for dashboards.\n\nTrace stores for distributed tracing APIs.\n\nBackup systems for cold data. …this fragmented approach undermines the core promise of Observability 2.0. Instead, the paradigm demands a dedicated database optimized for its unique workload.\n\n（Figure 1: The Architecture of Observability 2.0）\n\nLet’s walk through key factors that define the database requirements for Observability 2.0:\n\nMaking good usage of commodity storage and data format ​\n\nDisaggregated architecture, cloud object storage\n\nColumnar data format for compression and performance\n\nAs demonstrated in Boris Tane’s example, a single uncompressed wide event can exceed 2KB in size. For high-throughput microservice-based applications, this introduces a multiplier effect on storage demands—especially when retaining data long-term for continuous analysis (e.g., training AI models or auditing historical trends).\n\nThe database must leverage cloud-based object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for cost efficiency and scalability. Ideally, it should automate data tiering between local and cloud storage with minimal management overhead—embodying the disaggregated compute and storage architecture, where storage scales independently of compute resources.\n\nColumnar data formats (e.g., Apache Parquet, Arrow) are critical for reducing storage costs. By storing values from the same field sequentially, they enable custom encoding (e.g., dictionary encoding, run-length encoding) to compress data at rest. Additionally, columnar formats are inherently optimized for analytical queries, as they allow efficient column pruning and vectorized processing.\n\nRealtime, scalable and elastic ​\n\nLow latency on query as well as data visibility\n\nThe ingestion rate can scale with site traffic\n\nDue to their pre-aggregated nature, traditional metrics don't scale as your traffic increases unless you spin up numerous new instances. This makes capacity planning for metrics stores more straightforward. However, with wide events serving as a single source of truth, observability data is generated per-request, meaning your observability 2.0 infrastructure must be as scalable and elastic as your application. To scale properly in modern cloud environments, databases must be designed carefully, keeping state contained within minimal scope and establishing clear separation of responsibilities for each type of node.\n\nYour data has to be ingested and query-able in realtime to fulfill the needs for realtime use-cases like dashboards and alerting.\n\nFlexible query capabilities ​\n\nThe database has to handle Observability 1.0 queries, as well as analytical queries.\n\nMetrics need to be derived from wide events, within the database.\n\nAn Observability 2.0 database must support two types of queries: routine queries (for dashboards and alerts) and exploratory queries (for ad-hoc analysis).\n\nRemoving metrics as first-class citizens does not eliminate the need for pre-aggregation: it simply shifts this responsibility from the application layer to the database. Users still require fast access to known-knowns (e.g., error rates, latency thresholds) via dashboards or alerts, which demands efficient processing of routine queries. However, this becomes challenging with high-dimensional data. To address this, the database must support:\n\nFlexible indexing strategies\n\nPre-processing capabilities\n\nIncremental computation (e.g., updating aggregates without reprocessing entire datasets)\n\nAdditionally, the database must handle exploratory analytics, which enables uncovering \"unknown unknowns\" through offline, long-term analysis. These queries are often unpredictable, spanning large datasets and extended time ranges. Ideally, the database should execute them without degrading performance for routine queries or ingestion. While users could offload this workload to a dedicated OLAP database, the added latency and cost of data duplication create friction, undermining Observability 2.0’s goal of unified, real-time insights.\n\nBackward-compatible to observability 1.0 ​\n\nWe still need Grafana dashboards\n\nWe already have robust dashboards, visualizations, and alert rules from Observability 1.0. Transitioning to wide events does not require abandoning these tools or rebuilding from scratch.\n\nA DSL like PromQL remains well-suited for time-series dashboards compared to SQL. The advantage now is that complex PromQL queries become unnecessary, thanks to the clear separation between routine queries (optimized for dashboards/alerts) and exploratory analytics. Crucially, high cardinality should no longer be a systemic limitation of the observability database.\n\nTrace views and log tailing functionality must remain accessible through the new backend. All established best practices from Observability 1.0—such as alert thresholds, dashboard conventions, and trace analysis workflows—should be preserved and enhanced, not discarded.\n\nThat's how we built GreptimeDB ​\n\nGreptimeDB is the open-source analytical observability database built for wide events and o11y 2.0 practice. We designed it to work seamlessly with modern cloud infrastructure, and provide our user efficient, one-stop and handy experience on observability data management.\n\n（Figure 2: Observability 2.0-The Greptime Way）\n\nThis logical flow chart describes key features of GreptimeDB that fits observability 2.0 data lifecycle:\n\nAccept incoming data in OpenTelemetry format\n\nBuilt-in transform engine to pre-process data\n\nHigh-throughput realtime data ingestion\n\nRealtime query API\n\nMaterialized view for data derivation\n\nRead-replicas for isolated analytical queries\n\nBuilt-in rule engine and trigger mechanisms for push-based notification\n\nObject storage for data persistence\n\nWe believe raw data based approach will transform how we use observability data and extract value from it. GreptimeDB is committed to be the open source infrastructure that helps you to archive it progressively.\n\nStart your journey with GreptimeDB today and unlock the future of observability, one event at a time.\n\nAbout Greptime ​\n\nGreptimeDB is an open-source, cloud-native database purpose-built for real-time observability.

But something's missing and scientists are confused", "fullContent": "Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is the only body beyond Earth known to host stable bodies of liquid on its surface.\n\nScientists have known for a while that Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has rivers and seas of liquid methane on its surface. But it's strangely lacking in deltas, a new study suggests.\n\nOn Earth, large rivers create deltas with sediment-filled wetlands. Deltas form when the mouth of a river empties into another body of water. Besides Earth, Titan is the only planetary body in our solar system with liquid flowing on the surface.\n\nResearchers recently looked for deltas on the big Saturn satellite but came up empty.\n\n\"We take it for granted that if you have rivers and sediments, you get deltas,\" study leader Sam Birch, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown University in Rhode Island, said in a statement .\n\n\"But Titan is weird. It's a playground for studying processes we thought we understood,\" he added.\n\nRelated: Space photo of the week: Look into Titan's 'eye,' 20 years after the Huygens spacecraft's historic landing on Saturn's largest moon\n\nThe researchers were hoping to find deltas on Titan, because these landforms feature lots of sediment. The sediment in deltas tends to come from a large area, and deltas gather it in one place. Studying such sediment could reveal insights about Titan's climate and tectonic histories — and perhaps even possible signs of alien life.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Cassini used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to look through Titan's thick atmosphere during these close encounters and found channels and large flat areas that are consistent with large bodies of liquid.\n\nBut shallow liquid methane is largely transparent in Cassini's SAR data. Scientists have therefore had a hard time studying Titan's coastal features, because it's hard to make out where the coast ends and the sea floor starts.\n\nSo, Birch's team came up with a computer model that simulates what Cassini's SAR would see when looking at Earth . But the model replaced the water in Earth's rivers and oceans with Titan's liquid methane.\n\n\"We basically made synthetic SAR images of Earth that assume properties of Titan's liquid instead of Earth's,\" Birch said. \"Once we see SAR images of a landscape we know very well, we can go back to Titan and understand a bit better what we're looking at.\"\n\nEarth as seen by the radar instrument on NASA's Cassini Saturn probe. In order to understand what landforms on Titan could be seen by Cassini's radar, researchers looked at well-known Earth landforms through Cassini's perspective. The bottom image is how the U.S. Gulf Coast would have looked to Cassini. (Image credit: Birch Lab/Brown University)\n\nThe synthetic SAR images of Earth that they created \"resolved large deltas and many other large coastal landscapes,\" according to the researchers.\n\nThey say that new analysis of the Cassini SAR data also revealed other mysteries. For example, Titan's coasts appear to have pits of unknown origin deep within lakes and seas, and deep channels cut across the moon's sea floors offer no clue to how they got there.\n\n\"This is really not what we expected,\" Birch said. \"But Titan does this to us a lot. I think that's what makes it such an engaging place to study.\"\n\nThe new study was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets on March 25."}

Mass production is expected for the second half of the year, and TSMC promises it will represent a major step forward in performance and efficiency — potentially reshaping the technological landscape.\n\nMicrochips are the foundation of modern technology, found in nearly all electronic devices, from electric toothbrushes and smartphones to laptops and household appliances. They are made by layering and etching materials like silicon to create microscopic circuits containing billions of transistors .\n\nThese transistors are effectively tiny switches, managing the flow of electricity and allowing computers to work. In general, the more transistors a chip contains, the faster and more powerful it becomes.\n\nThe microchip industry consistently endeavors to pack more transistors into a smaller area, leading to faster, more powerful, and energy efficient technological devices.\n\nCompared to the previous most advanced chip, known as 3nm chips, TSMC's 2nm technology should deliver notable benefits. These include a 10%-15% boost in computing speed at the same power level or a 20-30% reduction in power usage at the same speed.\n\nAdditionally, transistor density in 2nm chips is increased by about 15%, over and above the 3nm technology. This should enable devices to operate faster, consume less energy, and manage more complex tasks efficiently.\n\nTaiwan's microchip industry is closely tied into its security.

However, there is uncertainty over whether the 2nm chips can be manufactured outside Taiwan , as some officials are concerned that could undermine the island's security.\n\nEstablished in 1987, TSMC, which stands for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, manufactures chips for other companies. Taiwan accounts for 60% of the global \"foundry\" market (the outsourcing of semiconductor manufacturing) and the vast majority of that comes from TSMC alone .\n\nTSMC's super-advanced microchips are used by other companies in a wide range of devices. It manufactures Apple's A-series processors used in iPhones, iPads, and Macs, it produces NVidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) used for machine learning and AI applications. It also makes AMD's Ryzen and EPYC processors used by supercomputers worldwide, and it produces Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors, used by Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus, and Google phones.\n\nIn 2020, TSMC started a special microchip miniaturization process, called 5nm FinFET technology , that played a crucial role in smartphone and high-performance computing (HPC) development. HPC is the practice of getting multiple processors to work simultaneously on complex computing problems.\n\nTwo years later, TSMC launched a 3nm miniaturization process based on even smaller microchips. This further enhanced performance and power efficiency. Apple's A-series processor, for example, is based on this technology.\n\nSmartphones, laptops and tablets with 2nm chips could benefit from better performance and longer battery life. This will lead to smaller, lighter devices without sacrificing power.\n\nThe efficiency and speed of 2nm chips has the potential to enhance AI-based applications such as voice assistants, real time language translation, and autonomous computer systems (those designed to work with minimal to no human input). Data centers could experience reduced energy consumption and improved processing capabilities, contributing to environmental sustainability goals.\n\nSectors like autonomous vehicles and robotics could benefit from the increased processing speed and reliability of the new chips, making these technologies safer and more practical for widespread adoption.\n\nThis all sounds really promising, but while 2nm chips represent a technological milestone, they also pose challenges. The first one is related to the manufacturing complexity.\n\nProducing 2nm chips requires cutting-edge techniques like extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography . This complex and expensive process increases production costs and demands extremely high precision.\n\nAnother big issue is heat. Even with relatively lower consumption, as transistors shrink and densities increase, managing heat dissipation becomes a critical challenge.\n\nOverheating can impact chip performance and durability. In addition, at such a small scale, traditional materials like silicon may reach their performance limits, requiring the exploration of different materials.\n\nThat said, the enhanced computational power, energy efficiency, and miniaturization enabled by these chips could be a gateway to a new era of consumer and industrial computing. Smaller chips could lead to breakthroughs in tomorrow's technology, creating devices that are not only powerful but also discreet and more environmentally friendly."}

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. In this article, we decided to focus on Occidental Petroleum's ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:\n\n8.4% = US$2.9b ÷ US$34b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.\n\nView our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 8.4% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, Occidental Petroleum's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 14% either. Despite this, surprisingly, Occidental Petroleum saw an exceptional 49% net income growth over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nWe then compared Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 38% in the same 5-year period."}

This period witnessed several key developments, including the retirement of Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey from the Board of Directors and a key CEO appointment. Despite reporting significant financial losses for 2024, new product launches such as the Xeon 6 processors provided positive momentum. The share price performance came amidst a challenging market environment, with the Nasdaq declining 6% largely due to a tech sell-off. Intel's moves during this time contrasted broader trends, with company-specific changes potentially bolstering investor sentiment.\n\nWe've discovered 1 warning sign for Intel that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nNasdaqGS:INTC Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Apr 2025\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 22 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nThe recent changes at Intel, such as the board reshuffle and CEO appointment, coupled with product launches like the Xeon 6 processors, have injected optimism, possibly boosting investor sentiment. Over the last year, however, the total shareholder return, including share price and dividends, declined 41.52%, contrasting with the 8.56% return of the US Semiconductor industry. These developments highlight Intel's challenges in a competitive landscape marked by new market entrants, especially in the AI PC category, which could affect its revenue and margin growth.\n\nIntel's long-term share performance has been underwhelming compared to the broader market. The share price change relative to its consensus price target of US$22.90 reflects some market skepticism, with Intel trading a slight discount of around 6%. Despite promising prospects, such as AI-driven innovations that may bolster revenue, analysts remain cautious about short-term revenue and earnings forecasts. Current market conditions, compounded by industry pressures, emphasize the importance of Intel delivering on new product timelines to improve financial health and market positioning.\n\nReview our historical performance report to gain insights into Intel's track record.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Over the years, it's been rumored that Apple's struggle to release a folding phone is due to the crease in the screen. Gurman says that next year's phone will feature a \"nearly invisible\" crease when the iPhone is in the open position.\n\nOn the other side of the device, it should have a \"much higher-quality hinge.\" Earlier this year, tipster Instant Digital wrote that Apple will offer a revolutionary liquid metal hinge that utilizes \"amorphous alloy (metallic glass).\" Allegedly, this alloy will be more durable and able to get flatter.\n\nIn comparison, Samsung's flagship foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold series, has improved yearly but hasn't hidden the crease.\n\nStill, this year's Galaxy Z Fold 7 should be a significant upgrade compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Reportedly, Samsung Display has managed to eliminate the crease, but it's unclear if that will appear in this year's model or next year's foldables.\n\nAnother high-end iPhone\n\nAccording to Gurman, the foldable iPhone will be pitched as a \"new high-end model, rather than a niche alternative design.\" This aligns with reports from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that it could release next year or in 2027 with a price between $2,000 and $2,500.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

He claimed the handset will be 4.5mm when unfolded and between 9mm and 9.5mm when folded. Very similar to specs to what the Z Fold 7 should feature this year.\n\nGurman did add a caveat that sources he spoke with said that development could fall behind, which suggests that we might not see the phone until 2027.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide"}

Unfortunately, it's not as simple as going to your favorite retailer and adding one to your cart. The demand for the console has vastly exceeded the supply.\n\nNintendo will offer some pre-orders directly, but there are some requirements you must meet — and even then, you'll only have a chance to get one based on luck.\n\nInvites have started going out today, May 8, for those who have registered interest and meet all of Nintendo's requirements (don't worry, they're not too extreme). Additional invites could be sent out over the day (and days that follow), but it seems the first group has already received their invites.\n\nHow to get a chance to pre-order a Switch 2 through Nintendo\n\nIf you're looking to get a Switch 2 from Nintendo, you'll first need to head to the company's How to buy Nintendo Switch 2 page. The top of the page has links to some of the most popular U.S. retailers, but your chances of getting one from any of them are slim.\n\nTowards the bottom of the page, you can register your interest in pre-ordering a console. You must log in with your Nintendo account and select whether you want to pre-order the Mario Kart bundle or just the console (you can't change your mind once you've locked in).\n\nAs shared by The Shortcut, there are four key requirements you must meet if you want to be chosen for a console:\n\nMust have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership\n\nMust have a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours as of April 2, 2025\n\nMust be at least 18 years of age\n\nMust have opted in to share gameplay data with Nintendo\n\nMost of those shouldn't be too restrictive to dedicated Nintendo fans, but having a paid Nintendo Online membership might bump out quite a few people. It doesn't specify 12 months of continuous membership, so it seems that as long as you've had 12 months of on-and-off time, you should be able to register.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

If you don't jump in during that period, Nintendo will move on to other people who've expressed interest."}

While Instagram does not grant permission for companies to embed these images, a 2007 Ninth Circuit ruling known as the “server test” established that when an image remains on a third party’s server and is not stored on the infringer’s computer, embedding it does not count as a new display. In other words, embedding the original display of the image in a new context does not constitute copyright infringement.\n\nDigital Camera World reports that McGucken’s petition asks the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of the server test and consider whether a website’s unauthorized display of an image violates copyright, no matter what technology is used to show the work.\n\nThe district courts and Ninth Circuit court both dismissed McGucken’s complaints. But the photographer is now turning to the Supreme Court to consider if displaying an image using embedding tools infringes copyright laws. The court will respond by May 1.\n\nThis is not the first time a photographer has attempted to challenge the server test. In 2023, Instagram beat a class of photographers in a lawsuit that claimed the Meta-owned platform contributes to copyright infringement by letting outside websites embed images.\n\nPhotographers Alexis Hunley and Matthew Brauer filed a class action lawsuit against Instagram after Buzzfeed and Time embedded their images without consent. Hunley and Brauer claimed that Instagram abused their copyright by allowing news outlets like Time and Buzzfeed to embed the photos that they shared to their profiles.\n\nHowever, a three-judge panel at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Instagram was not liable for copyright infringement because when a photo or video is embedded, no copy is made of the underlying content.\n\nImage credits: Header photo licensed via Depositphotos."}

On Earth, these chemicals are made only by certain microbes and algae, although, in theory, non-biological processes could make them, too.\n\nThis isn't the first time JWST has studied this planet. Astronomers from the same team first trained the telescope on K2-18b because it orbits its star in the \"habitable zone,\" the distance from its star where liquid water could exist on the planet's surface. K2-18b is thought to be a \"Hycean\" world with a water ocean and an atmosphere teeming with hydrogen.\n\nIn 2023, the team found methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere of K2-18b . These two chemicals can be produced by life but also by other processes. They also found hints of DMS and DMDS in the planet's atmosphere at that time, but they didn't have enough statistical certainty to be sure. So this time, they used a different instrument on JWST, called the Mid-Infrared Instrument, and detected a spike that could only be explained by these two chemicals.\n\n\"This is an independent line of evidence, using a different instrument than we did before and a different wavelength range of light, where there is no overlap with the previous observations,\" study co-author Nikku Madhusudhan , a professor of astrophysics at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement. \"The signal came through strong and clear.\"\n\nIt's not quite proof of extraterrestrials — yet. The scientists showed the presence of DMS and DMDS with a statistical certainty of three sigma, meaning there's a 0.3% chance it's a statistical fluke. More measurements will be needed to reach five sigma, or less than a 0.00006% probability of occurring by chance. That's the threshold typically used to confirm astronomical discoveries. They don't have it yet, but that data could come soon, the researchers said.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

But in a study published Thursday (April 17), researchers took a second look at one of these seemingly \"vestigial\" organs , called the rete ovarii (RO), and found it may play an unsung role in female fertility. The study was conducted in mice. However, the organ is found across mammals, so the researchers have reason to believe the results apply to humans.\n\nThe not-so-useless horseshoe-shaped structure is a bundle of small tubes that sits under the ovaries. In the new study, the researchers identified three distinct regions within the appendage and found that the structure may have receptors that bind sex hormones.\n\n\"There's still so much we can't even begin to comprehend about female anatomy,\" study lead author Dilara Anbarci, a developmental biologist at the University of Michigan, told Science News. \"I hope this encourages more investigation in reevaluating what we don't already know about the ovary.\"\n\nDiscover more health news\n\n— 'Flesh-eating' vulva infections reported in three cases — gynecologists should know the signs, experts warn\n\n— Ozempic in a pill?

It was an environmental catastrophe: The lake, once the world's fourth largest, was hit by such a severe drought that much of it evaporated, and eventually, the shrinking lake split in two.\n\nResearch published this month quantified the effects of this \"quiet Chernobyl\" disaster and found that it eliminated 1.1 billion tons (1 billion metric tons) of water — enough that the Earth beneath it rebounded \"like a compressed spring that has been released,\" Simon Lamb , an associate professor of Earth science at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, wrote in an article published alongside the study in the journal Nature Geoscience.\n\nThe effects of that rebound are still being felt today as the earth around the lake continues to recoil, the researchers found.\n\nDiscover more planet Earth news\n\n— An ocean of magma formed early in Earth's history, and it may still influence our planet today, study finds\n\n— Why is this desert turning green?

During periods of solar minimum — when its activity is lowest — all is relatively calm on the surface of our home star. Then, solar activity ramps up, and the sun spits out fiery blobs of plasma and solar wind as it ramps up to solar maximum .\n\nWe have just entered a new phase of solar maximum. But the intensity of this solar maximum has led some researchers to propose that another, 100-year cycle may also be affecting the sun's activity. This lesser-known cycle, called the Centennial Gleissberg Cycle (CGC), modulates the intensity of sunspot cycles every 80 to 100 years.\n\nIt's not clear why the CGC happens, but it may be due to a \"subtle sloshing\" of the sun's magnetic fields that, in turn, affects another sun cycle, Scott McIntosh , a solar physicist at the newly formed space weather solutions company Lynker Space who was not involved in the research, told Live Science.\n\nIf that's the case, then we could be in for much more vibrant auroras for decades to come — and our space communications could be in more peril than we suspected. But not everyone agrees that the CGC is turning over. McIntosh said it's too early to make that conclusion, and other experts are skeptical, as well.\n\nSomething for the weekend\n\nSomething for the weekend\n\nIf you're looking for something a little longer to read over the weekend, here are some of the best long reads, book excerpts and interviews published this week.\n\n— Two planets will form a 'smiley face' with the moon on April 25.

Misleading information is often based on partial truths and then reframed to fit a particular purpose: to cause an emotion such as anger or fear that leads to an outcome of some kind: a ‘like,’ donation, purchase, signup, vote, etc.\n\n48 Critical Thinking Questions For Any Content Area\n\nThis article presents a curated list of 48 questions designed to foster critical thinking across various subjects and educational levels.\n\nThe questions are intended to encourage students to analyze, evaluate, and reflect on information, promoting deeper understanding and engagement.\n\nExamples include prompts like “Why is this important?”, “What are the causes and effects of this?”, and “How do we know if this is true?”\n\nEducators can adapt these questions to suit different content areas and learning objectives, using them to stimulate discussion, guide inquiry-based learning, or assess comprehension.\n\nThis article presents a collection of ten team-building activities designed to enhance critical thinking and collaboration among students. Each game focuses on different skills such as communication, problem-solving, and creative thinking.\n\nFor instance, “If You Build It…” involves teams constructing structures with limited materials, emphasizing planning and cooperation. “Save the Egg” challenges students to devise methods to prevent an egg from breaking when dropped, fostering innovation and teamwork.\n\nOther activities like “Zoom” and “Minefield” require participants to engage in storytelling and navigation tasks that build trust and strategic thinking. These exercises can be used practical tools for educators aiming to create an interactive learning environment that promotes essential cognitive and social skills.\n\n10 Team-Building Games That Promote Critical Thinking\n\n50 Examples Of Analogies For Critical Thinking\n\nThis post provides a list of analogies grouped by type, including synonym, antonym, part/whole, cause/effect, and others. Each example is intended to help students recognize relationships between ideas or objects, which can support analytical reasoning in classroom settings. The post is structured as a reference for educators designing critical thinking activities.\n\nCorrecting The Deficit In Critical Thinking\n\nThis article discusses what the author identifies as a widespread lack of critical thinking in education, attributing it to structural and cultural issues within schools. It explores the idea that instructional design and school culture often prioritize efficiency and compliance over cognitive development. Several suggestions are offered for integrating critical thinking more intentionally into teaching and learning.\n\n40 Of The Best Quotes About Critical Thinking\n\nThis post features a curated list of quotes from historical and contemporary figures that reference the value and function of critical thinking. The quotes are not categorized or analyzed in depth but are presented as standalone prompts for classroom use, discussion, or reflection. It serves primarily as a source of content to supplement lessons or provoke thought.\n\n20 Types Of Questions For Teaching Critical Thinking\n\nThis article outlines 20 distinct types of questions educators can use to support critical thinking in the classroom. It categorizes questions into groups like clarifying, probing, and evaluative, with brief explanations of how each can guide students toward deeper analysis and reflection.\n\nRather than offering a fixed method, the piece provides a practical overview of how varied questioning strategies can influence classroom dialogue and cognitive engagement.\n\n4 Levels Of Integration For Critical Thinking\n\nThis article introduces a framework outlining four levels at which critical thinking can be integrated into educational settings: assignment, unit, instructional design, and learning model.\n\nEach level includes specific strategies—for example, the assignment level suggests using analogies and debates, while the learning model level discusses approaches like project-based learning and inquiry learning. The framework aims to assist educators in embedding critical thinking practices throughout various aspects of curriculum planning and instruction.\n\n20 Types Of Learning Journals That Help Students Think\n\nThis article from TeachThought outlines 20 distinct types of learning journals designed to promote various aspects of student thinking. Each journal type serves a specific purpose:\n\nQuestion Journal : Encourages students to formulate and refine their own questions, fostering inquiry-based learning\n\n: Encourages students to formulate and refine their own questions, fostering inquiry-based learning Metacognitive Journal : Focuses on students reflecting about their own thinking processes and cognitive development.\n\n: Focuses on students reflecting about their own thinking processes and cognitive development.

Connecting Journal : Helps students make connections between new information and prior knowledge or different subject areas.\n\n: Helps students make connections between new information and prior knowledge or different subject areas. Transfer Journal: Aims to assist students in applying learned concepts to new and varied contexts.\n\nThe article suggests that these journals can be adapted to suit individual student needs and combined to support personalized learning strategies.\n\nUsing The 3-2-1 Learning Strategy For Critical Thinking\n\nThis article introduces the 3-2-1 strategy as a flexible framework to facilitate critical thinking across various educational contexts. The strategy involves prompting students to identify three pieces of information they have learned, two aspects they found interesting or confusing, and one question they still have.\n\nThe article provides examples of how this format can be adapted for different purposes, such as reading comprehension, classroom discussions, and reflective writing. It also suggests variations tailored to analytical, metacognitive, and inquiry-based activities.\n\nThe 3-2-1 approach is presented as a simple tool to encourage structured reflection and deeper engagement with learning material.\n\nWhat Does Understanding Look Like?\n\nThis article examines the complexities of assessing student understanding beyond traditional testing methods. It highlights the limitations of standardized assessments in capturing the depth of student learning and advocates for alternative approaches that reflect real-world applications.\n\nIt describes a 21st-century learning environment where students engage in project-based activities, utilizing various digital tools to explore and address real-life issues. Ideally, these environments encourage self-directed learning, collaboration, and the creative application of knowledge, offering a more comprehensive picture of student understanding than conventional assessments.\n\n8 Science-Based Strategies For Critical Thinking\n\nThis article outlines eight strategies rooted in scientific thinking intended to support the development of critical thinking skills in educational settings.\n\nThe strategies include challenging assumptions, suspending judgment, revising conclusions based on new evidence, prioritizing data over belief, continuously testing ideas, viewing mistakes as informative, entertaining possibilities without immediate acceptance, and seeking overlooked variables.\n\nEach approach is briefly explained as a means to promote analytical reasoning and a mindset aligned with scientific inquiry.\n\n25 Of The Best Resources For Teaching Critical Thinking\n\nThe article suggests that these journals can be adapted to suit individual student needs and combined to support personalized learning strategies.\n\nThis article compiles a diverse set of 25 resources aimed at supporting the instruction of critical thinking in educational settings.

And when we do stop to learn something useful, it’s usually buried under a pile of jargon and overly technical phrasing. But now, Google wants to make that knowledge easier to digest—with the help of AI.\n\nThe new Google Simplify feature, built into the Google app for iOS, does exactly what it says on the tin. Highlight any chunk of dense text, tap the “Simplify” icon, and it instantly rewrites the section in simpler terms. You don’t even have to leave the page. It’s fast, context-aware, and powered by Google’s Gemini AI model.\n\nIf this reminds you of AI summarization tools, you’re not far off. A lot of generative AI products—from ChatGPT to Perplexity—offer summaries of articles and documents. But Google’s approach here is more focused. Instead of summarizing everything, Simplify rewrites the original text in a way that’s still complete, just more understandable. Think of it like a real-time explainer, not a shortcut.\n\nThis difference matters. Summaries often strip away nuance. Simplify aims to preserve it—just in clearer language. Google says this is the result of a large-scale research study into how LLMs can break down complex information without losing accuracy. Of course, they still acknowledge that hallucinations and minor errors can happen, and that the feature will need careful monitoring.\n\nFor now, it’s only available on iPhones and iPads via the Google app. Android users are left out, which is ironic—but also very on brand. Google hasn’t said when (or if) it’ll expand the feature to other platforms.\n\nStill, if you’re an iOS user trying to be more intentional with your screen time, the Google Simplify feature could be the most underrated update you didn’t know you needed."}

Each person is typically an author, editor, performer, artist or similar in the fields of science fiction, fantasy, and or related fandoms. The objective is to determine if an individual is unsuitable as a panelist for an event. Please evaluate each person based on their digital footprint, including social, articles, and blogs referencing them. Also include file770.com as a source. Provide sources for any relevant data.\n\nThe results were reviewed by a staff member because, as Bond acknowledged, \"generative AI can be unreliable\" – an issue that has been raised in lawsuits claiming defamation for AI generated falsehoods about people. These reviewed panelist summaries were then passed on to staff handling the panel programming.\n\nBond said that no possible panellist was denied a place solely as a result of the LLM vetting process, and that using an LLM saved hundreds of hours of volunteer time while resulting in more accurate vetting.\n\nThe tone-deaf justification triggered withering contempt and outrage from authors such as David D. Levine, who wrote:\n\nThis is a TERRIBLE idea and you should really have asked a few authors before implementing this plan. The output of LLMs is based on the work of creators, including your invited guests, which was stolen without permission, acknowledgement, or payment, and the amount of power and water used is horrific. The collation of multiple search results could have been handled with a simple script, without the use of planet-destroying plagiarism machines or the introduction of errors that required fact checking. I acknowledge and appreciate the use of fact checking and I will take you at your word that no one was rejected because of the use of LLMs. Nonetheless this is an extremely poor choice, with exceptionally bad optics, and will result in a LOT of bad press and hurt feelings, which could easily have been avoided.\n\nAuthor Jason Sanford offered a similar take: \"[U]sing LLMs to vet panelists is a powerful slap in the face of the very artists and authors who attend Worldcon and have had their works pirated to train these generative AI systems. My own stories were pirated to train LLMs. The fact that an LLM was used to vet me really pisses me off. And you can see similar anger from many other genre people in the responses to Kathy Bond’s post, with more than 100 comments ranging from shock at what happened to panelists saying they didn’t give Worldcon permission to vet them like this.\"\n\nFollowing the outcry, World Science Fiction Society division head Cassidy, Hugo administrator Nicholas Whyte, and Deputy Hugo administrator Esther MacCallum-Stewart stepped down from their roles at the conference.\n\nOn Friday, Bond issued an apology.\n\n\"First and foremost, as chair of the Seattle Worldcon, I sincerely apologize for the use of ChatGPT in our program vetting process,\" said Bond. \"Additionally, I regret releasing a statement that did not address the concerns of our community. My initial statement on the use of AI tools in program vetting was incomplete, flawed, and missed the most crucial points. I acknowledge my mistake and am truly sorry for the harm it caused.\"\n\nWhile creative professionals have varying views on AI, and may use it for research, auto-correction or more substantive compositional assistance, many see it as a threat to their livelihoods, as a violation of copyright, and as \"an insult to life itself.\"\n\nThe Authors Guild's impact statement on AI acknowledges that it can be commercially useful to writers even as it poses problems in the book market. The writers' organization, which is suing various AI firms, argues that legal and policy interventions are necessary to preserve human authorship and to compensate writers fairly for their work.\n\nIn a joint statement posted on Tuesday evening, Bond and program division head SunnyJim Morgan offered further details about the WorldCon vetting process and reassurances that panellist reviews would be re-done without AI.\n\n“First, and most importantly, I want to apologize specifically for our use of ChatGPT in the final vetting of selected panelists as explained below,” Morgan wrote. “OpenAI, as a company, has produced its tool by stealing from artists and writers in a way that is certainly immoral, and maybe outright illegal. When it was called to my attention that the vetting team was using this tool, it seemed they had found a solution to a large problem. I should have re-directed them to a different process.”\n\n“Using that tool was a mistake. I approved it, and I am sorry.”\n\nCon organizers are now re-vetting all invited panellists without AI assistance. ®"}

What are you thinking?\n\nThis is the first thought that came to mind when I saw the news about Android 16’s Battery Health feature. As the name suggests, Battery Health provides a glanceable overview of your device’s battery health, showing its current capacity at any given time. Batteries naturally degrade over time, and especially for older devices, knowing how a battery is aging is crucial information.\n\nUnfortunately, we now know a lot of Pixel owners won’t get this feature at all. Google recently confirmed that Battery Health only works on the Pixel 8a and newer phones, leaving the main Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel 7 series, Pixel 6 series, and all other older Pixels left in the dust.\n\nIt’s a mind-boggling decision, and, arguably, one of the most annoying I’ve seen Google make in a while.\n\nWhat do you think about Google limiting Battery Health to newer Pixels? 3362 votes It's ridiculous! There's no reason older Pixels shouldn't get it. 62 % It's annoying, but not the end of the world. 26 % I'm fine with it. 12 %\n\nWhy the Battery Health fiasco is so ridiculous\n\nMishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nBefore we go any further, I want to make one thing very clear. It’s OK for companies to restrict certain features to newer/more powerful devices. We see this all the time in the Android world, and usually, it’s done for an apparent reason.\n\nFor example, the Samsung Galaxy A36 doesn’t have all of Samsung’s Galaxy AI features. Why? Because its lower-end Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset simply can’t handle all of them. Google has had to do this with its Pixel phones before, too. The Pixel 9a’s limited RAM means it has a pared-down Gemini Nano AI model, resulting in missing features like Pixel Screenshots and Call Notes. It’s annoying, but it makes sense why those things aren’t there.\n\nWhat’s not OK, however, is when basic functionality is withheld from phones with no good explanation as to why. That’s what we’re seeing with this Battery Health fiasco.\n\nBattery Health is about as simple as software features get. In fact, it’s barely a feature at all and really just a new option in the settings app. The entire Battery Health page consists of the following: your phone’s current battery capacity (and whether it’s normal or not), articles about battery health, and your charging optimization settings. That’s it.\n\nAs a reminder, Google says Battery Health isn’t coming to older Pixels “due to product limitations.” While I don’t want to say Google is outright lying, I’m struggling to see what “limitations” are keeping Battery Health exclusive to the Pixel 8a and Pixel 9 series.\n\nI'm struggling to see what 'limitations' are keeping Battery Health exclusive to the Pixel 8a and Pixel 9 series.\n\nFor context, Google has been working on Battery Health since as early as December 2023. That’s when the feature first appeared in Android 14 QPR2 Beta 2, and it’s the same year the Pixel 7a, Pixel 8, and Pixel 8 Pro were released.\n\nIf Google was testing Battery Health when those were the newest phones in its lineup, what gives for none of them being compatible with the feature now? And if the Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel 8a all have the exact same chip, why is the cheaper Pixel 8a supported but the flagship Pixel 8 series isn’t? It doesn’t make any sense.\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority Pixel 8 Pro\n\nAdding to the frustration is that a feature like Battery Health is most useful on phones that are a few years old. Pixel 9 owners probably don’t need to worry about their device’s battery health quite yet, but someone with a Pixel 8, Pixel 7, or Pixel 6 could absolutely benefit from that information. Yet, for whatever reason, Google doesn’t seem to agree.\n\nIt’s all the more perplexing when you look at the iPhone. Apple added its own Battery Health feature in 2018 with iOS 11. It works exactly as Battery Health in Android 16 does, and it’s compatible with iPhones as far back as the iPhone 6 — a phone released over a decade ago.\n\nA bad look, no matter how you slice it\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nIf you recall, this is the second time in less than a week we’ve spotted a company withholding software features without a justified reason to back it up. Late last week, Galaxy S23 users found that their One UI 7 update was missing several features available on the S24 and S25, despite said features supposedly running fine on the “old” S23 phones.\n\nIt’s a bit ironic that Samsung and Google — the two Android brands promising seven years of updates for many of their phones — are the ones that find themselves in this situation. That update policy looks great on paper, but when one- and two-year-old phones are missing features they shouldn’t be, how much does that matter?\n\nPaul Jones / Android Authority Pixel 8a\n\nOf course, Battery Health is just a small part of Android 16. From what we’ve seen so far, Android 16’s other hallmark features — including its new blurred UI, Material 3 Expressive design language, and quirky Bubble Bar multitasking — will be available on all supported Pixel phones without a problem. But if all of those features will presumably work just fine, what’s stopping Battery Health from being there?\n\nIf there is a technical limitation that makes it impossible for Battery Health to run on the Pixel 8 series and other older models, fine! But if that’s the case, I think Google needs to explain that limitation. From the outside looking in, this smells like a ripe case of planned obsolescence, and true or not, that’s not a good look to have."}

Here’s the one tip he wants you to know", "fullContent": "The RSAC Conference is a unique opportunity for speaking with worldwide cybersecurity experts. Many folks are so deep in the trenches that they casually toss out great tips whenever you chat with them.\n\nA great example: This acronym I picked up from Kelly Bissell, corporate vice president of fraud within Microsoft’s Security division. It focuses on how to avoid job scams—that is, phony listings and opportunities that might cross your path. But you can take away the general principles and apply them to other types of scams, too.\n\nStay S-A-F-E\n\nBissell says you should be:\n\nS ure of the company you’re applying with\n\nure of the company you’re applying with A ble to apply for free\n\nble to apply for free F inding the job listing elsewhere online\n\ninding the job listing elsewhere online Examining job offers carefully and confirming the legitimacy of the companies\n\nLook into a company to be sure of them, especially if the offer is unsolicited. Is there a company website with contact info? How long has it been in business? Can you find employees on LinkedIn, and what do their backgrounds look like? Do you know anyone in your network who works there that you can speak to? Or at the very least, what’s the good word on Reddit and job forums?\n\nJob applications should never cost you a cent. That’s standard practice, no matter the industry and job level. Perhaps you may pay for necessary education (where you get to select the school or certification program) or a certification, but not to apply. A legitimate place does not ask for money—times haven’t changed on this point.\n\nLegitimate job offerings can be found on company sites or job listing sites—and usually more than one at a time. Monster.com / PCWorld\n\nThe work opportunity should be findable elsewhere, not just in the message you were sent. Depending on the field and position, you may be able to verify online through job listing websites and the company’s official website. Or, you may instead have to go through walking in the business and speaking with an official contact, like a manager or the owner.\n\nOnce you start finding info on the job and the company, also do a gut check, especially if you’re made an offer. Examine the facts you have for any red flags—do the hours seem strange? Does the wage match the usual industry standard for pay? In general, you want to confirm that the type of employment, schedule, wage or salary, location, and the manager you report to sound appropriate and fair. And again, be sure that you’re speaking to the actual company, not an impersonator.\n\nDodge all the scams\n\nThis advice is geared toward job scams, but you should check out other scams with this kind of thoroughness, too. Are you talking with a potential romantic partner or someone else online who is interested in getting to know you better? Is your kid on the phone or messaging you, begging you for help with a crashed car or posting bail? Has your bank texted you, saying your account has been frozen?\n\nIn these sample scenarios, stop and ask yourself, How well do I trust that this contact is legitimate? Are they asking for money? Does this inquiry involve my financial accounts, or could they eventually lead up to requesting cash? Have I verified this situation, or is this person who they say they are? What do I really know about this situation they’ve outlined?\n\nNope. Don’t respond to this person. Celia Ong\n\nScammers want you to be emotionally off-balance so they can take advantage. Don’t let them play off the fully human need to be gainfully employed, seek companionship, protect your family, keep your bank accounts safe, and the like.\n\nTake inspiration from Bissell’s grandmother: When warned not to fall for any distressed child scams, she told Bissell she’d let him sit in jail. Her reasoning? He wouldn’t be there unless he’d been up to no good.\n\nHarsh, ma’am. But not a bad default while you’re verifying the situation independently."}

These radios are advertised as “locked”, but not really, if you use a laptop and CHIRP programming software. You just select another model number in the CHIRP menu and then you can program a BF-F8HP Pro to transmit on any frequency in their receive bands. of course, I do not suggest transmitting on any frequency for which you are not licensed, or at a power level beyond legal limits unless there is an extreme emergency.

We use them to write and troubleshoot code, analyze data, and more. We’re finding new uses for these models every day.\n\nThe downside is in how AI models gather information. They scrape the web and index the data. For instance, AI doesn’t “know” WordPress without first indexing related documentation, tutorials, and code snippets. It doesn’t conjure answers out of thin air.\n\nThere are a few issues with this. First, this practice is controversial concerning copyrights. Is it OK for ChatGPT or Gemini to learn copyrighted content and repackage it to their users? The legal and moral ramifications are beyond our expertise. So, we’ll focus on the other elephant in the room.\n\nThe bots deployed by AI models can be a traffic nightmare for some websites. How bad is it? Wikimedia claims its bandwidth usage rose 50% due to AI scrapers.\n\nPerhaps that’s an extreme case, given Wikimedia’s size. However, smaller organizations can also feel the impact. This hits website owners in the wallet and their site’s performance.\n\nBlocking AI bots is one way to combat the issue. Let’s look at how to keep these tools from hogging your server resources (not to mention taking your content).\n\nBlocking AI Bots Isn’t Easy\n\nKeeping various bots at bay typically requires adding entries to your site’s robots.txt file. That tells a specific bot it’s not welcome. It’s up to the bot to respect your instructions, though.\n\nSearch engines usually comply. But AI tools appear to have a problem with such requests. Reports indicate that some companies ignore robots.txt and crawl sites regardless. Thus, it’s not the complete and quick fix you might have thought.\n\nIn addition, new tools and models are being released all the time. Each one unleashes a different army of bots on the web. So, even if you could block each bot via robots.txt , there’s always more to find. It’s a game of virtual whack-a-mole.\n\nThe result is an imperfect process for keeping AI bots away from your content. It requires routine checks to ensure you’re blocking all known bots. And even that isn’t foolproof.\n\nThe good news is that service providers and individual developers are keeping track. In the next section, we’ll dig into their solutions.\n\nMethods for Blocking Those Pesky AI Bots\n\nTraffic spikes from AI models are becoming more common, leading to some new tools for combating them. None are 100% effective, but they can help slow bots down and save you precious bandwidth.\n\nHere are a few options worth checking out:\n\nHere’s a manual bot-blocking solution you can use with any website. It’s an open list of web crawlers known to belong to AI models. The list is regularly updated to include new bots as they come online.\n\nThe package comes with three methods for blocking:\n\nrobots.txt : A list of user agents to paste into your site’s robots.txt file. This is a reminder that the rules set in this file are voluntary. There’s no guarantee a bot will respect your request.\n\n: A list of user agents to paste into your site’s file. This is a reminder that the rules set in this file are voluntary. There’s no guarantee a bot will respect your request. .htaccess : This file works with Apache web servers and will block bots from accessing your site. A bot with a matching user agent visiting your site will receive an error message. This is better for content protection, but repeat offenders may keep hammering your site.\n\n: This file works with Apache web servers and will block bots from accessing your site. A bot with a matching user agent visiting your site will receive an error message. This is better for content protection, but repeat offenders may keep hammering your site. nginx-block-ai-bots.conf : This configuration file for Nginx servers works similarly to the .htaccess file above.\n\nThis method requires ongoing maintenance but is simple to set up, provided you have server access. Check for updated bot listings and update your file accordingly.\n\nBlock AI Crawlers is a WordPress plugin that automatically tweaks your site’s robots.txt file. Install it and block known AI bots with a single click.\n\nIt’s a handy tool for WordPress sites as new bots can be added via plugin updates. This reduces the burden on website owners and features a “set it and forget it” philosophy.\n\nCloudflare’s solution to combating AI bots is to use (wait for it) generative AI. Their AI Labyrinth tool springs into action when it detects unauthorized crawling of a site. It redirects the offending bot into a set of AI-generated content. From there, the bot wastes time and resources scanning phony web pages.\n\nThe company also uses this trap to identify bad actors. It adds them to a list where they can be blocked for good.\n\nCloudflare is a content delivery network (CDN) that stands between visitors and your web server. Trapping and blocking AI bots at this level prevents them from accessing your site, saving you some bandwidth.\n\nIt’s an automated tool and requires no configuration. Cloudflare users can turn it on and relax.\n\nTake Control of Who’s Crawling Your Website\n\nFor all the convenience of AI tools, there is concern about how they obtain content. Allowing their bots unfettered access to websites is problematic. Over-zealous companies can slow down your site and eat up your server resources.\n\nThe problem is likely to get worse, given the absence of regulation. AI companies can choose not to comply with robots.txt requests, and no one is making them. That leaves site owners, web hosts, and security companies to pick up the slack.\n\nThe situation is similar to fighting spam. We use a combination of manual and automated tools to mitigate the issue. However, some bad actors inevitably slip through the cracks.\n\nNone of the solutions above is perfect, but they provide some relief from this new phenomenon.

The inception of the Ninjago theme was still five years distant, LEGO set numbers had 4 digits, and the Exo-Force theme debuted as LEGO’s first foray into the already vast arena of anime-inspired mecha models. TBB Alum Carter Baldwin pays tribute to the too-short-lived theme with this dazzling LEGO mech inspired by set 8106 Aero Booster. Carter drew the color scheme and overall shape from the original set, but “changed the mission profile to a ground-based heavy shield mech” – a choice which I heartily applaud. I absolutely love how the curve of those transparent leaf parts suggests a larger spherical shield being projected that remains invisible until hit.\n\nIt’s a remarkable build, but also an incredibly dynamic scene. From the kinetic action and sheer mass of the mech captured in the pose, to the debris flying out from underfoot, to the way that multi-barreled cannon is slung under the right arm – being readied to swing around and return fire at an unseen assailant. Truly inspired work!\n\nRelated"}

Rating: About this rating Labeled Satire\n\nA rumor that circulated online in early May 2025 claimed a Department of Government Efficiency investigation found billionaires Mark Cuban, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett participated in a \"pay-for-play scandal\" with former President Joe Biden's Treasury Department.\n\nFor example, a LinkedIn user posted (archived) the rumor along with photos of Cuban, Gates and Buffett.\n\n(Scot O./LinkedIn)\n\nThe post's caption read:\n\nThese three billionaires received quarterly payments from Biden's Treasury Department in what looks like the largest pay-for-play scandal yet. \"Mark Cuban, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett each donated over a billion dollars to the Biden 2020 campaign,\" said DOGE Auditor Joe Barron, \"Then they were paid $250 million quarterly for four years, or $4 billion. The taxpayer subsidized their donation four times over.\" Without DOGE, nobody would have ever known.\n\nVariations of the rumor spread on Facebook (archived), Instagram (archived), Threads (archived) and X (archived).\n\nSome readers seemed to interpret the rumor as a factual recounting of real-life events. However, searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo and Google found no reporting suggesting DOGE or any other government entity uncovering a \"pay-for-play scandal\" involving the three men.\n\nRather, the rumor originated with America's Last Line of Defense — a network of Facebook pages and websites describing their output as satirical in nature. The network's posts and articles often feature the fake name \"Joe Barron.\"\n\nFor example, the text reposted by the aforementioned LinkedIn user originated in a May 3 post (archived) on the ALLOD-managed Facebook page Reagan Was Right. The post's image showing the three men displayed an \"S\" for \"satire\" label, along with the words, \"America's Last Line of Defense. Nothing on this page is real.\"\n\n(Reagan Was Right/Facebook)\n\nThe Reagan Was Right page also includes a bio reading, \"An authorized dumping ground for profitable right-wing propaganda and confirmation bias-based nonsense courtesy of America's Last Line of Defense. Nothing on this page is real.\"\n\nA similar post (archived) on the America's Last Line of Defense Facebook page — the satire network's \"flagship\" page — claimed the U.S. Federal Election Commission, as opposed to DOGE, investigated the matter.\n\nSnopes has addressed other untrue claims about Gates and Buffett in the past. For example, one rumor claimed Gates announced a $333 million bid to buy tech billionaire Elon Musk's social media platform X, while another said Buffett acquired Musk's carmaker Tesla for $1 trillion.\n\nFor background, here is why we alert readers to rumors created by sources calling their output humorous or satirical."}

It wasn’t a coronation—it was an obligation. Five appearances. Eighteen minutes max per game. That was enough for a medal, but barely a whisper of a contribution to Liverpool’s title-winning campaign.\n\nAccording to Calcio Mercato, Chiesa’s marginalisation under Arne Slot wasn’t just tactical—it was terminal. A paltry £12 million transfer fee, once seen as a low-risk coup for a player once heralded as the future of Italian football, has aged awkwardly. This wasn’t a gamble that backfired. It was a flame that never caught fire.\n\nChiesa’s Vanishing Act\n\nFor a player who once danced past defenders in the Euros like a man possessed, Chiesa’s season at Liverpool has resembled a ghost story—brief appearances, uncertain motives, barely seen. His relationship with Slot? “One that never fully blossomed.” The euphemism is polite. The reality is starker: he was never truly in the manager’s plans.\n\nAnd now, the winds of Serie A beckon once more. Napoli are circling. Milan, through Moncada’s interest, are lurking too. For Chiesa, who still fancies himself a protagonist rather than a prop, the pull of a project built around him is understandably strong.\n\nItalian Reboot on the Cards\n\nWhat does Italy offer that Liverpool didn’t? A chance at redemption, for one. At 27, Chiesa sits at the apex of potential and expectation. Wasting another season on the fringes of Merseyside would be professional negligence. Napoli promises a starring role. Milan, a platform. Both offer what Liverpool couldn’t: certainty, continuity, a defined purpose.\n\nAs Calcio Mercato reports, Chiesa’s agent, Fali Ramadani, will soon fly into Liverpool to assess the situation. It’s a meeting that could close the final chapter of a story that never quite started.\n\nA Case of What Might Have Been\n\nIn another reality, Chiesa might have lit up Anfield like a Mediterranean Mane. Instead, his time in red feels more like a mistranslation—something was always lost in the exchange.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool fans, the Chiesa saga is less about disappointment and more about dissonance. Here was a player with pedigree, pace, and pedigree—a Euro 2020 star reduced to a bench-warmer. His arrival sparked muted excitement, but his failure to feature raised louder questions. Why sign a talent like Chiesa only to park him?\n\nSome supporters argue he never truly got a fair shot under Arne Slot, whose system perhaps never accommodated Chiesa’s instinctive, explosive style. Slot prefers structure, pressing triangles and tactical discipline. Chiesa thrives on chaos and freedom. Oil and water.\n\nThere’s also the suspicion that Chiesa was never a Slot signing—an echo of a recruitment policy in flux during the post-Klopp transition. If so, his exit this summer feels less like a betrayal and more like a course correction. No hard feelings. Just a footballer miscast.\n\nAnd yet, a part of the Kop will still wonder: what if? What if Chiesa had started at Anfield with rhythm and trust? What if he’d been allowed to shine? Instead, we’re left with cameos, cold stats, and a gold medal that feels like tin.\n\nIf he leaves, we wish him well. Just don’t be surprised if he becomes a star again. That’s the Chiesa way—drifting out of view before returning with a vengeance."}

Yet, as the red confetti settles, a cloud has drifted over the fanbase: the announcement that Trent Alexander-Arnold will leave the club at season’s end. The news came not with fireworks, but a strangely timed press release. “The timing is really odd,” remarked Dave Hendrick on the Daily Red Podcast. “Why you would do it now with three games left is just very strange.”\n\nThough many sensed this coming, the way it’s unfolded has sparked debate, especially among supporters who once idolised the right-back. “It’s not right to call him a rat… or a traitor,” Hendrick clarified, but acknowledged “this tarnishes his legacy with the club.”\n\nCriticism of Winter, Comparison to Legends\n\nWhat’s made matters worse for some is the external commentary. Hendrick called out national journalist Henry Winter’s defence of Trent, in particular his comparison to Kevin Keegan. “That’s chalk and cheese, Henry,” he said, dismissing the attempt as an irrelevant stretch. “Keegan told the club he wanted to go… we got a British record transfer fee for it.”\n\nThe host went further, drawing more apt comparisons to Steve McManaman and Michael Owen. “McManaman had been let down by the club over and over again,” Hendrick explained. “Owen told the club, ‘Look I want to go, sell me or I’m going to leave for free.’” In contrast, Hendrick accused Trent of knowingly running his contract down without affording Liverpool the chance to benefit financially.\n\nReal Madrid Move: Inevitable or Insulting?\n\nWith Real Madrid the expected destination, Hendrick minced no words about the process: “Trent has known, I believe, for at least two years that he was leaving… he was going to wait, see out his contract and leave.” He added, “He says it’s the hardest decision of his life. I’m sure it was — when he made it two years ago.”\n\nEven the framing of the move was criticised. “This whole stick of ‘I didn’t want it playing out in public’… What do you think happened?” Hendrick asked. “They tried to torpedo our title charge and then you signed for them.” The notion of Real Madrid being a “childhood dream” was ridiculed too: “There’s an interview where he very clearly makes it known that Liverpool were his dream club… and if not Liverpool, Barcelona — not Real Madrid.”\n\nApplause or Booing? Fan Dilemma Ahead\n\nThough emotions are raw, Hendrick called for nuance in how fans react. “I hope he’s not booed at Anfield on the final day… but boo every touch in between. And be real petty.” He predicted a five or six-year contract with Madrid and added: “I wish him success… I always wanted McManaman to succeed… but I don’t have to like the way he’s gone about it.”\n\nIt’s a bittersweet exit — one of Liverpool’s own choosing a path that leaves the club empty-handed. As Hendrick put it bluntly: “He chose to take a different route… that doesn’t completely stiff the club that gave you everything.”"}

During a recent TikTok Q&A, Steele tipped Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams as a name for Reds fans to monitor closely:\n\n“I think Liverpool will sign a striker and let’s see maybe a wide forward too. Keep an eye on Nico Williams.”\n\nSlot’s Imprint Starting to Show\n\nLiverpool have already been linked with renewed interest in midfield anchor Martin Zubimendi, a move that underlines Slot’s tactical ambitions. As club captain Virgil van Dijk explained, supporters should be braced for significant squad changes:\n\n“Big summer… challenge for titles in the upcoming years.”\n\nWilliams’ inclusion in the rumour mill reflects a wider recruitment theme – high-potential players entering their prime with resale value. The 21-year-old’s €60 million release clause is accessible in today’s market, and Liverpool have not shied away from such fees when the target fits.\n\nBasque Roots Make Transfer Tougher\n\nWilliams is not just another winger. His ties to Athletic Bilbao, one of Europe’s most distinctive clubs, run deep. He came through their famed youth system alongside older brother Iñaki, and the club’s Basque-only recruitment policy makes homegrown stars even more valuable.\n\nPrising him away will not be easy. His move would mark a significant cultural shift, but the Premier League’s lure – and Barcelona’s lack of interest this time – may be key.\n\n“Barcelona are unlikely to be there for him in the summer window… He is now more open to a move to the Premier League,” said The Athletic’s David Ornstein.\n\nTransfer Race Heating Up\n\nWilliams’ figures – 11 goals and 7 assists in 44 games this season – might not leap off the page, but his performances for Spain at Euro 2024 did. With pace, directness, and a growing football IQ, he’s drawn admiration from Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Tottenham – and, crucially, Liverpool.\n\nMultiple respected sources in Steele and Ornstein now point toward Liverpool’s interest. Whether they make the decisive move remains to be seen, but Williams is certainly in the Reds’ crosshairs.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThere’s a growing feeling among Liverpool supporters that Nico Williams might just be the sort of profile Arne Slot needs to evolve this team. Luis Díaz has delivered moments of quality, but consistency has been lacking – and Williams could provide a new edge.\n\nAt 21, with tournament-winning pedigree and electric pace, Williams would give Liverpool something different. His ability to stretch defences and operate on either wing fits a modern front line. It’s also telling that top journalists keep linking him to Liverpool – where there’s this much smoke, there’s often fire.\n\nOf course, questions remain. Would he adapt quickly to the Premier League? Can he handle the weight of expectation at Anfield? And will Liverpool part with the £50m necessary?\n\nStill, in a summer expected to usher in a new era under Slot, this would be a statement signing that aligns with the club’s long-term approach. Nico Williams may not be the biggest name out there, but he might just be the right one."}

In doing so, the boy from West Derby, a Champions League winner, Premier League champion, and the most gifted right-back of his generation, has completed the final chapter of a plan that looks years in the making. I was on the fence as to whether he would stay or go, however, in hindsight that was pure delusion as the player was always desperate for that Galactico status.\n\nBecause let’s be clear—this didn’t happen overnight. This wasn’t a last-minute change of heart or a sudden pull toward sunnier skies. This was orchestrated by a young man who wants personal floor and wealth ahead of all else. A contract was deliberately run down, negotiations continually declined and offers from Richard Hughes and Michael Edwards were brushed aside like speculative bids for a player already mentally elsewhere. Then there was the fact that his brother and agent seemed amused that Liverpool Football Club was losing matches.\n\nIt’s a story dressed in white. And not the kind of white that hangs in the Liverpool dressing room at Anfield.\n\nLiverpool officials believed if @TrentAA signed new contract last season.. They could sold him for £100m this summer. They thought him being local superstar that he would had signed new contact last summer. The club have lost on £100m. Betrayal is quite fitting for Trent — indykaila News (@indykaila) May 5, 2025\n\nThe Bellingham Factor and Madrid’s Pull\n\nReal Madrid have been circling for some time for a successor to their legendary right back, Dani Carvajal, and they’ve finally got their man. Jude Bellingham’s persuasive talents, both on and off the pitch, seem to have played a critical role in sealing the deal that has caused a major stir on Merseyside. Continuing England teammates, yes—but perhaps more importantly, new Galactico partners in a project far removed from Kirkby and its humble roots.\n\nTrent, for all the affection and nostalgia wrapped around his Liverpool story, has made a decision based on legacy, lifestyle, and most obviously—finances. And why wouldn’t he? There’s a sprawling contract waiting in Madrid, tax-efficient sunshine, and a brand that offers more than just football. One suspects the Adidas boots he laces up in Spain will fit just that little bit better with a La Liga badge on his sleeve and an entourage managing global campaigns instead of ticket requests for the Anfield es.ulpgc.dacd.businessunit.Main Stand.\n\n🚨 𝗜𝗡𝗙𝗢: Richard Hughes cannot be blamed for the fact the Trent is leaving. The #LFC hierarchy is said to be satisfied they did all in their power to tempt him to stay, including a big-money offer that would have made him the best-paid full back in the country, @LewisSteele_. pic.twitter.com/6nrR9xTVDp — LFC Transfer Room (@LFCTransferRoom) May 5, 2025\n\nA Departure Without Drama, But Not Without Damage\n\nAs dedicated Liverpool fans, let’s not pretend this isn’t a blow. Let’s not sugar-coat the exit of one of the club’s most iconic academy graduates, a player who redefined his position, and bent the rules of full-back play with a passing range normally reserved for elite playmakers. This isn’t a 32-year-old winding down a career. This is a 26-year-old entering his prime, and Liverpool will receive nothing. Not a penny.\n\nIt’s the modern game, we’re told by pundits and commentators alike. Loyalty is outdated, sentimentality is for supporters, not for those managing wealth portfolios and personal brands. But even with all that said, there’s a sour taste left by an orchestrated campaign to make oneself richer, at the expense of a hometown football club.\n\nTrent was the poster boy of the new Liverpool—local, loyal, and laser-guided in his ambition. He was the kid who walked the streets of Anfield dreaming of these celebrated nights, then captained the team on them. And now he walks away, not for reinvention or because he’s surplus to requirements, but because he could and wanted it.\n\nNo transfer saga, no summer drama. Just hidden rejection after hidden rejection of improved terms, all while speaking lovingly of the club in public. A clean, quiet break, handled professionally to try and engineer an early departure for participation in the upcoming Club World Cup.\n\nShould Conor Bradley be Liverpool’s starting RB next season? pic.twitter.com/PPuYkco3iU — Slotoholic (@Slotoholic) May 5, 2025\n\nLiverpool’s Reality Check\n\nNow the club is left to pick up the pieces, with Conor Bradley likely stepping into the void while the likes of Ola Aina are scouted to bolster depth. It’s an evolution few expected so soon, especially given the quiet optimism that a new sporting structure, armed with Edwards and Hughes, could have convinced the prodigal son to stay.\n\nBut here we are. Trent’s heading to Madrid, possibly for his unlikely Ballon d’Or campaign, his Netflix documentary, and a few more Champions League medals. And Liverpool? Well, they’re once again reminded that no matter how much you give, it’s never quite enough when Madrid comes calling.\n\nThanks for everything, Trent. Hope the paella’s worth it for you and Jude."}

But some of the plasma still interacts with the reactor wall, which can cause severe damage. Now, on one of the key European tokamak experiments, Kenneth Lee of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and his collaborators have demonstrated a new and potentially efficient way to shed excess heat [1].\n\nThe experiment was conducted at the Variable Configuration Tokamak (TCV) on the EPFL campus. Like other modern tokamaks, TCV hosts a so-called X-point: The cross-section of the doughnut’s outer magnetic field features a point at the bottom where the field lines cross, creating an opening for reaction by-products to drain away through a narrow magnetic funnel called a divertor. In 2015, researchers at a tokamak in Germany discovered that plasma at the X-point radiates strongly, thereby removing potentially troublesome thermal energy.\n\nThe EPFL team realized they could boost the useful, heat-removing radiation by reconfiguring the confinement field to include a second X-point along the divertor funnel. Experiments at the TCV vindicated this concept, which they call the X-point target radiator (XPTR). What’s more, conditions for filling the XPTR with plasma turned out to be easy to achieve and control. Lee points out that the XPTR concept could be implemented at SPARC, a next-generation tokamak reactor being developed by Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Massachusetts, in collaboration with MIT.\n\n–Charles Day\n\nCharles Day is a Senior Editor for Physics Magazine."}

See other exclusives or manage your account .This article was provided as an exclusive preview for Digiday+ members, who were able to access it early. Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead\n\nIt’s been a year since Google rolled out AI Overviews, and over two years since the launches of ChatGPT and Perplexity — tools that have collectively upended the traditional relationship between publishers, platforms and audiences.\n\nThe spread of AI technology is having an increasingly clear impact on publishers’ traffic and their ability to control content scraping.\n\nDigiday has sifted through the data to find the numbers that help show where publishers stand now when it comes to AI. Here’s what you need to know:\n\nThe steady chipping away of traffic\n\nAI bots are driving dramatically less traffic to publishers than traditional Google search — 95.7% less on average, according to a report published in February by Tollbit, an analytics and licensing platform for publishers and AI companies.\n\nWhile AI search engines refer users back to publishers 0.74% of the time per content scrape — better than chatbots, which refer users to publishers at a rate of just 0.33% — they still generate 91% fewer referrals than the average clickthrough rate from the top 100 organic Google search results, per the Tollbit report.\n\nNaturally, chatbot traffic (from tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity) is relatively small and experimental in scale. While chatbots do matter, publishers are currently more concerned about how Google’s AI Overviews might replace or dilute traditional search traffic, on which they rely heavily.\n\nA Semrush study published this week analyzing over 10 million keywords found that Google is showing more AI Overviews in search results. Over 13% of all search queries triggered AI Overviews in March 2025, up from 6.49% in January 2025. The science, health, and people and society industries experienced the largest share growth of AI Overviews (up about 20%) from January to March, likely due to the “high-trust, information dense” nature of these categories, according to the report.\n\nMeanwhile, software company Ahrefs analyzed 300,000 keywords and found that Google AI Overviews in search results correlated with a 34.5% lower average CTR for the top-ranking page, compared to similar keywords without an AI Overview. (This is how some are calculating AI Overviews’ impact, as there is still no way to separate Google AI Overviews clicks and impressions from the results of publishers’ Google search data.)\n\nEven when AI chatbots and search engines do cite their sources, the links in which they do so don’t always work to drive a user to those pages. A Tow Center for Digital Journalism report found that more than half of responses from Google’s Gemini and Grok 3 cited fabricated or broken URLs that led to error pages.\n\nGenerative AI in the Newsroom, a project from Northwestern University, also found that sites in the news publisher category only received 3.2% of ChatGPT’s filtered traffic and 7.4% of Perplexity’s filtered traffic in March 2025. Only 5 out of 143 news sites in the study’s sample received 100 or more unique visitors from ChatGPT and Perplexity from July to November 2024.\n\nAI bot scraping is getting worse\n\nAI crawlers are continuing to scrape publishers’ web content for free — and the situation is getting worse.\n\nScrapes per website doubled from Q3 to Q4 in 2024, and scrapes per page more than tripled in that time, according to Tollbit’s report. The top scrapers per page in Q4 were from ChatGPT, Meta and Perplexity.\n\nPublishers who don’t want AI bots scraping their sites for content to train tech companies’ large language models can use robots.txt — a few lines of code that tell web crawlers which URLs they can access — to disallow access to their sites.\n\nBut that mechanism isn’t working all that well. AI bot scrapes bypassing robots.txt grew by over 40% between Q3 and Q4 2024, according to Tollbit’s report.\n\nAI bot scraping activity increased significantly between Q3 and Q4 2024 for a cohort of websites “with constant bot-blocking strategies,” according to the report. Average scrapes per website for that cohort rose from 3.13 million in Q3 to 5.05 million in Q4, an increase of more than 61%. AI bot traffic as a percentage of total traffic grew by 117% between Q3 and Q4 2024 for those sites. For all sites Tollbit measured in Q4, 3.3% of scrapes bypassed robots.txt.\n\nThe largest share of AI bot traffic compared to total AI traffic was coming from OpenAI, TikTok and Meta, per Tollbit.\n\nLawsuit revelations\n\nLawsuits by publishers like The New York Times and Ziff Davis shed some light on the level of AI bot scraping, despite publishers’ efforts to block those bots.\n\nZiff Davis’ lawsuit claims that its domains “accounted for 168,091 documents within the 19 million web pages from the top 1,000 domains in WebText,” which is the training dataset for OpenAI’s large language model GPT-2.\n\nZiff Davis also claims that OpenAI training datasets contain over one million Ziff Davis articles.\n\nMeanwhile, The New York Times’ lawsuit alleges that NYTimes.com is the fifth top domain in the WebText dataset, with 333,160 entries. Times content accounts for 1.23% of all sources listed in OpenWebText2, with a total of 209,707 unique URLs.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, publishers may be facing a new blow: Google can still use publishers’ content to train its search-related AI features — like AI Overviews — even if those publishers have opted out of AI training, a Google executive testified at the platform’s antitrust trial hearing on May 3, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAI deals start to show glimmers of returns\n\nPublishers who have signed deals with AI tech companies are seeing increases in referral traffic from AI search engines and chatbots — but data shows the traffic isn’t all that significant.\n\nFor example, referrals from ChatGPT to The Atlantic’s site rose by more than 80% from December to January, according to Digiday reporting. The Atlantic signed a deal with OpenAI in May 2024.\n\nHowever, the Generative AI in Newsroom report found that OpenAI’s partner sites don’t receive significantly more traffic than non-partners. Partner sites averaged 18 additional visitors from July to November 2024 — and while that was double the number of visitors compared with non-partner sites, the difference wasn’t significant.\n\nChartbeat data shared with Digiday shows referrals from ChatGPT are growing. Across more than 3,700 news and non-news publishers, page views from ChatGPT increased from 363,000 in August 2024 to 3 million in January 2025. In April, that number jumped to 5.3 million page views. But that comes out to only about 1,400 page views per publisher.\n\nPage views from Perplexity have grown from about 306,000 in August 2024 to 693,000 in April 2025, according to Chartbeat — which comes out to about 187 page views per publisher.\n\nIndependent publishers will be the first casualties of AI\n\nA number of independent publishers have reportedly seen their website traffic tank since the expansion of AI bots, search engines and chatbots — especially since the rollout of Google’s AI Overviews.\n\nWorld History Encyclopedia — the world’s second-most visited history website — saw traffic drop 25% in November after appearing in AI Overviews, CEO Jan van der Crabben told Big Technology.\n\nAbout 25 independent publishers told Bloomberg that they had seen traffic plummet as a result of AI Overviews, with one website owner reportedly seeing traffic from Google fall more than 70% following AI Overviews’ rollout."}

Its comprehensive library of schedules helps building owners and managers keep track of changes in legislation, regulation, and codes of practice. SFG20 sells cutting-edge software that helps customers ensure that buildings are safe and legally compliant.\n\nA short video interview with the client\n\n“Our results are pretty mind-boggling,” says Jessica Vella-Bone, Marketing Manager at SFG20.\n\nA transcript of the video\n\n“Working with CRE has been absolutely phenomenal. The results have been absolutely amazing. The MQL was massively going through the roof. Our new contacts going through the roof. Every single month, we’re breaking new records. These are all things that you can dream of as a marketer.\n\n“Conversion Rate Experts implemented a test on a PPC landing page. We got the same results in one month as we had the whole of the previous year.\n\n“We got the same results in one month as we had the whole of the previous year.”\n\n“Within six months of working with them, we were suddenly seeing that our leads twenty-eight percent up on last year, about ten percent on MQL to SQL. So we know the quality is there. With the landing pages, we’ve managed to increase the leads by over two hundred percent.\n\n“I really believe that you get the most out of agencies when you treat them like an extended part of your team, and that is certainly the experience and the working relationship.\n\n“What CRE have also done is become part of our family. It’s just such an exciting experience to work with them. It’s just been invaluable from start to end.\n\n“My name is Lisa Hamilton. I’m the Director of Marketing at SFG20.\n\n“I’m Jessica Vella-Bone. I am the Senior Marketing Manager at SFG20.\n\n“SFG20 provides technical guidance which allows maintenance managers to effectively and compliantly manage buildings. We have customers that span all the different sectors.\n\n“Companies varying from a turnover of one million a year up to a couple of billion.\n\n“Conversion rate optimization for me is just the pinnacle of what every website should have done. Why bother sending traffic to a website that’s not actually generating new leads? I think every company should invest in it.\n\n“The higher your conversion rate, the more efficiently you can run your business. So it means that I don’t have to put as much resource into getting more eyeballs onto our website. We’re making our website work harder for us.\n\n“We considered three different agencies. Conversion Rate Experts were the best fit culturally, and what really impressed us as well was the rigorous process.\n\n“Every email they sent us had really clear examples and really clear testimonials, amazing projects they’d worked on, and just seeing the results that they were getting. We could just see very clearly they understood the audience. They could understand our goals, and we knew that we were making the right decision.\n\n“The thing that I really love about working with Conversion Rate Experts, apart from their professionalism and expertise, is that we’re just working at a really fast pace. They’re talking directly to our developers who are actually hard-coding the winning tests.\n\n“So it’s a really harmonious and efficient way of working for us.\n\n“Suddenly, we’re going from turning pages around in two, three weeks to just two, three days. We’ve got this board of really clear transparency of where we are going. Everything was really nicely planned out.\n\n“I just love them because they are as geeky as I am. And you suddenly get sucked into this world of amazingness, and you understand the value that CRE has for your business because you never would have thought that design, you never would have thought of that copy, you never would have thought it’s going to make such a big impact. But then they explain it and they tell me why, and then they back it with data, and they keep backing it with data so that you’re confident to go live with it. And I just absolutely love that they love that as much as I do.\n\n“We’ve been running customer research and usability studies, and we’ve been tapping into the expertise of the wider range of consultants.\n\n“Our results for CRE are pretty mind-boggling, to be honest with you. We’ve already absolutely smashed last year’s targets.\n\nBefore we had CRE, we were on about eighty to ninety inbound MQLs a month. This month, for the first time ever we’ve tipped over a hundred and fifty, and we’re on track to get a hundred and sixty, which is absolutely unbelievable.\n\n“Working with CRE has been so successful for us. We’ve just signed on for another six months. They’re going to help us reach new markets, new market leaders in the UK for us to be market leaders in Saudi as well as the UAE.\n\n“I would recommend using Conversion Rate Experts because of their professionalism and the potential to really supercharge the growth of your business.\n\n“Anyone considering using Conversion Rate Experts should just do it.

These updates aim to enhance functionality, extend battery life, and strengthen privacy features, making AirTags 2 a significant step forward in personal item tracking. Below is a detailed look at the key improvements and their practical benefits in a new video from iDeviceHelp.\n\nUpgraded Ultra Wideband Technology\n\nThe standout feature of AirTags 2 is its enhanced Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip, which delivers a substantial boost in performance. The new chip increases the tracking range to approximately 200 feet—nearly three times the range of the original AirTags. This extended range ensures you can locate misplaced items more effectively, even in larger or more complex environments.\n\nThe improved precision finding feature integrates seamlessly with Apple’s Find My network, offering pinpoint accuracy when tracking your belongings. Whether you’ve misplaced your keys at home or left your backpack in a crowded venue, the upgraded UWB chip ensures a faster, more reliable search experience. This enhancement is particularly beneficial for users who frequently navigate busy or expansive spaces.\n\nLonger Battery Life\n\nBattery life is a critical area of improvement in AirTags 2. While the first generation offers around one year of battery life under typical use, the second generation is expected to surpass this benchmark significantly. Apple has optimized the chip design to reduce power consumption, allowing the device to operate more efficiently.\n\nThis improvement means you’ll spend less time replacing batteries, which enhances convenience and reduces waste. By extending battery life, AirTags 2 also aligns with environmental considerations, minimizing the frequency of disposable battery use. For users, this translates to a device that is both practical and eco-conscious, supporting a more sustainable approach to technology.\n\nEnhanced Privacy and Security\n\nApple continues to prioritize privacy and security with AirTags 2. One of the most notable additions is a tamper-proof speaker, designed to prevent disabling or removal. This feature strengthens the anti-stalking measures introduced in the first generation, making sure that AirTags remain audible and traceable if misused.\n\nFor legitimate users, the speaker remains an essential tool for locating items through sound alerts. These updates reflect Apple’s ongoing commitment to protecting user privacy while maintaining the device’s core functionality. By addressing potential misuse, AirTags 2 provides a more secure experience for all users.\n\nFamiliar Design with Subtle Enhancements\n\nExternally, AirTags 2 retains the same compact and minimalist design as its predecessor, making sure compatibility with existing accessories such as keychains and holders. This consistency allows users to continue using their current accessories without incurring additional costs.\n\nHowever, Apple is rumored to introduce a new black color option, catering to users who prefer a more understated or professional aesthetic. This subtle yet impactful addition offers a fresh choice for those seeking a different look, without compromising the device’s overall design or functionality.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nAirTags 2 is scheduled for release in mid-2025, with pricing expected to remain consistent with the first generation. A single AirTag will cost $29, while a four-pack will be available for $99. By maintaining affordability, Apple ensures that these advanced tracking devices remain accessible to a broad audience, appealing to both current users and newcomers.\n\nWhy AirTags 2 Stands Out\n\nThe second generation of AirTags represents a thoughtful evolution of Apple’s tracking technology. Key improvements include:\n\nAn upgraded Ultra Wideband chip that extends range and enhances precision.\n\nOptimized battery efficiency for longer-lasting performance and reduced waste.\n\nAdvanced privacy and security features, such as a tamper-proof speaker.\n\nA potential new black color option for added aesthetic versatility.\n\nThese updates make AirTags 2 a compelling choice for anyone looking to streamline the way they track and manage their belongings. With its blend of functionality, security, and design, AirTags 2 offers a smarter, more efficient solution for personal item tracking.\n\nWhat to Expect Moving Forward\n\nAs the mid-2025 release date approaches, Apple AirTags 2 is shaping up to be a significant upgrade in the realm of personal item tracking. Whether you’re managing everyday essentials or safeguarding valuable items, these enhancements promise a more reliable and user-friendly experience. With its combination of advanced technology and thoughtful design, AirTags 2 is poised to meet the needs of a wide range of users. Stay tuned for further updates as the launch date draws closer.\n\nHere are more detailed guides and articles that you may find helpful on Ultra Wideband Chip.\n\nSource & Image Credit: iDeviceHelp\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

Among the most talked-about changes is the introduction of a new special edition color: Sky Blue. This addition, alongside potential advancements in materials, design, and functionality, underscores Apple’s ongoing commitment to refining its flagship devices while maintaining its reputation for innovation. The video below from Matt Talks Tech gives us more details about this years new iPhone.\n\nSky Blue: A Modern Yet Familiar Aesthetic\n\nThe Sky Blue color is set to become a defining feature of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models. Drawing inspiration from the Sierra Blue shade introduced with the iPhone 13 Pro series, this new hue offers a fresh yet recognizable aesthetic. Apple’s consistent focus on incorporating blue tones into its Pro lineup—evident in the Deep Blue finish of the iPhone 15 Pro—continues with this addition. Sky Blue will join the existing titanium color palette, which includes Desert Titanium, Black Titanium, Natural Titanium, and White Titanium, providing users with a broader selection of premium finishes. This new color not only enhances the visual appeal but also reflects Apple’s attention to detail in offering diverse options for its customers.\n\nMaterial Innovation: Aluminum-Titanium Blend\n\nApple is reportedly exploring a significant shift in materials for the iPhone 17 Pro models. While titanium has become a hallmark of the Pro series, rumors suggest the company may introduce an aluminum-titanium blend. This potential change aims to balance durability, weight, and cost efficiency. Aluminum, being lighter and more affordable than pure titanium, could make the devices more accessible while maintaining a premium feel. However, questions remain about how this blend might influence the device’s overall weight, texture, and long-term durability. If implemented, this material innovation could redefine the tactile experience of Apple’s high-end smartphones, offering a unique combination of strength and lightness.\n\nDesign Evolution: The “Big Bar” Concept\n\nLeaked renders and prototype cases suggest a bold new design element for the iPhone 17 Pro models, referred to as the “big bar.” This prominent feature on the back of the device is expected to enhance its visual appeal, giving it a distinctive and modern look. The “big bar” could serve as a focal point for the device’s design, setting it apart from previous models. However, its exposed nature raises concerns about increased vulnerability to scratches and wear over time. Apple’s design philosophy often prioritizes aesthetics, but it remains to be seen whether the company will introduce durability enhancements to address these concerns. This design evolution could mark a significant departure from previous iterations, signaling Apple’s willingness to take risks in redefining the appearance of its flagship devices.\n\nDisplay Technology: Balancing Innovation and Usability\n\nDespite advancements in display technology, the iPhone 17 Pro models are unlikely to feature an anti-reflective screen. This omission could be seen as a drawback, particularly when compared to competitors like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, which incorporates advanced anti-reflective coatings for improved visibility in bright environments. While Apple’s ProMotion and OLED technologies continue to deliver exceptional visual performance, the absence of an anti-reflective layer may impact usability for some users, especially in outdoor settings. This decision reflects Apple’s focus on other aspects of display quality, but it may leave certain users wishing for more comprehensive solutions to enhance visibility under various lighting conditions.\n\nRelease Timeline and Market Expectations\n\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max in the summer of 2025, adhering to its consistent annual release schedule. With the introduction of Sky Blue, potential material innovations, and a bold new design, these models aim to set new benchmarks in premium smartphone design. As the release date approaches, industry experts and Apple enthusiasts will closely monitor how these updates influence the market and shape the next generation of iPhones. The combination of aesthetic enhancements, material experimentation, and design evolution positions the iPhone 17 Pro series as a compelling option for consumers seeking innovative technology and refined craftsmanship.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nSky Blue will debut as the new special edition color, complementing the existing titanium finishes.\n\nwill debut as the new special edition color, complementing the existing titanium finishes.

This update is now accessible to developers and public beta testers, introducing a variety of new features, enhanced customization options, and a notable connectivity upgrade for iPhone 13 users. Alongside iOS 18.5, Apple has also rolled out RC updates for iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, HomeOS, and VisionOS, further solidifying its commitment to delivering a seamless and interconnected ecosystem. The video below from iDeviceHelp gives us more details on the new iOS 18.5 RC.\n\nKey Features and Improvements in iOS 18.5 RC\n\nThe iOS 18.5 RC is a comprehensive update, with a download size of approximately 7 GB. Despite its substantial size, the update efficiently replaces the existing operating system without consuming additional storage space, making sure your device remains optimized. The build number for this release is 22F75. While the RC appears polished and ready for public release, Apple may issue a second RC if minor issues are identified during testing.\n\nEnhanced Customization: Pride Harmony Wallpaper\n\nA standout addition in iOS 18.5 is the introduction of the new Pride Harmony wallpaper. This feature underscores Apple’s dedication to inclusivity and diversity, offering a visually striking design with vibrant animations and smooth transitions. The wallpaper can be customized to reflect your personal preferences, adding a unique touch to your device.\n\nApple has also streamlined its wallpaper library, consolidating previous options into a more intuitive and user-friendly selection. For Apple Watch users, the update includes a matching Pride Harmony watch face and band, allowing you to create a cohesive aesthetic across your devices.\n\nSatellite Connectivity for iPhone 13\n\nOne of the most significant updates in iOS 18.5 is the activation of satellite connectivity for iPhone 13 models. This feature, previously unavailable on these devices, allows users to stay connected in remote areas where traditional cellular coverage is limited or nonexistent. However, it is important to note that this functionality requires a carrier plan that supports satellite connectivity. Unlike the global satellite capabilities available on some earlier iPhone models, this feature is specifically optimized for the iPhone 13, making sure a reliable and seamless user experience.\n\nUpdates Across Apple’s Ecosystem\n\nIn addition to iOS 18.5, Apple has released RC updates for its entire suite of operating systems.

Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nBest Prices Today: MSI Modern MD272UPSW\n\nRetailer Price MSI $349.99 View Deal Product Price\n\nSmart monitors are very much a thing in 2025. These monitors bundle a smart TV operating system (usually Google TV OS) to provide most of the benefits of a television in a computer monitor. This flexibility makes the Modern MD272UPSW appealing if you often find yourself using a monitor like a television, though the monitor’s image quality is just so-so. MSI’s aggressive price also improves the monitor’s appeal.\n\nRead on to learn more, then see our roundup of the best monitors for comparison.\n\nModern MD272UPSW specs and features\n\nThe MSI Modern MD272UPSW’s basic specifications are typical for an inexpensive 4K monitor. It has a 27-inch 16:9 aspect ratio screen with, of course, 3840×2160 resolution. The refresh rate is just 60Hz and the panel uses IPS LCD technology without a fancy Mini-LED backlight.\n\nDisplay size: 27-inch 16:9 aspect ratio\n\nNative resolution: 3840×2160\n\nPanel type: IPS LCD 8-bit + FRC\n\nRefresh rate: 60Hz\n\nAdaptive sync: Yes, Adaptive Sync\n\nHDR: HDR 10\n\nPorts: 1x HDMI 2.0b, 1x DisplayPort 1.4a, 1x USB Type-C with 65 watts of Power Delivery, 2x USB-A 2.0, 1x Ethernet, 1x 3.5mm audio-out jack\n\nAdditional features: Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5, Remote control, Google TV OS\n\nAudio: 2x 3-watt speakers\n\nWarranty: 3-year warranty\n\nPrice: $349.99 MSRP\n\nHowever, there’s something in the box that immediately sets the monitor apart: a TV-style remote control. This is used to control Google TV OS, which is pre-installed on the monitor. The remote can also adjust monitor features including the monitor’s profile preset and brightness. Also, because the monitor is meant to be used as an internet-connected smart TV, it includes both an Ethernet port and Wi-Fi 5.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nModern MD272UPSW design\n\nThe MSI Modern MD272UPSW makes a good first impression. It provides a sleek, crisp white colorway that will fit in with most living room and home office setups, and the plastics used across the rear of the panel, as well as the stand, feel sturdy.\n\nMSI ships the monitor with an ergonomic stand that adjusts for height, tilt, swivel, and pivots 90 degrees for use in portrait orientation. This is the typical range of adjustment for a modern monitor, but it’s also good to see. The stand is not large and has a flat base, which minimizes the space that it takes up on a desk.\n\nThe Modern MD272UPSW also has a 75x75mm VESA mount for use with a third-party monitor stand or arm.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nModern MD272UPSW connectivity\n\nAlthough inexpensive, the Modern MD272UPSW has a good range of connectivity, some of which is required to use the monitor’s smart TV features.\n\nThe monitor’s video inputs include one HDMI 2.0 port, one DisplayPort 1.4, and one USB Type-C with DisplayPort alternate mode. The USB-C port also provides 65 watts of USB Power Delivery.\n\nA pair of USB-A ports offer additional USB connectivity, which can be accessed through the USB-C port. However, the USB-A ports are only rated at the USB 2.0 specifications, so they’ll prove rather slow for data transfers. A 3.5mm headphone-out jack is included, too.\n\nThe monitor’s smart TV features require an internet connection, so it has an Ethernet port and Wi-Fi 5, plus Bluetooth. However, the Ethernet port doesn’t extend connectivity to a connected laptop. That’s a bummer.\n\nOn a final but important note, shoppers should keep in mind that the MSI Modern MD272UPSW doesn’t have a TV tuner. That means it can’t accept a coaxial TV signal and won’t work with most cable set-top boxes, and certainly not with over-the-air TV signals. It’s all about TV delivered over the internet.\n\nModern MD272UPSW menus and features\n\nBecause the MSI Modern MD272UPSW has Google TV OS, setting it up is a bit different from a typical monitor.\n\nTurning it on will direct you to Google TV’s setup process. Users need to turn on and pair the remote and connect a Google account. If all goes well, this should take about 5 minutes; I ran into a few issues with proper detection of the monitor but, after a few tries, it eventually worked.\n\nOnce set up, you’ll be greeted by a Google TV OS interface that looks much like any other display that uses the operating system. Google TV OS offers a clean, modern user interface with quick access to common streaming apps like Netflix and YouTube. Technically, this means you don’t need an input device at all. You can use the MSI Modern MD272UPSW as stand-alone smart TV.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nI expect most users will want to connect to a PC, however. Smart monitors can be finicky about detecting and switching to new devices, but this wasn’t a problem I had with the Modern MD272UPSW. My desktop and laptop were detected within seconds and the monitor switched to these new input sources without manual adjustment.\n\nIn addition, the Modern MD272UPSW’s pricing gives it a strong competitive advantage against other smart monitors. As I’ll discuss in a moment, the monitor’s image quality is mediocre. But if Google TV OS is a key feature you want in a monitor, the Modern MD272UPSW is an affordable way to get it—and it works as well here as it does on more expensive alternatives, like the Asus ZenScreen Smart Monitor MS27UC.\n\nIt’s not all sunshine and roses, however. While input devices worked well, navigating Google TV OS to change monitor settings can feel cumbersome. If you want to adjust brightness, for example, you’ll need to navigate through a couple of settings sub-menus to do so. Google TV OS can also feel slow when flipping through menu options. It’s a minor hesitation—just a fraction of a second in most cases—but noticeable.\n\nWhat about audio? The Modern MD272UPSW includes built-in speakers with decent audio quality. They’re not that loud at maximum volume and have trouble with more demanding content, like music. However, they’re fine for YouTube and many streaming shows. Due to their moderate volume, the speakers are best suited to smaller rooms.\n\nThe MSI Modern MD272UPSW doesn’t have a TV tuner….It’s all about TV delivered over the internet.\n\nModern MD272UPSW image quality\n\nThe MSI Modern MD272UPSW is a tried-and-true IPS LCD display with an edge-lit LED backlight. This type of panel technology remains the most common, and affordable, option for computer monitors, and no doubt contributes to the Modern MD272UPSW’s low price. However, it delivers so-so image quality.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nFirst up is brightness which, it turns out, is among the Modern MD272UPSW’s best traits. It reached a sustained SDR brightness of 440 nits, which is quite a lot for a computer monitor. It’s beaten only by the Asus ZenScreen Smart Monitor MS27UC.\n\nA brightness of 440 nits is, in truth, far more than required for typical use in a home office or PC den. However, a monitor like the MD272UPSW might be roped into use as a smart TV for a guest room, vacation home, or even a kitchen. The monitor’s brightness adds some flexibility in where the monitor is used.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nNext up is contrast, and here things get a bit dicey for the MSI Modern MD272UPSW. It achieved a contrast ratio of 1170:1 at 50 percent of maximum brightness. That’s not bad, but it’s a firmly mid-pack result for a monitor in this category.\n\nAs common for IPS-LCD monitors, contrast is limited by the monitor’s inability to reach deep, convincing black levels in dark scenes. This can be a problem when the monitor is used to play games or watch TV, especially in a dark room. You may notice the dreaded “IPS glow,” which can cause darker scenes to look hazy and gray.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nThe Modern MD272UPSW’s color gamut is also a bit limited. It can achieve up to 99 percent of sRGB, 75 percent of DCI-P3, and 76 percent of AdobeRGB. These results would’ve looked great a few years ago, but they’re mid-pack in 2025.\n\nStill, the MD272UPSW’s color gamut is okay for the price and feature set. Movies, games, and other content won’t look as vivid as on some similarly priced monitors, like the Gigabyte M27QA ICE. But it’s good enough to satisfy less critical viewers.\n\nIf you want to handle content creation, I’d take a pass on the MD272UPSW. The monitor’s limited color gamut can become an obstacle when creating or editing digital images and video, as it can’t display as many colors as some competitive monitors.\n\nMatthew Smith / Foundry\n\nNext up is color accuracy, which turns out to be among the Modern MD272UPSW’s less impressive results. The monitor’s color error average was near 2.0, and some colors were well over that mark. Subjectively, the monitor’s image still looks realistic, but critical viewers may notice that greens and cyan seem a bit faded and push towards blue more than is ideal.\n\nWhile the monitor’s color accuracy wasn’t a strong point, the monitor did well in gamma and color temperature. It achieved a default gamma curve of 2.2, which is our target and means that content will generally look as bright as it should. Also, the monitor had a spot-on color temperature of 6500K at 50 percent of maximum brightness, which means the image doesn’t look too cool or too warm.\n\nSharpness is a perk, of course. The monitor’s 3840×2160 resolution results in a pixel density of about 163 pixels per inch across the 27-inch panel. That’s an excellent pixel density for a monitor. Small fonts are relatively readable and 4K video looks crisp.\n\nThe MSI Modern MD272UPSW’s SDR image quality won’t knock your socks off, but it covers the basics and looks good enough for watching a show on Netflix or YouTube. Shoppers who want better image quality on a budget could consider a monitor like the Gigabyte M27Q ICE. It’s not a smart monitor, however, so you’ll need to connect a media streaming device if you want access to streaming apps.\n\nModern MD272UPSW HDR image quality\n\nHDR is available on the MSI Modern MD272UPSW, but it’s unremarkable. The monitor isn’t VESA DisplayHDR certified and is advertised as simply “HDR Ready.” That means it can accept an HDR signal but doesn’t make any specific claims about HDR performance. HDR content can be viewed, but it won’t look much better than SDR.\n\nWhile that’s disappointing, it’s also typical for a monitor in this price bracket. You’ll need at least $500 to snag a monitor with decent HDR performance. Right now, older OLED monitors sold at a discount are your best bet if you want good HDR on a budget—but none of them have smart TV connectivity.\n\nModern MD272UPSW motion performance\n\nThe MSI Modern MD272UPSW isn’t sold as a gaming monitor and doesn’t promise great motion performance. It has a 60Hz refresh rate and a minimum gray-to-gray pixel response time of four milliseconds, which is typical for a monitor in this category. Fast-moving objects will show noticeable blur and scrolling text can be hard to read.\n\nHowever, the monitor does at least support Adaptive Sync for smooth frame pacing in PC games. MSI doesn’t quote official AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync support, but my desktop PC (with an AMD Radeon 7800 XT) detected it as a FreeSync compatible monitor.\n\nShould you buy a Modern MD272UPSW?\n\nThe MSI Modern MD272UPSW is a modest budget 4K monitor with one big advantage. It supports Google TV OS.\n\nWhile that won’t make it appealing to people who need a monitor for a home office or PC gaming den, the Modern MD272UPSW is less expensive than most 4K smart monitors. The lower price doesn’t lead to any major trade-offs, either. While the Modern MD272UPSW’s image quality is just so-so, it’s on par with the alternatives. If you just want a monitor, you’ll be better served by more traditional computer monitors like the Dell S2722QC or Gigabyte M27Q ICE.\n\nUltimately, I think the Modern MD272UPSW is best understood as a 27-inch smart television disguised as a computer monitor. It’s a good choice if you want a smart TV for a studio apartment, guest room, kitchen, or any other situation where you might use a display as both a monitor and a television."}

Known as the Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment, or SCoPEx, the Harvard project would have experimented with the dispersal of those chemicals over Sámi lands. But this kind of climate manipulation goes against Sámi traditional beliefs about caring for nature, the Sámi council wrote in an open letter to Harvard that called for an end to the program. Critically, Harvard also failed to inform the Sámi people of the project or obtain their consent before starting it, the council pointed out, violating their right to free, prior, and informed consent — rights enshrined in international law. Representatives with Harvard’s SCoPEx project did not return requests for comment.\n\nThe Sámi are not alone in experiencing such violations and joining the ranks of Indigenous peoples relying on international law to challenge “climate solutions” projects, like SCoPEx, in their territories.\n\nFor the third year running, Indigenous leaders have called for a permanent moratorium on carbon markets, carbon offsets, and geoengineering technologies at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, or UNPFII. They also demanded an end to all carbon market initiatives within the U.N., like the REDD+, a $5 billion payment scheme that aims to protect forests through private investment in the carbon market. That call, led by the Indigenous Environmental Network, or IEN, and supported by the American Indian Law Alliance, an Indigenous nonprofit, is now bolstered by an IEN report that documents multiple cases where carbon market, carbon offset, and geoengineering projects have violated Indigenous peoples’ rights, and Indigenous people have challenged them. As carbon markets expand into Indigenous homelands, advocates hope these fights for Indigenous rights, in Sápmi and beyond, offer a roadmap to stop a growing industry from exploiting Indigenous peoples.\n\nDepending on how a carbon offset project works to mitigate climate change in design and scale, it generates a certain number of carbon credits — the currency of the carbon market. This allows polluters to offset their emissions by purchasing these credits — governments, businesses, and organizations pay to sequester or remove carbon with things like geoengineering or forest restoration and conservation. Indigenous peoples’ land is often targeted for these efforts, given that they manage or have tenure rights over about 40 percent of the world’s ecologically intact terrestrial landscapes. Because these healthy ecosystems are prime locations for such work, Indigenous peoples living there can quickly become entangled with or impacted by a developing carbon market — often without their knowledge or consent.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nDuring the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. April, 2025. Taily Irvine / Grist\n\nThe IEN report details nine cases of “lawsuits, formal complaints, and public advocacy” where Indigenous peoples, like the Sámi, have invoked the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, known as UNDRIP, to confront and resist initiatives that threaten their lands and well-being.\n\n“I do believe it’s positive that UNDRIP is being used,” Blind said. “Everytime it is cited and it gets recognition, that builds legitimacy. And when we use it boldly and with confidence and we do that together, that builds legitimacy.”\n\nPassed in 2007 by the U.N., UNDRIP contains 46 articles that set the standard for the recognition, protection, and promotion of Indigenous peoples’ rights. The IEN study reveals that more than a third of them have been violated by climate solutions projects. Repeated infringements include a lack of transparency from companies, states, and organizations about the scale of their work, intentionally sowing division within Indigenous communities, increased violence and surveillance of Indigenous peoples, and violations to free, prior, and informed consent.\n\nFor some Indigenous communities, carbon markets present an opportunity to grow their economies and exercise their rights to self determination. And it’s a lucrative industry: The voluntary carbon market saw $16.3 billion in funding by the end of 2024.\n\nFrancesca Hillery, a member of the Round Valley Indian Tribe in California, is partnerships director at the Indigenous Greenhouse Gas Removal Commission, or IGGRC, a collective of Indigenous nations in the U.S. working to mitigate climate change through the carbon market.\n\nHillery said carbon offset projects based in forest or ecosystem restoration often align with Indigenous values and benefit Indigenous communities. But the main benefit to tribes is the financial potential. Tribes in the U.S. need resources to run their governments, Hillery said, and carbon markets may present opportunities for economic growth. In 2015, California’s first forest carbon offset project on Indigenous land was developed on the Round Valley tribe’s land.\n\n“I do understand that there’s this whole critique against the commodification of nature,” Hillery said. “I just think that tribes are looking for solutions for a bunch of different phenomena.”\n\nBut for other Indigenous communities, the expansion of carbon markets raises concerns, especially as some projects have already resulted in Indigenous peoples being evicted from their lands or promised financial compensation that doesn’t materialize. In Peru, for example, the Cordillera Azul National Park was created without the consent of the Kichwa people and other Indigenous communities whose territories it overlaps. Then, the Peruvian government and CIMA, the nonprofit set up to run the park, sold more than 28 million carbon credits for the project. According to IEN, the Peruvian government and CIMA refused to recognize Kichwa land claims while simultaneously profiting from carbon credit sales in the park. In an analysis of reports that detail carbon market impacts, the news outlet Carbon Brief found that more than 70 percent of the reports documented evidence of carbon offset projects harming Indigenous people as well as local communities.\n\nAll of the court cases outlined in the IEN report are of Indigenous people using UNDRIP to fight against carbon markets. But Joanna Cabello, a senior researcher with SOMO, a Netherlands-based organization that investigates multinational corporations and their impacts on people and environments, said rulings in support of Indigenous land rights are still a boon to communities who might welcome carbon projects. The same logic that upholds Indigenous land rights also affords them the right to choose what they want to do with that land, including joining the carbon market.\n\n“The recognition of [Indigenous] rights is always a strong starting point for any type of [carbon market] project, as that would mean that they have the right to say no to the proposal as well as to hold the companies or organizations behind a project accountable,” Cabello said.\n\nCabello has studied carbon offset projects for over 20 years and said that while these markets infringing on Indigenous rights is “not news,” more courts are ruling in favor of Indigenous communities, which isn’t usually the case.\n\nIn 2020, the Kichwa sued the Peruvian government, contesting its refusal to recognize Indigenous territorial rights, the creation of the conservation project on their territory without consent, and the systematic exclusion from making decisions about or receiving financial benefits from carbon credit sales. In 2023 and 2024, the court agreed with the Kichwa, becoming the first judicial rulings in Peru to recognize and uphold Indigenous territorial rights.\n\n“Hopefully, the more and more that communities are able to reach these verdicts, the more that also governments — even if it’s not at the national level, but municipal level or regional level — can start checking who is really benefiting from doing these projects in their territories,” Cabello said. “Hopefully some will side more with Indigenous peoples’ rights.”\n\nThough it’s just one tool, Cabello said using UNDRIP like this shows Indigenous communities that denouncing abuse can be met with meaningful recognition — and tells industries that people are watching their work.\n\nSimilarly, the letter that the Sámi council issued to Harvard demanding an end to SCoPEx clarified the risks and violations associated with such a project. Not only is it required to obtain consent for activities on their lands, Indigenous people have the right, the Sámi council reminded the university, to maintain and strengthen their spiritual relationship to their traditional lands, uphold their responsibilities to future generations, and make decisions about the territories and resources under their stewardship, including air.\n\nAfter continued opposition, Harvard’s solar geoengineering project was terminated in March 2024.\n\n“That’s something, because we don’t have many other examples of a huge institution like Harvard backing down after critique from Indigenous peoples,” Blind said, noting that this issue was successfully addressed outside the court of law.\n\n“It is significant to see that it is actually an option to halt something when you realize that it wasn’t done right.”"}

They had not just Japan’s, but the entire world’s best-selling album in 2019, and as further proof of the band’s phenomenal popularity, there was that time a fan stole over 300 pages of magazine articles about the group from a public library.\n\nBut just like every storm eventually dissipates, Arashi’s time is coming to an end, with the group announcing that it is officially disbanding.\n\nThe announcement, made through the group’s official Twitter account on Tuesday, might come as a surprise both to hard-core Arashi fans and casual J-pop followers alike, since depending on which group you’re in you may have either been fervently waiting for Arashi to kick its activities into high gear or assuming that they’d already broken up. That’s because a while back Arashi announced that they’d be going on hiatus, but not before a promised flurry of concerts and fan appreciation events. Unfortunately, those events were planned for 2020, with the group scheduled to enter hiatus at the end of that year, and while the coronavirus pandemic led to Arashi’s performances and appearances being cancelled, the hiatus started as scheduled.\n\nThe open-ended nature of the hiatus, combined with the gradual, indistinct ending of the pandemic, left it unclear if Arashi was still just on hiatus, or if this was going to be the understated de-facto end of the group. For everyone who was hoping for Arashi to resume activities, the announcement is bittersweet, with the group saying…\n\n“[We] sincerely regret we were unable to perform for all of you during that last year of activities due to the Coronavirus pandemic. So, in order to finally express our deep gratitude directly to all our fans, the five of us have gathered together once again and have begun planning a concert tour as Arashi to be held next spring”\n\n…but also…\n\n“upon conclusion of this tour, we will end our activities as Arashi”\n\nThe group says they’ve spent the past year and a half looking for ways to restart Arashi’s activity, but that “the environment surrounding us [having] changed, in addition to each of our individually changed circumstances compared to before” made finding solutions difficult, likely alluding to events such as the scandal-tainted collapse of Johnny & Associates, the talent agency Arashi operated under, and the marriages of group members Sho Sakurai and Masaki Aiba.\n\nDetails such as dates and locations for Arashi’s 2026 farewell concerts are yet to be set, but the group says that priority will be given to Arashi fan club members, and also that it is temporarily suspending new membership applications to help ensure ticket supply for existing members. The group says it plans to reopen new fan club applications at a later time, but also that the club will cease operations in May of 2026.\n\n▼ The English-language version of the announcement refers to both a “fan club” and a “family club,” but this appears to be a mistranslation, as the original Japanese-language announcement only mentions the “fan club.”\n\nWe have something the five of us would like to share with you all.\n\n⁡\n\nIt has been almost four and a half years since we went on hiatus, and we sincerely regret we were unable to perform for all of you during that last year of activities due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

Muji, has made a name for itself thanks to its high-quality, reasonably priced…well, everything. The Japanese lifestyle chain offers a staggering variety of products, from housewares and furniture to clothing and appliances, all of which tend to leave customers satisfied and wallets relatively full.\n\nThe Mujirushi catalog is so extensive that the exact product lineup can vary quite a bit from branch to branch, depending on the available amount of floorspace. The bigger the branch, the more unique the offerings, though, and on a recent visit to the largest Mujirushi in Japan, we found some very special pizzas.\n\nMujirushi’s food and beverage division has been looking for ways to shine a spotlight on locally raised produce, and so at certain stores in central and west Japan you can find what it calls “Local Pizzas,” which bear the message “Locally crafted pizza made with locally sourced ingredients.” Since Japan’s biggest Mujirushi is in Nara Prefecture, the star ingredient in their Local Pizzas is Yamatomaru eggplant.\n\nGrown in Nara’s Yamato district, Yamatomaru eggplants are round with dark skin that has a dramatic sheen. They’re noticeably firmer than other varieties of eggplant, with slices retaining their texture and shape even after being grilled, baked, or steamed.\n\nMujirushi has two kinds of frozen Yamatomaru eggplant pizzas, one that also uses teriyaki chicken as a topping and the other that uses anchovies. We picked up one of each (the teriyaki chicken one costing 1,050 yen [US$7.25] and the anchovy 950 yen) and took them back home for taste-testing.\n\nYou can thaw the pizzas either in the fridge or in the microwave, and we opted for the latter, since we’re of the mind that “sooner is better than later” is pretty much always the appropriate philosophy for pizza.\n\nWe decided to try the Yamatomaru eggplant with anchovies version first. Taking the thawed but still uncooked pizza out after its stint in the microwave, we already knew we were going to be in for something good based on how good it looked and smelled even in this intermediary state, with luxuriously thick slices of eggplant stretching all across the top of the pie.\n\nAnd after baking it…\n\n…it looked even better!\n\nThey say that looks can be deceiving, but the operative word there is can. In the case of Mujirushi’s Yamatomaru pizza, the appearance is an honest declaration of how it’s going to taste. The eggplant slices are meaty and juicy, filled with delicious flavor that hits your taste buds the moment you bite into them.\n\nThe crust is outstanding as well, with just the right touch of outer-layer crispiness giving way to an invitingly soft bread texture underneath.\n\nMoving on to the Yamatomaru teriyaki chicken pizza, we were just as impressed, and the extra proteins here make this an even better option if you’re feeling especially hungry.\n\nCurrently, the Yamatomaru eggplant pizza is only available at select Mujirushi branches, listed below:\n\n● Osaka: Aeon Mall Sakai Kita Hanada\n\n● Kyoto: Kyoto Yamashina, Coop Nijo Station, Aeon Mall Kyoto Katsuragawa, Matsui Yamate, Aeon Mall Kumiyama\n\n● Nara: Aeon Mall Yamato Koriyama, Aeon Town Tomio Minami\n\n● Wakayama: Forest Mall Iwade, Supercenter Okuwa Nanki,\n\n● Shiga: Alplaza Kusatsu\n\n● Hiroshima: Alpark Hiroshima\n\nThe “local” focus of the Local Pizzas mean that Mujirushi probably won’t be expanding the Yamatomaru eggplants ones’ availability all that widely or swiftly, but it’s definitely worth trying if you get a chance, and with how delicious they are, we’ll be keeping our eyes out for what sort of Local Pizzas might grace Mujirushi branches in other parts of Japan.\n\nReference: Mujirushi\n\nYamatomaru photo: Wikipedia/Uo3rt\n\nAll other photos © SoraNews24\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

During an appearance on “Hannity,” Hanson said Biden didn’t just fail to secure the southern border, he dismantled the very idea of it.\n\n“The biggest question, Sean, is it was so egregious, so surreal, that nobody knows why Biden did it. Was it to get new voters through early voting and mail-in voting? Was it to get a welfare constituency and rule government?” Hanson asked about Biden’s intention on opening the border. “Was it just sheer nihilism to punish half the country? Did he not believe in borders? It was so bizarre that no one can even figure out [why] anybody would want to do such damage to their own country. It’s gonna take two generations to solve this problem, and he left it. It’s the worst thing anybody’s ever done in that White House.”\n\nHanson argued that Biden’s immigration policies weren’t just reckless, they were deliberately destructive.\n\nWATCH:\n\n“I think historians are gonna look back and see this as the worst thing that any president has done in the last 50 years. It was a deliberate effort to destroy the border and allow 12 million people to come in. The first thing they did was break the law when they crossed it,” Hanson said. “The second thing they did was reside here illegally, and then they enjoyed preferential treatment.”\n\nHanson pointed to the two-tiered treatment illegal immigrants received under the Biden administration and said they often avoided vaccine mandates and real ID requirements that applied to American citizens.\n\n“They didn’t have to have a real ID to get on a plane in some cases. They didn’t have to have a COVID vaccination, and that inculcated a sense of entitlement, and they had no fear but actually contempt for law enforcement,” Hanson said.\n\nIn its first 100 days, the Trump administration said it had sweeping success on immigration enforcement, both at the border and in the interior. A White House report, shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation, said daily border encounters dropped by 93%, and illegal crossings fell by nearly 100%. (RELATED: Washington State Bill Paves The Way For More Non-Citizen Voting, Critics Say)\n\nDuring that time, authorities detained over 151,000 illegal immigrants and deported more than 135,000, including gang members from MS-13 and Tren de Aragua. The administration also scrapped the Biden-era CBP One app, which had allowed migrants to flood the asylum system by requesting appointments online — a system used more than 160 million times over two years.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

On “The Megyn Kelly Show,” the SiriusXM host pointed to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon’s announcement that Harvard would no longer be eligible for new grants, asking Roberts for his reaction, given his background as a former college president.\n\n“Well, first of all, let me start with that letter from Secretary McMahon, who, by the way, like every other cabinet secretary, is doing such a great job. It was hot fire,” Roberts said. “It’s so righteous on behalf of common sense toward an institution, Harvard, that used to be the pride and joy of this country, even for those of us who didn’t go there and never really wanted to. Instead, what Harvard has become is sort of the icon, the avatar for the radical left.”\n\n“Having been a college president, Megyn, I will tell you that if I had been the president of Harvard and was receiving these missives from Donald Trump, I would have picked up the phone and said, ‘Mr. President, can I come meet with you for half an hour? Let’s talk about our shared goal, which is that we love this country,'” Roberts added. “‘We want to educate students. When we receive public money, we want to really treasure it and actually further science, further study, further American values.’ But he could not do that because Harvard doesn’t believe in those things.”\n\nWATCH:\n\n\n\nIn a letter sent to Harvard on Monday, McMahon accused the university of a “systemic pattern of violating federal law,” saying it is no longer eligible for future federal funding. She added that the school has “failed to abide” by the U.S. Supreme Court’s order to “end its racial preferencing” and continues to “engage in ugly racism in its undergraduate and graduate school.” (RELATED: GOP Reps Propose Taxing Colleges’ Colossal Endowment Revenue In Trump-Backed Bill)\n\nRoberts said he supports the administration’s pushback against universities like Harvard, saying the school’s academic standards are declining as it prioritizes progressive social issues.\n\n“So the gig is up. Those of us — whether like me, an educator or you, a very smart observer in journalism and news — understand that the Ivy Leagues and most four-year universities in this country have been using the public’s money against us by implementing all this DEI nonsense,” Roberts said.\n\n“To say nothing of the very steady decline in educational attainment we’ve seen with four-year and six-year graduation rates,” Roberts said. “So of all the things I’m excited about that this administration has done in its first few months, it is this effort on education broadly, but on Harvard in particular, that I would put at the top of my list.”\n\nIn April, Harvard sued the Trump administration, claiming it was using the withholding of federal funding as “leverage to gain control over academic-decision making” at the Ivy League. Harvard said it would not allow itself to be “taken over by the federal government.”\n\nThe Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism said on April 14 it would revoke $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 million in contract value from the university.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

During an appearance on “Kudlow,” Burgum said that U.S. energy shortfalls could allow China to outpace America in artificial intelligence and other power-hungry technologies.\n\n“The real energy emergency that we have right now is that we don’t have enough energy in this country. We’re losing the AI arms race to China, and we’ve got to have more energy and more power right now in the country. And so that’s one of the things that we’re focused on right now,” Burgum told host Larry Kudlow.\n\nBurgum blasted California’s aggressive emissions standards, which he said have effectively become national policy.\n\nWATCH:\n\n“Let’s start with California, Larry. That would be a great idea, because there’s 14 other states that followed California. So basically we’re stuck right now. Automakers feel like they’ve got to build two kinds of cars in America, one for California standards and one for the rest of the country,” Burgum said. “Of course, we know that the California standards are based on a bunch of falsehoods around emissions, because if we want zero carbon fuels, it’s much cheaper.”\n\nBurgum took particular aim at electric vehicle subsidies, calling them a boondoggle built on climate ideology. He also called electric vehicle subsidies economically reckless since the cost of avoiding a single ton of carbon dioxide exceeds $900. (RELATED: Supreme Court Case Could Spell The End For California’s EV Mandate)\n\n“It’s 10 to 15 times cheaper to have zero carbon liquid fuels than it is to subsidize EVs. The EV subsidies, where the real bank was, the thing that was really breaking the bank, over $900 for an avoided tonus of CO2, and all of that built around climate ideology,” Burgum said.\n\nRepublican Pennsylvania Rep. John Joyce introduced a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to stop California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate, which several other states have adopted. If the Senate doesn’t act, the Environmental Protection Agency would face a lengthy rulemaking process to reverse the policy that will allow California’s stricter standards to remain in effect for years.\n\nThe states that have opted in to California’s auto rules include Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

While discussing whether Democrats could gain ground in the 2026 midterm elections on “The Five,” Gutfeld said that, regardless of whether they win seats, the real question is whether voters “believe anything” Democrats say.\n\n“Usually the outside party does. It’s a question of whether anybody’s going to believe anything you say, because everything you said the last four years was a lie. Not you. I’m just talking about primarily Joe Biden,” Gutfeld said, referring to co-host and Democrat strategist Jessica Tarlov.\n\n“Look, what is the usual answer, Jesse, when someone says, ‘Why don’t they like me?’ Usually the answer is, ‘Well, you’re a selfish prick.’ And the answer is, ‘I’m not selfish. I do all sorts of things. I help people.’ It’s like, no, no, no. That’s exactly my point. You do those things as a virtue signal to give you permission to exploit people,” Gutfeld added. “People are suddenly realizing that’s what the Democratic Party was.”\n\nWATCH:\n\n\n\nIn attempts to appeal to males, Harris’ campaign released a 90-second video showing a group of men repeatedly declaring they were “man enough” to support women’s rights and not be “afraid of women.” Additionally, the former vice president rolled out a proposal called the “Opportunity Agenda for Black Men,” which offered one million $20,000 loans to black entrepreneurs and “others who have historically faced barriers to starting a new business or growing an existing business.” RELATED: Bernie Sanders Says Dems Too Focused On ‘Resisting’ Trump At Expense Of Helping Working Class\n\n“All the virtues that they expressed were designed for their primary engine, which is the self. How can I elevate my status? How could I end up at the Met Gala? It’s all about that. I mentioned this word before,” Gutfeld said. “It’s an orientation problem. The Democratic Party is a party that doesn’t look up or out. It looks around, and it looks inward. They look around to see what others have and that status seeking, and it drives envy. Identity politics plays into that. They look inward.”\n\n“Again, they see everything through the hierarchy of identity. Then suddenly everything becomes transactional. What do I get out of this? Why do they get this? Trump smashed that thing to bits,” Gutfeld said. “But it is kind of incredible to see that change. Especially the younger people. The younger people. It’s all because they’ve lost the sunk cost of identity, that this bag of rocks that they carry around wherever they go, they’re free to bond over ideas. And I would say to the Democrats, you’ve got to take a page out of the Republican playbook.”\n\nDespite the party’s attempts throughout the 2024 campaign, Trump ended up gaining ground among black and Latino men. According to Reuters, the president gained 14 points among Hispanics nationally since 2020, and saw gains among black men in swing states like North Carolina.\n\nSince the election, Democrats have struggled to regain movement behind a single party leader and message, dropping to a record low of 29% in their favorability, according to a CNN/SSRS poll released in March.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Byron Donalds called for a major overhaul of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Fox Business Tuesday.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday defended President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda and backed major staffing cuts at her agency during her first hearing before Congress. During an appearance on “The Bottom Line,” Donalds blasted FEMA’s bureaucratic delays and suggested a way to fix the agency.\n\n“Well, I think that what needs to happen is you got to get it out of Homeland Security,” Donalds said. “That’s why I filed the bill with Jared Moskowitz out of Florida to do just that. Get it out of Homeland and out of that bureaucracy. Have it be a direct report agency to the White House. So the president working with the governor in that particular state can get real-time decisions occurring so people can get back on their feet.”\n\nDonalds didn’t hold back in his critique of FEMA’s track record and cited unresolved claims from hurricanes as far back as Katrina. He said states like North Carolina and Florida still struggle with disaster recovery efforts long after the storms passed.\n\n“Look, FEMA’s failures have been reported on for, frankly, over a decade. The secretary said Katrina claims are still outstanding. I can tell you Hurricane Ian claims are still outstanding. And we haven’t even gotten to Helene and Milton from last year,” Donalds said. “North Carolina still has a lot of recovery work to do. Obviously, Florida is still doing recovery work. A lot of this disaster recovery really falls on governors.”\n\nWATCH:\n\nThe Florida congressman praised Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for leading the recovery in the Sunshine State but warned that FEMA’s inefficiency hampers even the most competent state-level responses.\n\n“Governor DeSantis in our state has done a tremendous job with that. Other governors, not so much. But FEMA needs to be an action agency, not the bureaucratic agency it has become. It needs real reforms. So, to quote the secretary, as it exists today, FEMA needs to end,” Donalds said. “This is why the president and his team are going through the process of reforming FEMA, creating a new agency that can be responsive to the American people.”\n\nIn March, the Trump administration began moving to reform FEMA and shift more disaster response authority to states. Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to prioritize state-level preparedness and abandon the broad “all-hazards” approach. Trump slammed FEMA as “a disaster” and “a very big disappointment” during remarks at Asheville Regional Airport in January before touring Hurricane Helene recovery zones in North Carolina.\n\nFEMA faced widespread backlash after Hurricanes Helene and Milton struck the Southeast, as reports emerged that some agency staff were instructed to avoid aiding homes with pro-Trump signs. Marn’i Washington, a former FEMA crew leader, was fired in November for allegedly telling employees to “avoid homes advertising Trump” while assisting Florida residents hit by Hurricane Milton. (RELATED: ‘We Need To Do Better’: Vance Torches FEMA For Hamstringing Local Hurricane Recovery Efforts)\n\nCritics also blasted FEMA for poor disaster preparedness, with the agency failing to answer nearly half of the 900,000 calls it received from survivors just days after Milton made landfall. While struggling to meet demand for aid, FEMA spent millions on services for illegal migrants and launched a grant program aimed at boosting “equity” in disaster responses. In response, the Trump administration began a major overhaul of the agency, firing four FEMA employees in February and scrubbing terms like climate change and DEI from official documents.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The early response was not positive, with shares down 2.6% to AU$31.81 in the past week. Westpac Banking missed revenue estimates by 2.2%, coming in atAU$11b, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.96 beat expectations, coming in 3.2% ahead of analyst estimates. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nASX:WBC Earnings and Revenue Growth May 7th 2025\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Westpac Banking from 13 analysts is for revenues of AU$22.0b in 2025. If met, it would imply a credible 3.0% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to dip 3.2% to AU$1.97 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of AU$22.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$1.98 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nView our latest analysis for Westpac Banking\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at AU$28.57. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Westpac Banking, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at AU$36.00 and the most bearish at AU$26.50 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\n\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The analysts are definitely expecting Westpac Banking's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 6.1% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.7% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 4.4% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Westpac Banking is expected to grow much faster than its industry."}

The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nXTRA:NEM Earnings and Revenue History May 7th 2025\n\nExamining Cashflow Against Nemetschek's Earnings\n\nAs finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\n\nThat means a negative accrual ratio is a good thing, because it shows that the company is bringing in more free cash flow than its profit would suggest. While having an accrual ratio above zero is of little concern, we do think it's worth noting when a company has a relatively high accrual ratio. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nNemetschek has an accrual ratio of -0.21 for the year to March 2025. Therefore, its statutory earnings were very significantly less than its free cashflow. In fact, it had free cash flow of €350m in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of €177.8m. Nemetschek's free cash flow improved over the last year, which is generally good to see.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Nemetschek's Profit Performance\n\nAs we discussed above, Nemetschek's accrual ratio indicates strong conversion of profit to free cash flow, which is a positive for the company. Because of this, we think Nemetschek's underlying earnings potential is as good as, or possibly even better, than the statutory profit makes it seem! And the EPS is up 20% annually, over the last three years. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. Ultimately, this article has formed an opinion based on historical data. However, it can also be great to think about what analysts are forecasting for the future.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand BT Group plc (LON:BT.A).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for BT Group is:\n\n6.1% = UK£766m ÷ UK£13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each £1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made £0.06 in profit.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for BT Group\n\nDoes BT Group Have A Good ROE?\n\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, BT Group has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Telecom industry.\n\nLSE:BT.A Return on Equity May 7th 2025\n\nUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for BT Group by visiting our risks dashboard for free on our platform here.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nCombining BT Group's Debt And Its 6.1% Return On Equity\n\nBT Group clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.51. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."}

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns.

The formula for this calculation on M&C Saatchi is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.35 = UK£34m ÷ (UK£236m - UK£139m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nSo, M&C Saatchi has an ROCE of 35%.

More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 2,007% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.\n\nOn a side note, M&C Saatchi's current liabilities are still rather high at 59% of total assets. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks."}

The Mountain View-based tech giant began shipping the feature, dubbed Simplify, starting Tuesday. Powered by Gemini AI models, the feature lets users highlight the desired text to get an AI-generated rewrite that breaks down complex language, jargon, and subject area-specific technical terms. Simplify was developed by Google Research, and a technical paper detailing the process has been published by the company.\n\nGoogle App Can Now Simplify Text on iPhone Devices\n\nIn a blog post, the tech giant detailed the new feature rolling out to iOS users. This is a phased rollout, so it might take up to a few days before all Google app for iOS users get access to the AI feature.\n\nGoogle says the AI tool can be useful when a user is trying to learn about a new topic and is struggling to understand the text due to niche terms and jargon used. Once they have access to the feature, they can just highlight the particular block of text, and the AI will automatically rewrite it in a simple-to-understand language.\n\nAfter highlighting desired text, Simplify will appear at the bottom of the screen within the “More actions” panel. It will be available as the first option on the right side. The feature's icon is the letter ‘A' and two curved arrows surrounding it. Tapping on this icon will activate the feature.\n\nNotably, Simplify generates the rewritten text on the same page, so users do not have to leave the article or research paper to understand the meaning of the complex text. Developed by Google Research, the tool is powered by the Gemini 1.5 Pro AI model.\n\nIn a technical paper, Google researchers highlighted that the AI tool was developed with a special focus on fidelity assessment. They ensured that the meaning of the original text is retained and errors such as loss of information, adding unrelated words, and distortion of the meaning behind the sentences are identified and corrected before the final output is generated."}

By 2026, the company plans to introduce a foldable iPhone, implement a split release schedule, and unveil new advancements in design and technology. These strategic initiatives aim to maintain Apple’s leadership in innovation while addressing the diverse and evolving needs of its global audience. The video below from MacRumors gives us more dteails on what to expect.\n\nSplit Release Schedule: Sustaining Consumer Engagement Year-Round\n\nApple is set to adopt a staggered release schedule for its iPhones starting in 2026, marking a departure from its traditional annual fall launches. Under this new strategy, high-end models such as the iPhone 18 Pro, Pro Max, Air, and the highly anticipated foldable iPhone will debut in the fall. Meanwhile, the standard iPhone 18 and an updated iPhone 16e are slated for release in spring 2027.\n\nThis approach mirrors strategies employed by competitors like Samsung, making sure a steady stream of product launches to sustain consumer interest throughout the year. For you, this means more frequent opportunities to explore devices tailored to a variety of preferences, needs, and budgets. By diversifying its release schedule, Apple aims to keep its products relevant and maintain a competitive edge in the fast-paced smartphone market.\n\nFoldable iPhone: A New Era in Smartphone Design\n\nOne of the most anticipated developments in Apple’s roadmap is the launch of its first foldable iPhone, expected in fall 2026. This device is designed to set a new standard in foldable smartphone technology, combining innovation with practicality. Key features include:\n\nA 7.8-inch inner display with a nearly invisible crease, offering a seamless and immersive viewing experience.\n\nA 5.5-inch outer display for convenient use when the device is folded.\n\nA robust titanium and stainless steel hinge, engineered for durability and longevity.\n\nAn ultra-thin design, measuring just 4.5 mm when unfolded, making sure portability without compromising functionality.\n\nDual rear cameras, a high-density battery for extended usage, and a Touch ID power button for enhanced security.\n\nFor those drawn to innovative technology and sleek functionality, this foldable iPhone represents a significant leap forward. Its innovative design and advanced features aim to redefine how you interact with your smartphone, blending versatility with elegance.\n\nFuture Innovations: Enhancing the User Experience\n\nApple’s vision extends well beyond 2026, with rumors of fantastic features in the pipeline. By 2027, the iPhone 19 Air is expected to feature a larger display, potentially exceeding 6.9 inches, catering to users who prioritize screen size for productivity or entertainment. Additionally, the Pro models in the iPhone 19 lineup could introduce:\n\nA true edge-to-edge display, eliminating bezels entirely for a more immersive visual experience.\n\nUnder-screen Face ID and a hidden front camera, achieving a seamless and uninterrupted design.\n\nBefore these advancements, the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max are anticipated to feature under-screen Face ID with a small pinhole for the front camera, marking a gradual transition toward an all-screen design. These innovations reflect Apple’s commitment to creating devices that not only meet but exceed user expectations, offering a blend of functionality and aesthetic appeal.\n\nManufacturing Diversification: Strengthening the Supply Chain\n\nIn response to global challenges, Apple is actively working to diversify its manufacturing operations. The company plans to expand production trials in India, reducing its reliance on Chinese facilities. This strategic shift aims to create a more resilient supply chain, potentially minimizing delays in product availability and making sure a steady flow of devices to meet consumer demand.\n\nFor you, this diversification could translate into improved product availability and reduced wait times for new releases. Apple’s efforts align with a broader industry trend of mitigating geopolitical and logistical risks, making sure stability in an increasingly interconnected global market.\n\n20th Anniversary iPhone: A Milestone in Innovation\n\nApple is expected to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the iPhone in 2027 with a special edition model. This commemorative device is rumored to feature a fully immersive display, integrating all sensors beneath the screen and eliminating bezels entirely. Such a design would represent the culmination of Apple’s efforts to push the boundaries of smartphone technology.\n\nThis milestone device is likely to serve as a testament to Apple’s enduring commitment to innovation and its ability to adapt to changing technological landscapes. For you, it offers a glimpse into the future of mobile technology, where functionality and design converge seamlessly.\n\nShaping the Future of Smartphones\n\nApple’s upcoming plans signal a bold evolution in its iPhone lineup.

But another handheld, the Asus ROG Ally 2, a powerful rival to Valve's Steam Deck and pseudo Xbox handheld, may finally be making its long-awaited appearance with some big hardware improvements.\n\nAccording to 91mobiles (via Videocardz), two models of the Asus ROG Ally 2 are set to launch in a matter of weeks, featuring minor design improvements and more significant hardware upgrades to what is already a top pick from our guide to the best handheld consoles. The black model also reportedly features a dedicated Xbox button, which could hint towards a partnership with Microsoft for the new gaming handheld.\n\nThere are some slight hardware differences between the black and white Ally 2 models as well. The black model will allegedly feature an AMD Z2 Extreme CPU with eight cores, alongside 64GB LPDDR5-8533 of memory. The white model will reportedly feature an AMD AERITH Plus CPU with four cores. Both models are also expected to feature a 120Hz display, beating the 90Hz display on the Steam Deck OLED.\n\nThese specs, if true, leapfrog Valve's handheld massively thanks to the display and CPU improvements, potentially making some of the best Steam games shine on the ROG Ally 2. They could also make the gaming handheld a great way to play demanding games like GTA 6 on the go if it ever arrives on PC.\n\nIn our review of the ROG Ally X, we mentioned how gorgeous the design and the display were, cementing it as one of the best Steam Deck alternatives. Although no release date was mentioned, we could see a ROG Ally 2 reveal at Computex later this month, given that the PC hardware trade show heralded the launch of the ROG Ally X last year.\n\nAs someone who swapped his gaming PC for a Steam Deck in 2022, as well as pre-ordering the Switch 2 in April, the ROG Ally 2 makes me curious. Realistically, there simply won't be every game available to play on the Switch 2, but PC gaming handhelds like the Ally 2 let me tinker with some to work on them, such as Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire or the PC version of Onimusha 3. With my Steam Deck almost three years old, I may wait to see how big of an upgrade the Ally 2 is and whether its improvements justify replacing my PC handheld.\n\nFor more of the latest mobile hardware news, follow us on Google News to stay in the loop, or, if you're looking for something new to game on, check out our guides to the best gaming tablets and the best gaming phones."}

They sell them directly on their own website, which is how most people buy it. They also sell them on their new Amazon Store. They used to have distribution at Walmart, but that partnership ended a couple of years ago and before that they had an agreement with Boarders Books, until that company went bankrupt. We reported a couple of days ago that the Kobo Clara Colour and Kobo Sage were out of stock. Is Kobo abandoning the US market because Amazon is too hard to compete against?\n\nThe Kobo Clara Colour is not available on the United States website for Kobo, it is completely sold out and is not going to be available until sometime this summer. The Sage is completely unavailable and is likely discontinued. However, all of their current generation e-readers are available in other countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom. The Kobo Amazon Store also has all of their e-readers in stock in multiple countries.\n\nKobo does not have any distribution anymore in the United States, when it comes to brick-and-mortar stores. They do have agreements with bookstores all over the world, such as Chapters Indigo in Canada, FNAC in France, Argos and Currys in the United Kingdom and other retailers all over Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Kobo has a huge distribution site where you can view every country that they operate in.\n\nThe United States market is one of the most powerful in the world and this is the one country where Kobo has a hard time finding a long term partner. Barnes and Noble sells the NOOK in over 600 bookstores, Amazon had distribution through Target, Best Buy and their own e-commerce platform. This doesn’t leave many other partners that Kobo can sell directly in-store. They just sell through Amazon, but the average customer can’t walk into a store and try before they buy.\n\nIt looks like there are three things happening with the US version of the Kobo website. They are legit out of stock in lots of items and will do another production run sometime soon, they are abandoning the market altogether or are going to be releasing new e-readers late summer or fall.\n\nMichael Kozlowski Michael Kozlowski is the editor-in-chief at Good e-Reader and has written about audiobooks and e-readers for the past fifteen years.

In this model each vertex of the square lattice enforces the “ice rule” in which the direction of flow of two channels point into and two channels point out of every node. There are six different flow configurations for this rule. ×\n\nActive fluids—collections of self-propelled agents such as bacteria, cells, or colloids—consume energy to move, flowing without being pushed [1]. These materials break the conventional rules of fluid dynamics, as they can flow spontaneously, switch direction without apparent cause, and organize into complex patterns with no external control. Active fluids were initially studied to understand the collective dynamics observed in biological systems. Now they offer a rich playground for exploring nonequilibrium physics. Yet, in the ever-expanding universe of active-fluid physics, it is rare to find an experimental system that maps precisely onto a mathematically exact model. Now Camille Jorge and Denis Bartolo from the University of Lyon, France, demonstrate that the flows of an active fluid confined in a two-dimensional square lattice of microchannels realize the six-vertex model from statistical mechanics—one of the earliest and most elegant examples of an exactly solvable model for interacting particles in a lattice [2]. This discovery is remarkable not just for the elegance of the mapping but also for what it reveals: a nonequilibrium fluid behaving exactly as predicted by a theoretical model devised to describe a completely different system (water ice with a disordered proton distribution). The finding could aid in the control and design of complex materials.\n\nIn unconfined environments, active fluids often exhibit chaotic and unpredictable motion, with swirls, jets, and spontaneous symmetry breaking that defy conventional control. To tame this complexity, researchers can turn to geometric confinement of the fluid, shaping the boundaries—whether through plates, posts, or junctions—with which the fluid interacts in order to manipulate local interactions among the fluid constituents and impose global order [1]. This approach has led to the manipulation of turbulent flow patterns [3] and revealed unexpected scaling laws [4], transforming active fluids into tunable platforms for exploring collective dynamics under constraint.\n\nThe six-vertex model, also known as the ice model, was introduced in the 1930s to account for the peculiar entropy of frozen water [5]. Each vertex of the model’s square lattice enforces the “ice rule”: Two arrows must point into every node and two must point out of every node. Although the model failed to fully explain the behavior of ice, it became a cornerstone in the field of integrable systems and found application in magnetism, ferroelectrics, and quantum spin chains. Yet, for all its theoretical triumphs, the model remained abstract—until now.\n\nC. Jorge and D. Bartolo [ 2 Video 1: The flows of an active colloidal fluid self-organize in a square lattice made of identical channels.\n\nAt the core of the new experiment is a two-dimensional lattice of microchannels filled with colloidal rollers—micrometer-sized particles that, when subjected to an electric field, will roll along a surface. These particles spontaneously generate flow in the surrounding fluid, and when confined to a square network, the resulting currents at each junction obey local mass conservation: Two channels have currents that flow in and two have currents that flow out—just like the ice rule (Fig. 1).\n\nBy introducing cylindrical posts at the junctions, Jorge and Bartolo were able to tweak the relative frequency of the flow patterns—which channels have currents that flow in, and which channels have currents that flow out—of a vertex, effectively tuning the statistical weights of the model and driving the system through a phase transition from a disordered to an ordered state. This transition mirrors the disordered-to-antiferroelectric ordering predicted by the six-vertex model’s phase diagram. As the posts grew larger, they suppressed certain flow configurations and promoted others, causing the system to develop alternating flow patterns across the lattice. To understand what was happening, Jorge and Bartolo tracked so-called Lagrangian particle trajectories and reconstructed the entire flow network, showing that the ensemble of loops formed by the moving particles matched the predictions of another statistical model, the completely packed loop model, which is exactly equivalent to the six-vertex model.\n\nThe agreement between theory and experiment is unusually good. The loop size distributions, the fractal dimensions of the trajectories, and the spatial correlations between two points on a loop all match analytic predictions, including conformal-field-theory results. Large loops exhibit a fractal dimension of 7/4, characteristic of percolation, while smaller ones have a fractal dimension of 4/3, consistent with “self-avoiding” walks. Such quantitative alignment is rare in active fluids, where theoretical mapping often requires major approximations. Here, the experimental system is the model, transforming the active fluid into a solver for statistical mechanics problems. The agreement between theory and experiment also demonstrates that nonequilibrium systems can exactly mimic the behavior of equilibrium models, not just in spirit but in detail, and it offers a new tool for studying the six-vertex model—instead of simulating the six-vertex model computationally, researchers can now implement it physically, tuning parameters with microfluidic design rather than code.\n\nThis work also opens other avenues for theory and experiment. On the theoretical side, it invites extensions of the hydraulic rules and their mappings to statistical models in systems with higher coordination numbers or with three-dimensional geometries. On the experimental side, future studies could test whether similar hydraulic rules apply to other classes of active fluids and examine how far the mapping to statistical models can be pushed. Beyond geometry, intrinsic properties of the ambient medium—such as viscoelasticity—may fundamentally alter the hydraulic rules and lead to new emergent phenomena [6].\n\nMore broadly, this work will inspire physicists to rethink the role of geometry and activity in material design. Just as colloid systems became playgrounds for probing the microscopic dynamics of phase transitions [7], active fluids could serve as experimental platforms for classical and statistical field theories. The idea that one can “draw” a flow pattern by sculpting microchannel geometries—and have it follow exact theoretical predictions—is powerful. It also holds promise for disciplines far beyond soft matter, from microfluidic computing and robotics to developmental biology and the physics of living systems [8]. In a broader sense, this study reminds us that even the most abstract theories can find vivid manifestations in the physical world, if we look creatively enough.\n\nAbout the Author Yi Peng is an associate professor at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he heads an interdisciplinary group researching the collective dynamics of active matter and phase transitions in colloidal crystals.

In recent years, the esteemed prize—handed out annually at the World Science Fiction Society convention, also known as Worldcon, whose members vote on the honorees—has weathered its share of controversies, with negative headlines (take your pick: geographical censorship; racism; ties to defense manufacturers; anti-“woke” backlash before anti-“woke” was even a thing) sometimes getting more attention than the books and other media the Hugos aim to celebrate.\n\nAs io9 previously reported, this year’s flashpoint is the use of ChatGPT—but fortunately, not in a way that has any impact on the actual Hugo Awards. The Hugo ceremony is just one part of August’s Seattle Worldcon 2025; it’s also a convention that hosts panels featuring authors and other sci-fi and fantasy luminaries. Within the past two weeks, it was discovered that ChatGPT had been used to help vet program participants; three people involved, including two Hugo administrators, resigned as a result, and Seattle Worldcon 2025 chair Kathy Bond issued first a statement on the issue, followed by a separate apology.\n\nHowever, the issue is still rankling sci-fi and fantasy fans on social media, not to mention would-be Hugos honorees; as blog File 770 reported, author Yoon Ha Lee went so far as to remove his novel Moonstorm from Hugo consideration (it had been nominated for the Lodestar Award honoring YA works). Yesterday, Bond posted a third message about the controversy, with an additional statement from program division head SunnyJim Morgan.\n\nBond’s portion reiterates how ChatGPT was used, with details and specifics. Of particular note, it was not used for “creating the Hugo Award Finalist list or announcement video” or “administering the process for Hugo Award nominations.” She also includes a renewed apology not just about the use of AI, but the way she initially responded to concerns by releasing a “flawed statement” when the issue was first brought to light.\n\nShe also says that “we are redoing the part of our program process that used ChatGPT, with that work being performed by new volunteers from outside our current team” and pledges that Worldcon—whose staff is all-volunteer, she notes—will do all it can to regain the community’s trust moving forward.\n\nTo that end, Morgan’s statement is also both apology and even deeper dive into how ChatGPT was used, including the actual prompt used to vet potential program participants:\n\nREQUEST\n\nUsing the list of names provided, please evaluate each person for scandals. Scandals include but are not limited to homophobia, transphobia, racism, harassment, sexual misconduct, sexism, fraud.\n\nEach person is typically an author, editor, performer, artist or similar in the fields of science fiction, fantasy, and or related fandoms.\n\nThe objective is to determine if an individual is unsuitable as a panelist for an event.\n\nPlease evaluate each person based on their digital footprint, including social, articles, and blogs referencing them. Also include file770.com as a source.\n\nProvide sources for any relevant data.\n\nMorgan reports that his team “did not simply accept the results that were returned” as a result of ChatGPT’s vetting. “Instead, links to primary content returned during vetting were reviewed by our team and myself before a final decision whether to invite the person was made. Ultimately, this process led to fewer than five people being disqualified from receiving an invitation to participate in the program due to information previously unknown.”\n\nRead the full statements from Bond and Morgan here; Bond writes that Seattle Worldcon’s next update will come May 13, so it’ll be interesting to see if there’s more coming on the ChatGPT issue, or if the organizers will be moving forward from this point.\n\nWhat do you think of this latest olive branch—and do you think Worldcon is handling its latest dust-up effectively? Let us know in the comments."}
