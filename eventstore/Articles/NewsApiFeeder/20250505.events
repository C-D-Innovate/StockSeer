Company spokesperson Alex McQuiston confirmed to The Verge that the pilot is taking place in India, France, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.\n\n“We’re experimenting with new ways to provide greater flexibility and value to our YouTube Premium subscribers, including offering a two-person Premium plan option, allowing two people to share a subscription at a reduced cost,” according to McQuiston.\n\nMoneycontrol and Android Authority both include screenshots in their articles of how the two-person plan slots into YouTube’s pricing tiers in Indian rupees. While an individual plan starts at ₹‎140.00 per month, a two-person plan costs ₹‎219.00 per month and a family plan costs ₹‎299.00 per month, so a two-person plan falls right in the middle.\n\nThe pilot of a two-person plan follows YouTube’s wide rollout of YouTube Premium Lite, which the company had also tested in limited countries. Premium Lite plan lets you watch most videos without ads but doesn’t have ad-free music videos, offline downloads, or background play."}

He provided one method for doing this but omitted discussing an older, simpler method that almost accomplishes the same thing.\n\nHow To Find Articles By Older Published Date\n\nThe person asking the question understood how to find articles published from the previous year, month, and twenty four hours. But didn’t know how to find articles published before a specific date.\n\nThe post on Bluesky asked:\n\n“Is there a way to search for articles OLDER than a certain date? I know advanced search can guarantee in the past year, month, 24h, but I want to specifically be able to find articles published BEFORE X historical event happened, and I can’t find a way to filter. Help?”\n\nSearch Liaison posted this way to do it which can be difficult to memorize if you’re a busy person:\n\n“We have before: and after: operators that are still in beta. You must provide year-month-day dates or only a year. You can combine both. For example: [avengers endgame before:2019]\n\n[avengers endgame after:2019-04-01]\n\n[avengers endgame after:2019-03-01 before:2019-03-05]”\n\nAnother Way To Do Time-Based Search\n\nIn my opinion it’s a lot easier to just use Google’s search tools:\n\nTools > Any Time > Custom Range\n\nFrom there you just set whatever time range that you want, nothing to memorize. However, you can’t search before a certain date, you have to set the starting date and ending date you’re searching for.\n\nCaveat About Time-Based Search\n\nSearch Liaison shared an interesting insight about how the advanced search operators for time work:\n\n“Just keep in mind it can be difficult for us to know the exact date of a document for a variety of reasons. There’s no standard way that all site owners use to indicate a publishing or republishing date. Some provide no dates at all on web pages. Some might not indicate if an older page is updated.”\n\nRelated: Google: How to Use Search Operators for SEO\n\nTakeaways:\n\nThe time-based advanced search operators are still in beta, which means that Google is testing to see how many people find it useful. Google might at some time in the future remove the search operators if it’s not popular or useful.\n\nThe other takeaway is that it’s hard for Google to know the exact date that a document is published.\n\nRead the discussion on Bluesky."}

Brook Lynn (Amanda Setton) is hiding from Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) that she gave birth to their child years ago. Lois (Rena Sofer) refuses to tell them both that the child in question is Gio (Giovanni Mazza), who is also in the dark about the family tie. Josslyn (Eden McCoy) hasn’t told any of her loved ones that she’s in the WSB, and in turn, Jack (Chris McKenna) hasn’t shared with Carly (Laura Wright) that he recruited her daughter. The list truly does go on.\n\nNow the one secret we’re going to zero in on is the one about Kristina (Kate Mansi) attempting to kill Ava (Maura West). Weeks ago, Kristina thought she was cutting the brakes to Ava’s car, but mistakenly cut the brakes to Ric’s (Rick Hearst) vehicle instead.\n\nThis, of course, led to Ric’s car crash that nearly cost him his life and that of Elizabeth’s (Rebecca Herbst). In the aftermath, Kristina has felt remorseful, but has remained quiet, thinking she’s getting away with attempted murder and not wanting to destroy her relationship with Molly (Kristen Vaganos). Kristina has no idea she should be thanking Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) for her continued freedom and newly healed relationship with her sister.\n\nNancy Lee Grahn, General Hospital (Image credit: Disney/Christine Bartolucci)\n\nSince Ava was able to get footage of Kristina in the parking garage the night of the car crash and has the car itself, Ava has been blackmailing Alexis to maintain her silence. The evidence the art gallery owner has could lead to Kristina’s arrest, and Alexis, being a protective mother, doesn’t want to see that happen. So, the attorney has been embezzling money from the Cassadine Estate to pay Ava hush money.\n\nHaving said all of that, Kristina is bound to find out the lengths her mother is going to in order to protect her. This revelation could happen thanks to a conversation Kristina overhears between Alexis and Ava or Alexis and Diane (Carolyn Hennesy), or Kristina could learn of this blackmail secret by some other means. Regardless of how she learns, we venture to say she’s bound to be stunned.\n\nMaura West, General Hospital (Image credit: Disney)\n\nWith the truth, we imagine Kristina is bound to do one of two things. If she sticks to type, then she’s going to explode. Ironically, this could lead to another heated confrontation with Ava, as Kristina likely wouldn’t care for Ava blackmailing her mother. Would Kristina then attempt to finish what she started, and make another attempt on Ava’s life, feeling it’s the only way to deal with Ava once and for all?\n\nThere’s also a chance that Kristina will shock us, and when she learns of Ava’s blackmail, she voluntarily decides to check herself into the mental health facility. While a move like this could ultimately mean Kristina stands trial for her crimes, we’d venture to say she has a chance of not going to prison due to a not guilty plea by reason of insanity. But even if she escapes prison, that may not spare Kristina the wrath of Molly.\n\nGet the What to Watch Newsletter The latest updates, reviews and unmissable series to watch and more!

Unfortunately, it's not as simple as going to your favorite retailer and adding one to your cart. The demand for the console has vastly exceeded the supply.\n\nNintendo will offer some pre-orders directly, but there are some requirements you must meet — and even then, you'll only have a chance to get one based on luck.\n\nInvites have started going out today, May 8, for those who have registered interest and meet all of Nintendo's requirements (don't worry, they're not too extreme). Additional invites could be sent out over the day (and days that follow), but it seems the first group has already received their invites.\n\nHow to get a chance to pre-order a Switch 2 through Nintendo\n\nIf you're looking to get a Switch 2 from Nintendo, you'll first need to head to the company's How to buy Nintendo Switch 2 page. The top of the page has links to some of the most popular U.S. retailers, but your chances of getting one from any of them are slim.\n\nTowards the bottom of the page, you can register your interest in pre-ordering a console. You must log in with your Nintendo account and select whether you want to pre-order the Mario Kart bundle or just the console (you can't change your mind once you've locked in).\n\nAs shared by The Shortcut, there are four key requirements you must meet if you want to be chosen for a console:\n\nMust have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership\n\nMust have a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours as of April 2, 2025\n\nMust be at least 18 years of age\n\nMust have opted in to share gameplay data with Nintendo\n\nMost of those shouldn't be too restrictive to dedicated Nintendo fans, but having a paid Nintendo Online membership might bump out quite a few people. It doesn't specify 12 months of continuous membership, so it seems that as long as you've had 12 months of on-and-off time, you should be able to register.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

If you don't jump in during that period, Nintendo will move on to other people who've expressed interest."}

Over the years, it's been rumored that Apple's struggle to release a folding phone is due to the crease in the screen. Gurman says that next year's phone will feature a \"nearly invisible\" crease when the iPhone is in the open position.\n\nOn the other side of the device, it should have a \"much higher-quality hinge.\" Earlier this year, tipster Instant Digital wrote that Apple will offer a revolutionary liquid metal hinge that utilizes \"amorphous alloy (metallic glass).\" Allegedly, this alloy will be more durable and able to get flatter.\n\nIn comparison, Samsung's flagship foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold series, has improved yearly but hasn't hidden the crease.\n\nStill, this year's Galaxy Z Fold 7 should be a significant upgrade compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Reportedly, Samsung Display has managed to eliminate the crease, but it's unclear if that will appear in this year's model or next year's foldables.\n\nAnother high-end iPhone\n\nAccording to Gurman, the foldable iPhone will be pitched as a \"new high-end model, rather than a niche alternative design.\" This aligns with reports from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that it could release next year or in 2027 with a price between $2,000 and $2,500.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

He claimed the handset will be 4.5mm when unfolded and between 9mm and 9.5mm when folded. Very similar to specs to what the Z Fold 7 should feature this year.\n\nGurman did add a caveat that sources he spoke with said that development could fall behind, which suggests that we might not see the phone until 2027.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide"}

Each year, guests of the Met gala adhere to a dress code that corresponds with the spring exhibition theme of the Costume Institute. This year’s theme, “Tailored for You,” invites guests to don suits and other attire that convey the artistry and craftsmanship of exquisite tailoring.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Met gala’s “Tailored for You” theme is derived from the Costume Institute’s exhibit called Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, an homage to conspicuously stylish Black men from the 18th century to the present. The exhibit highlights how men of African descent throughout the Atlantic World have dressed during different periods of historical, social, and political change. Both the Costume Institute exhibit and the Met Gala dress code arouse historical conversations about the optics of Black masculinity and specifically how Black men who lived in predominantly white environments navigated what 19th century American sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois famously described as “double consciousness.” The term was Du Bois’s way of explaining what it was like to navigate the tension between one’s personal identity and the racial identity constructed for a person by external forces. Fashion is one way to understand how Black men dressed in accordance with their own aesthetic preferences, while also preparing themselves for evaluation of the Western gaze throughout history.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Black men’s dress reflected these tensions. At the time, Black men, both enslaved and free, petitioned colonial leaders to fight on the American side. American leaders had framed participation in the Revolution as a litmus test of masculinity, patriotism, and commitment to liberty among American men. Black men wanted their opportunity to show their valor, strength, and commitment to the colonial struggle. Although George Washington, then Commander of the Continental Forces, eventually allowed free Black men to fight on the American side, he restricted enslaved men from enlisting as soldiers. Some enslaved men fought anyway, with no collective promise of freedom. Washington’s initial refusal to allow enslaved men to enlist as soldiers and to negotiate military service for their freedom created an opportunity for the British. In 1775, hundreds of Black men fought on the British side of the Revolutionary War. The English referred to these Black men as the “Ethiopian Regiment,” but the group consisted of African American men who self-emancipated from colonial American plantations. They had joined the English because of a 1775 promise, Lord Dunmore’s Proclamation, to free enslaved Black American men who fought for the British during the war.\n\nHowever, their uniforms were not the well-documented “red coats” worn by many English soldiers. Instead, Black soldiers who fought with the British wore purple uniforms with conspicuous sashes that stated, “Liberty to Slaves.” In this historical context, the attire worn by Black soldiers in the Ethiopian Regiment was not simply about adhering to uniform requirements. Wearing purple and the accompanying “Liberty to Slaves” sashes alongside British “red coats” against colonial regiments in blue was an aesthetic statement of bravery, and a visual testament to each man’s commitment to his individual freedom, the freedom of each man in his unit, and the emancipation of others who were enslaved. A century later, Black men’s attire carried another powerful message. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Black men enrolled at newly established Black colleges and universities. They showed a collective penchant for dressing in business attire on campus and in public spaces.\n\nA class in session at Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama, April 1940. Bettmann Archive—Getty Images\n\nMany of the students at the first Black colleges were descendants of recently emancipated families. These first-generation Black students entered college during the “nadir of race relations,” in the years that followed Reconstruction (1865-1877), from the 1880s through the 1930s. This era had increased activity from terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan who used intimidation tactics against African Americans to repeal the effects of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. Black men who exercised the right to vote—granted by the 15th Amendment—faced the risk of being harassed, beaten, and killed. Lynchings became a pervasive tactic within the South for intimidating Black men.\n\nAgainst this context, Black male college students often chose to sport their “good clothes.” In the late 19th century, this included some variation of what eventually became known as white collar business attire: a jacket, waist coat, trousers, tie, and clean white shirt. Such self-presentation demonstrated individuals’ penchant for good grooming and attention to personal style. It also defied stereotypes about the inability of formerly enslaved communities to raise sons who could live and behave with comportment and polish, claims that were used to erode Black political power and rights. Launched in 2022, designer Ralph Lauren paid homage to Black collegiate style with a collection that Lauren said was inspired by the traditions of the all-male Morehouse College. It included tailored suits, knits, and wool flannel blazers, a reference to the Morehouse tradition of giving each student a wool flannel blazer during his first few days on campus.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, suits remained important in Black men’s style. In the 1950s and 1960s, participants in the Civil Rights movement often wore their “Sunday best”—dark suits with dark ties and white shirts—as they protested, held rallies, and articulated the tenets of the movement to news reporters at key events. With these clothing choices, Black men of the civil rights era used aesthetics to exemplify the justice and dignity of their cause. Through their traditional attire, they were asserting that their cause aligned with America’s founding principles of justice that were reaffirmed through the Civil War and Reconstruction periods.\n\nThe end of the 20th century saw the rise of African American trends in athleisure wear and street wear—categories of dress that combine elements of athletic wear and business casual clothing. Instead of using dress as a sign of conformity and inclusion, these styles were used to demonstrate the tastes and preferences of the individual. This type of dressing incorporated myriad influences that included the world of athletics, hip hop culture, inspirations from West Africa, and dressing practices of certain African American affinity groups. Many trends associated with “off the clock” dressing became ubiquitous and mainstream. In the 1980s, athletic companies such as Nike capitalized on this by naming shoes after iconic athletes, for example, “Jordans,” for basketball legend, Michael Jordan. Nike released “Jordans” to the public in 1985, which remain an iconic component of athletic wear. In the early 21st century, Black designer and architect Virgil Abloh found ways to fuse athletic wear and street wear with exclusive European couture designs. After years of experimenting and marketing his aesthetic vision, in 2018 Abloh became the first African American appointed menswear artistic director of the world-renowned French fashion house, Louis Vuitton.\n\nToday, as in the past, there are a multiplicity of ways that Black men express their personal style and adorn themselves for the political, professional and social systems of the Western gaze. Many Black men have used attire as a form of activism, an aesthetic symbol of their personal aspirations to live with dignity and work towards their dreams while simultaneously uplifting others with the same aspirations.\n\nAnd, especially in the current political climate, we might expect the same at this year’s Met gala as participants dress with similar goals in mind.\n\nCamille Davis is a cultural and political historian.

But if you’re looking for hands-on impressions from everyday folks who’ve actually tried the new Alexa, they’re curiously hard to find.\n\nDuring Amazon’s earnings call late last week, CEO Andy Jassy told investors that “over 100,000” users are currently testing Alexa+, which Amazon unveiled more than two months ago during a splashy New York City press event.\n\n“People are really liking Alexa+ so far,” Jassy reportedly said on the earnings call.\n\nA hundred thousand people may sound like a lot, but as AFTVnews points out, it’s just a tiny fraction of Alexa’s estimated 100 million-plus active user base, meaning the vast majority of Alexa users has yet to try Alexa+ out for themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, the lucky few who have kicked the tires on the new AI Alexa are generally keeping mum about it.\n\nThere have been a few sightings here and there, including at least one screenshot on Reddit from a user claiming to be in the elite group of Alexa+ testers. But details have been hard to come by, and queries for reports about Alexa+ experiences have far outstripped any actual hands-on experiences.\n\nIn any event, Amazon appears to be moving extremely slowly—and carefully—with its Alexa+ rollout. That’s in contrast to the tone during February’s Alexa+ event in New York, where Amazon seemed to be giving off “full steam ahead” vibes for the new AI Alexa.\n\nAt the presentation, Amazon announced pricing for Alexa+–$19.99 a month, or free for Prime users—along with word that a public preview for the new Alexa would begin in March. Amazon also trotted out confident demonstrations of Alexa’s new tricks, including the ability to control smart devices with natural language queries as well as go shopping, book travel tickets, text contacts, suggest recipes, and more.\n\nTo be fair, Amazon said that the initial public preview would only be for a small group, with Echo Show display owners getting first dibs. But given the bullish tone of Amazon’s Alexa+ in February, it’s surprising the preview rollout has been this slow.\n\nThen again, all the major tech players have been proceeding with caution when it comes to revamping their voice assistants with cutting-edge generative AI abilities.\n\nApple, for example, has reportedly pushed back Siri’s “conversational” AI makeover until 2027, while Google is taking baby steps toward replacing Google Assistant with Gemini. And let’s not forget the new Alexa’s initial reveal way back in September 2023, which was followed by months of silence and bad tidings.\n\nMaybe Amazon will surprise us again with a wider Alexa+ rollout in the very near future, but for now, Alexa’s AI preview remains oddly quiet."}

I always tried to figure out the pattern; to me it was just a pattern, I never thought it can be writing because they didn’t look like letters from any alphabet I knew at the time. I remember thinking that I had finally found a full pattern that was only to be broken in the next square. As I grew older I learned that these pieces that resemble a labyrinth, at first sight, have so much more to offer than just lush visuals. Verses from the Quran were taken and turned into striking artwork carrying valuable messages. The more I learned about Islamic calligraphy and especially square Kufic, the more interesting it became and I will be delighted to share this fascination with my readers.\n\nThe importance of calligraphy in Islamic culture is indisputable. Unlike in Christian culture, the visual depiction of verses from the Holy Book is not used in decoration. Calligraphy shows itself reciting the Quran with beautiful writing decorating everything from mosques to plates to clothes to carpets. Islamic Calligraphy derives from two main styles; Naskh and Kufic. The peculiarity of Kufic Calligraphy is the straight and structured lettering. The Kufic style in itself comes in a variety of styles such as floriated, square, knotted, new style… The patterns that appear complex and random comes with strict rules and systematics. This form of Islamic Art is gaining popularity again due to its moderln and graphic look and resurfacing the traditional alluring patterns.\n\nWork done by Sergio Fabris found on https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kufic_mjriam_nach_Fabris.jpg (no changes were made) This image is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license.\n\nSquare Kufic dates all the way back to the 12th-13th century. Sometimes it is also referred to as banna-i which is a Farsi word and it is mostly used to refer to the architectural square Kufic. There are two main theories about how Square Kufic came into being. The first one suggests a fusion between the Arabic script and the Chinese seal script; the Arabic script was fitted into the forms of Chinese scripts and created square Kufic. The second theory argues that it came from architectural adaptations of Arabic script. The second theory seems to be more accreditable and I saw some articles mentioning this assumption as well. This is further supported by the first examples of square Kufic. These were seen in architecture and was done using bricks packed next to one another. The earliest example is from Ghazni (modern-day Afghanistan) in Sultan Meshud Tower also known as the Victory Towers or Masud III Tower.\n\nShada written in square Kufic style, shaped like buildings\n\nAs I have mentioned above, Kufic calligraphy has strict rules but in square Kufic, these rules are often bent, and even broken. The letters and the overall script is skewed to fit it into shape. This is why sometimes it can be very hard to decipher what was written in the text. I think the fact that it is not always done to pass on the message openly excites me too. Having a somewhat hidden message in the image makes things a lot more amusing. The only rule that is always followed is keeping the filled out and empty spaces even especially when it comes to thickess. Although this is the rule, the artist might knowingly leave out spaces to create a pattern within the pattern. Typically, the diacritical dots are not used when writing down the script in this form but there are examples of square Kufic using diacritical dots as well. Sometimes dots are used not for diacritical purposes but as filler dots.\n\nThe technicalities can get a little bit confusing but I’ll do my best to simplify them and keep it short. The script is written commonly clockwise but it can be anticlockwise or a zigzag pattern. Furthermore, the direction of the writing can change midway to make it fit into the shape. Not only the direction of writing but even the letters and their forms are played with to fill up space evenly. Although the name is Square Kufic, there are many shapes the script can be fitted into. Most commonly it is rectangular shapes but it can be even other words that the Kufic is written into. Once a verse or a single word is written in Square Kufic form, it can be repeated to create a pattern. Sometimes the initial piece is rotated in various ways to create different patterns. This is why I think it is sort of like a pixel, it is the one of many which an image, pattern is created. I envisage that the flexibility it has in comparison to other forms of Kufic makes it easier to adapt to the aesthetic likes we have today. There are two modern-day square Kufic artists that I very much enjoy the work of. These are Kamal Boullata and Ahmed Moustafa. I wasn’t sure if I can include designs of these artists due to copyrights but I most definitely recommend a quick Google search. Ahmed Moustafa can combine different styles of Calligraphy creating multi-layered masterpieces. Kamal Boulata, a Palestinian Christian combines the traditional styles with modern movements combined with impeccable color harmonizations. He uses not only verses from the Quran but also the Gospel of Saint John.\n\nA pattern done by using square Kufic, from the Topkapı Scroll\n\nTaking a step back to the past, one specific example of square Kufic I want to look at in more detail is located in Topkapı Palace, about 30 minutes away from where I am writing this article. The examples on this scroll are some of the oldest of its kind that survived to this day. It is not known exactly when, where, or by whom it was made, although we do know that it was done by a single person. It is assumed that it was done either 15th or 16th century in Iran but not known where exactly in Iran (there is different evidence pointing to different cities). The scroll is impressive in size and design. It is almost 30 meters long which is almost 100 feet. It is actually two different parchments that were combined into one scroll. The scroll shows the different geometrical shapes done in the Timurid architectural style. It is made as a guide for architectural designs and these include square Kufic as well. I can’t help but think how much one had to master different styles of design and calligraphy to be able to prepare a guide for it. Although I have been to the Topkapı Palace multiple times, I don’t remember seeing this scroll (well, the Palace is enormous) but I am very excited to go and examine it in detail.\n\nValérie González, an expert on Islamic visual culture, mentions “Sometimes calligraphy is so manipulated visually that the legibility is very difficult” in a lecture she gave in Casa Árabe. Probably the eyes of the little girl I used to be were interested in this elaborate style because it was not meant to be understood right away. This form of art has so many layers to be discovered and every layer is even more valuable than the previous one. At first, the eyes are blessed with the intricate design. Then the mind tries to decipher the pattern and the words. Lastly, the meaning and the message makes it more memorable and leaves you with something to think over. Unfortunately, I am not able to decipher these on my own and I need a little bit of help to go deeper than the first layer. Nevertheless, my fascination exceeds what my mind comprehends.\n\nFor anyone who wants to learn more about calligraphy in general here is a documentary I very much enjoyed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9uuNagb4po\n\nSome of the useful technical information I found was on two sources;\n\nFirst one is kufic.info, it is a website explaining many aspects of Square Kufic\n\nThe second one is the article here; https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creative-arabic-calligraphy-square-kufic–cms-23012\n\nIf you speak Turkish, I found the article “Kufi Yazıda Geometrik Yorumlar Üzerine Bir Deneme” by Omiir Bakirer very helpful. It can be found on dergipark."}

Despite licking those compatibility issues (mostly) and being lightweight and super-long-lasting battery-wise, I think buyers were hoping for better deals with those new AI-ready chips. Well, here’s just such a deal: a Lenovo convertible OLED laptop with Snapdragon X guts for only $429.99.\n\nWe’ve featured the IdeaPad 5X before—it was one of the few new Snapdragon Copilot+ laptops that actually started out as a good value, thanks to its OLED touchscreen and solid specs. But right now Newegg is selling a refurbished version on eBay for over $400 off the original price from late last year. (And that was for a 512GB SSD, while this one has 1TB.) 16GB of RAM is great for running Windows 11 smoothly, and the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core processor should handle just about everything… with the notable exception of 3D gaming.\n\nI really like that this laptop comes with an OLED touchscreen, a very hard thing to find on any budget design. Other highlights from our review include a surprising selection of ports, fingerprint and face scanning via Windows Hello, and a solid keyboard. The battery life is a little below average for a Snapdragon laptop with 14.5 hours of video playback, but that still puts it well above many other recent designs. That should get you through any workday, even if you’re hitting tons of browser tabs hard.\n\nThis IdeaPad 5X is a refurbished model sold with a 1-year Allstate warranty, which is less than we’ve been seeing recently, yet still much better than the 90-day warranty you get on the same model sold on Newegg for $60 less.

The only exception is if your particular device has been blocked from receiving 24H2 due to a safeguard hold, which can happen if your PC has a software or hardware element that’s known to cause problems with Windows 11 24H2.\n\nWindows 11 normally only downloads the 24H2 update after you’ve searched for it in Windows Update or if your system is configured to auto-update. Now it’ll be delivered to your system even if you haven’t checked for updates, and even if you explicitly don’t want it. This is in line with Microsoft’s earlier move to make Windows 11 24H2 mandatory.\n\nMicrosoft writes the following in the status update:\n\n“Windows 11, version 24H2, also known as the Windows 11 2024 Update, is broadly available. We have reached the last phase of the gradual rollout for version 24H2 via Windows Update on Settings.”\n\nAnd further:\n\n“Devices running Home and Pro editions of Windows 11, versions 23H2, 22H2, and 21H2 that are not managed by IT departments will receive the update to version 24H2 automatically. You can choose the time to restart your device or postpone the update.”\n\nAffected users will be notified by Windows Update when the 24H2 update is being downloaded and about to be installed. You’ll be allowed to postpone (but not refuse) the upgrade as well as choose when it actually gets applied to your PC. It’s unclear how often and how long you’ll be able to keep postponing the 24H2 update."}

This new 1TB PCIe 5.0 drive claims to have sequential read speeds of up to 14,900MB/s, which would let it beat the Crucial T705 by a hair, at least on paper. As Tom’s Hardware notes, it would also be reaching closer to the theoretical maximum speed of PCIe 5.0, 16 gigabytes a second on the standard x4 SSD lane setup.\n\nThe listing says that the drive can write at 14,000MB/s and that the usual 2TB and 4TB models will also be available, presumably both in the standard 2280 (80mm) size and with the pictured slim heatsink. The Amazon listing says it’ll cost €199.99 for the 1TB version and arrive on May 30th, at least in Europe. With the current economic chaos from import taxes, I wouldn’t venture a guess as to what it’ll cost in the US."}

As these titles also run on Valve’s Source 2 engine, this makes sense. Half-Life: Alyx also utilized the same engine and showed what it’s still capable of today.\n\nThere hasn’t yet been an official Half-Life 3 announcement from Valve. However, Project HLX seems to have made a lot of progress despite being under wraps, and given that the game is supposedly fully playable, the developers are likely focusing on optimizations now.

When it comes to security, tools and frameworks such as the Shared Responsibility Model make following good security practices easier than ever. I am equally fascinated by new attack vectors that Cloud Computing enables bad actors to achieve, though.\n\nNot that recently ago, Halcyon put up a really interesting article about a concerning new ransomware campaign targeting Amazon S3 buckets. This is a new kind of ransomware. One that only exists in the cloud, thanks to the cloud, since it leverages some of the many great security features that are built-in into AWS to help organizations achieve security and compliance encrypting Amazon S3 Objects, but to encrypt for ransom instead.\n\nI am not going to go over many details about the attack itself, since there are many great articles out there going over them already, like the one from Halcyon themselves or this one from SentinelOne. So why are we here, then? I believe the kind of information that these types of articles bring are priceless, but I also believe that one should be able to programmatically be able to validate if their own environment are susceptible to this kind of attack, and also validate if they can detect and respond in case they are.\n\nThis article is about understanding how S3 encryption works, how you can use the S3 Ransomware Simulator to test your own environment, how you can programmatically detect this kind of attack, respond to it, but also how to prevent it as well.\n\nThe Attack #\n\nOn its core, the attack is simple, but it requires understanding a bit of how encryption works in Amazon S3.\n\nYou might have heard that Amazon S3 automatically applies encryption to all new object uploaded at no additional cost and with no impact on performance since January 5, 2023. And that’s great news! But there are different ways to encrypt an object in AWS, so first we need to go over them.\n\nUnderstanding S3 Encryption #\n\nClient-side encryption - This is the most straightforward type of Encryption in S3. You/your application encrypt the data, before uploading it to S3, with a key that you own and manage, even if outside of AWS.\n\nServer-side encryption: Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) - This Encryption method is the one that is enabled by default since 2023. You send your objects and they are encrypted by AWS Server-side, with Amazon S3 managed keys, and each object is encrypted with a unique key.\n\nServer-side encryption: AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) - AWS KMS is a managed service to create and manage keys. Here you send your object and AWS uses server-side encryption leveraging these KMS keys to encrypt them, in case a compliance standard you must adhere to requires you to have full control of the encryption keys.\n\nDual-layer server-side encryption: AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS) - Not that different from SSE-KMS. However, some compliance standards require you to apply multilayer encryption to your data, so DSSE-KMS applies two layers of encryption to the objects.\n\nServer-side encryption: customer-provided keys (SSE-C) - It’s like Client-side and Server-Side encryptions had a baby. Like in Client-Side, AWS doesn’t host/manage your keys. Like SSE, you don’t need to worry about encrypting your objects before uploading to the bucket. Here you provide the key as part of the upload request and AWS will encrypt the object on upload, but never save the key anywhere. This is the one we care about.\n\nWhy Is it Effective? #\n\nGiven that an attacker has access to rewrite a victim’s S3 Objects, picking SSE-C as encryption method is the most effective way to guarantee that only they can recover the objects. Since the attacker can create one unique key per victim, they can leverage this key to rewrite the objects, overwrite them and the only way to recover access to these files, would be using they key that belongs only to the attacker.\n\nReplicating The Attack #\n\nIn order to programmatically detect and respond to this kind of attack, we need to first be able to programmatically replicate this kind of attack. When it comes to the S3 API, I am fairly familiar with the GetObject and PutObject actions. But in my mind it wouldn’t make much sense for an attacker to download (GetObject) every single object in a bucket in order to upload (PutObject) them back, while encrypting the data. So I started a research on the best way to encrypt existing objects in a bucket.\n\nThat research led me to, funnily enough, AWS’s own blog page, where a blog post on how to encrypt existing objects described some of the best techniques. Even though the article uses the AWS CLI to encrypt the existing objects, and my goal is to use Python’s Boto3 SDK, it led me exactly to what I was looking for, the CopyObject action. In summary, I just need to make a CopyObject request, where the source and destinations of the copy are the same object, while making sure I was making the proper encryption request as well.\n\nThe Code #\n\nFirst and foremost, you can follow along in your own environment. You can find the code in the S3 Ransomware Simulator GitHub repository.. It tries, as much as possible, to mimic the behavior of an attacker exploiting your own AWS environment.\n\nThe behavior goes as below:\n\nIt enumerate all the buckets available in that account, if the flag --all-buckets is used; It generates and saves to disk an AES-256 encryption key to be used in the attack; For each of the buckets, or just the one in case the flag --bucket-name was used it will: Check if it can PutObject in the bucket, dropping a dummy object Check if it can GetObject in the bucket, getting the previously uploaded dummy file Deletes the dummy file Considering all permissions are in place, and the flag --encrypt-objects was provided, it will: List and encrypt all objects Drop a fake ransom note\n\nAn example of the execution can be seen below:\n\n$ python3 attacker.py --bucket-name raphabot-no-ransomware --encrypt-objects S3 Bucket Encryption Tool with SSE-C Processing specified bucket: raphabot-no-ransomware Generated AES-256 encryption key for SSE-C: M+a4reQycj3pBBZyYs1KE9XpOcdyT7kGq1Mu+q5u+vM = Key MD5: S2k8nSe8W9C7A2JO+Nr4mw == Checking bucket: raphabot-no-ransomware GetObject permission: Yes PutObject permission: Yes Processing bucket: raphabot-no-ransomware Encrypting: regular-file.txt Encrypted 1 files in raphabot-no-ransomware using SSE-C Ransom note dropped in raphabot-no-ransomware. Encryption key saved to encryption_key.bin WARNING: This key is required to decrypt your files. Store it securely! Encryption complete. Total files encrypted: 1 Warning: Without the encryption key, your files cannot be recovered!\n\nIn order to respond, we need first to detect. If you ever read about logging and monitoring in Amazon S3, you know there are many different options to do so. To understand if our buckets are being targets of a Ransomware attack, however, some options are better than others.\n\nSo I created a criteria for how I’d listen to events. Whatever method that was picked, had to:\n\nBe cheap/free Be scalable Be simple Be fast on notifying of the event\n\nIf you’ve been around for a while, you might know that the most traditional way to listen to events in an S3 bucket is to use Event Notification. At first, this looked like a great option, since it is built to have event notifications delivered in seconds, it is free and, although originally only supporting SNS and SQS, since November of 2021 it supports EventBridge. If you are not familiar with Amazon EventBridge, the gist is that it is a serverless service that makes it easier to build scalable event-driven applications.\n\nScalability doesn’t end with the performance of detection, though, and I also want to be able to deploy this detection across many buckets at scale, as code. This is where this solution starts to fall apart. Despite CloudFormation obviously supporting S3 Buckets, the S3::Bucket resource type creates an Amazon S3 bucket, it doesn’t update one. An alternative would be using Custom Resources, but this would come with its own set of challenges when it comes to scale (applying the event notification across multiple buckets before the maximum Lambda timeout, for instance), complexity (writing code to take in consideration any exceptions) and security (maintaining the code dependencies up to date).\n\nAnother great option would be using CloudTrail. CloudTrail comes enabled by default, logs management events across AWS services also by default, and it is free. So, chances are that you are already using CloudTrail. It is fast, with AWS suggesting that CloudTrail publishes log files about every 5 minutes, but real world testing shows that the delay is considerably lower than that. It doesn’t come without its own set of challenges, though.\n\nYes, CloudTrail is enabled by default and it’s free… for management events. Events that happen within buckets, like CopyObjects, are called Data events, which are not enabled by default and they cost $0.10 per 100,000 data events delivered. However, when it comes to scalability and simplicity of deployment, it couldn’t be a better match. Either through the Console or via CloudFormation, one can create a new CloudTrail Trail (you gotta love AWS naming!) to listen to one, some or all Buckets. As you can imagine, even if you filter to listen to data events of only the most critical S3 Buckets, listening to all data events can get pretty expensive pretty quickly. The good news is that CloudTrail enables us to use advanced event selectors to filter which events we are listening to.\n\nCreating an Advanced Selector like the one below, enables us to listen only to the CopyObject event for the selected Buckets:\n\n[ { \"Name\" : \"CopyObject\" , \"FieldSelectors\" : [ { \"Field\" : \"eventCategory\" , \"Equals\" : [ \"Data\" ] }, { \"Field\" : \"resources.type\" , \"Equals\" : [ \"AWS::S3::Object\" ] }, { \"Field\" : \"eventName\" , \"Equals\" : [ \"CopyObject\" ] } ] } ]\n\nIn summary, using CloudTrail, we are able not just to deploy a “detector” at scale easily, but also to cheaply run it at scale as well. The proof is that you can find this Detection defined as CloudFormation code that you can apply today in the same S3 Ransomware Simulator repository.\n\nOnce we detect an attempt, we need to be able to respond to it. The response can and will look different based on different organization preferences. Some would not ever dream of making a change in their AWS environment automatically, others would like to have humans (like you!) notified so they can take action, but some would be fine to take at least some proactive action automatically based on these events, while further investigation is ongoing. For the purposes of this blog post, we will follow AWS’ own best practices on how to remediate if there are unauthorized activity in an AWS account.\n\nThe first step to remediate the compromise of an AWS identity is to, first, understand what kind of identity it is, since the remediation steps to deal with each kind of identity is different. The type of identity used in an API call can be determined by checking the type attribute of the userIdentity object in the CloudTrail event. There are three types of identity in AWS:\n\nIAM User : When one creates an IAM User and wants to make a request against an AWS service, they need to generate a long lived pair of access key id and secret. Shows up as IAMUser in CloudTrail.\n\n: When one creates an IAM User and wants to make a request against an AWS service, they need to generate a long lived pair of access key id and secret. Shows up as in CloudTrail. Assumed Role : This is generally used when an application/service, not a person, needs to access AWS resources. Assuming a role leads to AWS Security Token Service generating a short-lived pair. Shows up as AssumedRole in CloudTrail.\n\n: This is generally used when an application/service, not a person, needs to access AWS resources. Assuming a role leads to AWS Security Token Service generating a short-lived pair. Shows up as in CloudTrail. Identity Center User: AWS IAM Identity Center streamlines and simplifies workforce user access to applications or AWS accounts. For a request made on behalf of an IAM Identity Center user, it will show up as userIdentity in CloudTrail.\n\nNow let’s talk about the actual remediation: blocking this identity from making further requests in the AWS account.\n\nFor an IAM User, for instance, you could disable the user’s Access Keys. It’s good to remember that AWS recommends that, as best practice, to use temporary security credentials (such as IAM roles) instead of creating long-term credentials like access keys. So that’s probably a good idea anyway 😅\n\nFor an Assumed Role, you have options. You could update the role to remove this access, you could attach a policy denying CopyObject actions to S3… the options are close to limitless! If you want to be precise, you can restrict requests from the attacker’s IP address.\n\nExample workflow that I setup for this Response: #\n\nThe workflow below will guarantee that, in case of an attack where the identity is either an IAM User or an Assumed Role, that the identity will be invalidated automatically.\n\nYou can find this sample Response defined as CloudFormation code in the same S3 Ransomware Simulator repository.\n\nOf course, better than remediating this kind of attack, is to prevent it in the first place. Perfect security is a pipe dream that we all chase, but there are some actions that you can take today to make your environment safer against this kind of threat. Here’s a list of some of them.\n\nRestrict SSE-C Usage #\n\nThe most effective action that you can take, in case your organization isn’t using SSE-C, is to block its usage at least in the most critical S3 Buckets. Using Amazon S3 condition keys, you can update your Bucket Policy adding something like the following:\n\n{ \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Id\" : \"PutObjectPolicy\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Sid\" : \"RestrictSSECObjectUploads\" , \"Effect\" : \"Deny\" , \"Principal\" : \"*\" , \"Action\" : \"s3:PutObject\" , \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:s3:::my-important-bucket/*\" , \"Condition\" : { \"Null\" : { \"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm\" : \"false\" } } } ] }\n\nRestrict CopyObject #\n\nIf your applications are not using the CopyObject action, it might be a good idea to block it in your most critical S3 Buckets. However, as pointed out by Jason Kao, one can’t simply block the CopyAction. But if you look closely to the CopyObject API, it is the same PUT http verb as the PutObject. One of the main differences is the collection of x-amz-copy-source headers. So, if we craft our bucket policy to block any PutObject request that contains the x-amz-copy-source header, we are effectively blocking any CopyObject request.\n\nExample of BucketPolicy:\n\n{ \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Id\" : \"CopyObjectPolicy\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Sid\" : \"RestrictCopyObject\" , \"Effect\" : \"Deny\" , \"Principal\" : \"*\" , \"Action\" : \"s3:PutObject\" , \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:s3:::my-important-bucket/*\" , \"Condition\" : { \"Null\" : { \"s3:x-amz-copy-source\" : \"false\" } } } ] }\n\nObject Versioning #\n\nThis is by far the easiest to implement, with the best result. It is, as well, the most expensive. Enabling Object Versioning in your must critical buckets will guarantee that, in case of a Ransomware attack, or even an accidental overwrite or deletion, you can still recover the original Object. Example on how to enable it using the AWS CLI:\n\naws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-important-bucket --versioning-configuration Status = Enabled\n\nNow, in case the identity that the attacker is assuming has full access to the objects in the bucket, they can still delete the older versions using s3:DeleteObjectVersion. You might want to deny this action as well:\n\n{ \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Id\" : \"DeleteObjectVersionPolicy\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Sid\" : \"RestrictDeleteObjectVersion\" , \"Effect\" : \"Deny\" , \"Principal\" : \"*\" , \"Action\" : \"s3:DeleteObjectVersion\" , \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:s3:::my-important-bucket/*\" } ] }\n\nPretty please, avoid using hardcoded secrets #\n\nThis one is self explanatory and a core principle of proper cloud and application security: avoid using hardcoded secrets. Sooner or later, one way or another, hardcoded secrets always find a way to get in the wrong hands. Secret Scanning should be part of your CI/CD pipelines.\n\nAlthough Ransomware is far from being a novel kind of attack, even in Cloud environments such as AWS, as the cloud usage ramps up, so does this kind of attack. As organizations move more and more of critical customer data to the cloud, while adoption techniques such as Workload Isolation to reduce blast radius, it’s more important than ever to have a full grasp of the environment’s posture.\n\nPosture isn’t enough, however. Different teams will have different levels of maturity and you must be ready to detect and respond to this kind of event in near real time. Make sure you are listening to, and reacting to, your CloudTrail events. A good way to understand if you organization is ready for this, but also to get ready as well, is using the provided code to simulate, detect and respond to this kind of attack in your own AWS accounts."}

Today, we will discuss Jobs, another important building block of the Dapr ecosystem.\n\nMany times, you will need to run workflows on a schedule. For example,\n\nRegular file backups : Periodic backups help restore data when there is a failure . So, you could schedule one to back up your data on a regular basis.\n\nPerforming maintenance tasks : Things like file cleanups, recycling VM nodes, and batch processing data are some other scenarios where Dapr Jobs can help.\n\nJobs Architecture\n\nMyApp is the Java application we will be creating today, responsible for scheduling and registering the job.\n\nWhen creating the cron job, the application needs to register a callback endpoint so that the Dapr runtime can invoke it at the scheduled time. The endpoint should be a POST request with a URL pattern similar to /jobs/{jobName} , where jobName corresponds to the name used when registering the job.\n\n\n\nNow, let's look at a practical demonstration. In the sample app, we will create a simple job that runs every 10 seconds. The callback URL registered will print the name of the job that is being invoked.\n\nBecause we have used .NET SDK in all the previous articles, this time we will go with the java-sdk.\n\nStep 1\n\nDownload the Dapr CLI and install it. There is also an MSI that you could use to install the latest version here: https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases.\n\nPowerShell powershell -Command \"iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.ps1 | iex\"\n\n\n\nStep 2\n\nVerify the installation using the following command.\n\nPowerShell dapr -h\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you have Docker running too because the cli downloads docker images of runtime, scheduler and placement services.\n\nNext, it is time to set up the app. For this, we will create a maven project and use the dapr maven dependencies. Gradle could be another choice.\n\nStep 3\n\nCreate a Maven project. Add the following Dapr dependency to it.\n\nJava <dependency> <groupId>io.dapr</groupId> <artifactId>dapr-sdk</artifactId> <version>${project.version}</version> </dependency>\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also discussed registering an endpoint that the scheduler could call. In this case, we are using the Spring framework to register an endpoint. You could also use JAX-RS or any other framework of your choice.\n\nJava <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId> <version>${springboot.version}</version> </dependency>\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n\nApp logic to register the job.\n\nJava import io.dapr.client.DaprClientBuilder; import io.dapr.client.DaprPreviewClient; import io.dapr.client.domain.GetJobRequest; import io.dapr.client.domain.GetJobResponse; import io.dapr.client.domain.JobSchedule; import io.dapr.client.domain.ScheduleJobRequest; import io.dapr.config.Properties; import io.dapr.config.Property; import java.util.Map; public class DemoJobsClient { /** * The main method of this app to register and fetch jobs. */ public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { Map<Property<?>, String> overrides = Map.of( Properties.HTTP_PORT, \"3500\", Properties.GRPC_PORT, \"51439\" ); try (DaprPreviewClient client = new DaprClientBuilder().withPropertyOverrides(overrides).buildPreviewClient()) { // Schedule a job. System.out.println(\"**** Scheduling a Job with name dapr-jobs *****\"); ScheduleJobRequest scheduleJobRequest = new ScheduleJobRequest(\"dapr-job\", JobSchedule.fromString(\"*/10 * * * * *\")).setData(\"Hello World!\".getBytes()); client.scheduleJob(scheduleJobRequest).block(); System.out.println(\"**** Scheduling job with name dapr-jobs completed *****\"); // Get a job. System.out.println(\"**** Retrieving a Job with name dapr-jobs *****\"); GetJobResponse getJobResponse = client.getJob(new GetJobRequest(\"dapr-job\")).block(); // Delete a job. DeleteJobResponse deleteJobResponse = client.deleteJob(new DeleteJobRequest(\"dapr-job\")).block(); } } }\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have created a simple Java class with a main method. Because Jobs is still a preview feature, DaprPreviewClient is used to schedule, get, or delete a Job.\n\nThe ScheduleJobRequest constructor takes in two parameters, the name of the job and the cron expression, which in this case is to run every 10 seconds.\n\nFinally, we call the scheduleJob() method that will schedule a job with the Dapper runtime.\n\nThe getJob() method is used to retrieve the job details of an existing job.\n\n\n\nStep 5\n\nRegister a callback endpoint.\n\nJava import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController; import reactor.core.publisher.Mono; /** * SpringBoot Controller to handle jobs callback. */ @RestController public class JobsController { /** * Handles jobs callback from Dapr. * * @param jobName name of the job. * @param payload data from the job if payload exists. * @return Empty Mono. */ @PostMapping(\"/job/{jobName}\") public Mono<Void> handleJob(@PathVariable(\"jobName\") String jobName, @RequestBody(required = false) byte[] payload) { System.out.println(\"Job Name: \" + jobName); System.out.println(\"Job Payload: \" + new String(payload)); return Mono.empty(); } }\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce it is time to run the scheduled job, the Dapr runtime will call the following endpoint. You could define a PostMapping with the specific Job name like \"/job/dapr-job\" or use a path param like we did above.\n\nStep 6\n\nWrite the startup file for the Spring Boot app.\n\nJava import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; /** * Spring Boot application to demonstrate Dapr Jobs callback API. * <p> * This application demonstrates how to use Dapr Jobs API with Spring Boot. * </p> */ @SpringBootApplication public class DemoJobsSpringApplication { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { SpringApplication.run(DemoJobsSpringApplication.class, args); } }\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7\n\nNow, it is time to run the application. Go to the Maven project folder and run the following command. Change the name of the jar and class if required.\n\nPowerShell dapr run --app-id myapp --app-port 8080 --dapr-http-port 3500 --dapr-grpc-port 51439 --log-level debug -- java -jar target/dapr-java-sdk-examples-exec.jar io.dapr.examples.jobs.DemoJobsSpringApplication\n\n\n\nOutput from the command.\n\n\n\nStep 8\n\nFinally, run the DemoJobsClient .\n\nPowerShell java -jar target/dapr-java-sdk-examples-exec.jar io.dapr.examples.jobs.DemoJobsClient\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput from the command.\n\nPlain Text **** Scheduling a Job with name dapr-jobs *****\n\n\n\nSwitching back to the other window where we ran the command from Step 8, you will notice the following console log.\n\nPlain Text == APP == Job Name: dapr-job == APP == Job Payload: Hello World!\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nDapr Jobs is a powerful tool that can help you schedule workloads without having to take the complexity of using CRON libraries. Go try it out."}

Here’s how to migrate to Teams (or pick another app)", "fullContent": "As announced a few weeks ago, Microsoft has officially discontinued the Skype messaging service as of today, May 5th. Apparently, there wasn’t enough user interest to keep the once-iconic video call app alive.\n\nIf you’re one of the dwindling few who still used Skype in 2025, you might be wondering what you can do going forward. Naturally, Microsoft recommends switching to Teams, which is free to use and conveniently installed on every Windows PC with Microsoft 365. But if you don’t want to use Teams, you have other options, too.\n\nSwitching from Skype to Teams\n\nMicrosoft offers the ability for Skype users to log into Teams using their existing login details, which automatically transfers all chats and contacts.\n\nUp until the final shutdown, it was still possible chat or call via Teams with Skype users who hadn’t yet switched to the new platform. However, this is no longer possible. If you still have a Skype subscription, you can keep using it until the end of the next renewal period. If you have Skype Credits, you’ll be able to keep using them via Teams’ Dial Pad feature.\n\nIf the seamless migration from Skype to Teams didn’t work, you can also try this method to move your contacts from Skype to Teams:\n\nOpen Microsoft Teams. Select the three-dot menu > Settings. Select People. Under Synchronize contacts, select the Manage button. From there, you have the option to synchronize Skype if you use the same Microsoft account for Teams.\n\nYou can also back up your Skype data:\n\nSign into Skype and go to My Account. In the settings page, select the Export contacts option. Skype will offer you all your contacts for download. You will then receive a CSV file that you can open and edit in Excel. For chats and media, log in at go.skype.com/export and select everything you want to download (messages, pictures, videos, recordings, and other files). Confirm and wait for the export to finish. You’ll then get a download link under Available exports.\n\nIt’s not yet possible to delete your Skype account without closing the associated Microsoft account, as explained on this support page. Microsoft was expected to offer the option of deleting just your Skype account without touching your Microsoft account, but as of yet there’s still no information on this.\n\nAlternatives to Skype and Teams\n\nIf you’re looking for another messaging app besides Skype and Teams, the following options are available:"}

But while this might seem like good news for Google’s competitors, it could actually be harmful to some. For example, Mozilla now warns that it could result in the death of Firefox, reports The Verge.\n\nLast year, a federal judge ruled that Google’s search business was an illegal monopoly, forged via exclusive contracts that restrict competition. In the wake of that ruling, the US Department of Justice is now demanding that Google no longer be allowed to pay to be the default search engine in third-party browsers—like Mozilla’s Firefox.\n\nFurther measures to break up Google’s search monopoly include the potential forced sale of the Chrome web browser. There are already several companies waiting to jump in and snatch Chrome for themselves if that happens, but that part isn’t set in stone just yet.\n\nMozilla depends on Google’s search deal\n\nIf Google is no longer allowed to strike deals to be the default search engine in third-party browsers, it would mean a massive financial hit for Mozilla. Firefox brings in about 90 percent of the Mozilla Foundation’s revenue, 85 percent of which comes from a deal with Google. The loss of this revenue would lead to “significant cuts across the company,” said Mozilla’s CFO Eric Muhlheim to The Verge.\n\nShould Mozilla be forced to reduce investments in Firefox product development, it could lead to a dangerous downward spiral. The browser could become less attractive to users and “put Firefox out of business.” Other Mozilla projects, including open-source web tools and efforts to combat climate change through AI research, would also be at risk.\n\nIronically, should the ban on Google actually materialize, it could even strengthen Google’s position. As Muhlheim points out, Firefox’s Gecko engine is “the only browser engine that is held not by Big Tech but by a nonprofit.” Should Firefox die, there’d only be two relevant browser engines remaining: Google’s Blink and Apple’s WebKit.\n\nMozilla negotiates with competitors\n\nMozilla is now negotiating with other search engine providers like Microsoft, looking into the feasibility of making Bing Search the default in Firefox. But even a company like Microsoft probably couldn’t offer as much direct revenue as Google does—and without a bid from Google, the amount Mozilla could negotiate for itself would likely fall.\n\nMozilla has already tried to change the default search engine for all users in the past, which was met with massive outcry and pushback from the user community. This was despite the fact that it would have been possible for every user to simply change it themselves."}

Thanks to Glyph for sharing this thread.\n\nThe thread made me think about what the future of notifications are when thinking about past many-to-many attention-demanding technologies, specifically phone calls.\n\nMy parents had an active landline only a few years ago, I can attest that the value-to-noise ratio on the landline was zero. The process to arrive there involved three steps:\n\nAt some point, >90% of incoming calls were not welcome.\n\nVoicemail was added to avoid the aforementioned calls. This removed the \"attention-right-now\" ability of phone calls.\n\nCongratulations! Phone calls are now useless compared to text messages.\n\nMy parents knew that anyone who called was a \"solicitor\" or a scammer and so let every call go to voicemail and listened at the end of the day. My brother and I stopped calling the landline because they never picked up, we were calling and texting our parents on their mobile phones because those actually got responses. The network had destroyed its utility and most people moved on.\n\nThis isn't exclusive to landlines either, this happens on mobile phones, too. For example, my phone does not ring unless you're in my contacts list. Unknown phone numbers are sent straight to voice mail. The network has an extremely low value to noise ratio without this filtering, and it's hard to imagine how many scam victims and human lifetimes would be saved if this were the default for mobile phones. Alas.\n\nPhones used to be a way to get someone's attention in the moment and have a conversation if the other party was available. \"Getting someone's attention\" was the whole point. The lack of authentication and filtering controls meant that the many-to-many attention-grabbing network was destined for this fate. Now notifications are in a very similar boat, and I am \"calling\" (heh) that one day notifications will either be a thing of the past (ie, most people disable them) or more configurable and filterable to match user expectations.\n\nIf you look at my phone, almost every application that actually generates notifications is either disabled or it's a messaging application like iMessage, Signal, Discord, etc. Apple does not make this easy at all, you need to click into each application individually and disable notifications (flashback to having to do the same for disabling Apple Intelligence, coming from a \"design-oriented\" company).\n\nSo what would voicemail for notifications look like? All notifications received over the course of the day delivered as a sort of \"newsletter\" at a specific time of your choosing? Maybe the ability to \"sinkhole\" notifications that matched or didn't match a pattern. I want to see more APIs and experiments around notification management so that applications could be installed to manage notifications regardless of whatever bad UI Apple forces on its users.\n\nI would love to see a mobile operating system manufacturer or app store actually embrace this future for notifications: the days of spamming users' pockets against their will is not long for this world. They do nothing for a company and only teach users to disable notifications. Will the utility of this \"network\" be preserved or continue down the road of users steadily disliking their time, friendships, and attention being abused for a fractional ROI?\n\nThis little thought exercise made me even more excited for \"Other Networks: A Radical Technology Sourcebook\" by Lori Emerson which can be pre-ordered on bookshop.org. If you're reading this book (or others like it) and reach out!"}

How much “liaison” protecting the most wealthy and educated 3% of the population against the curse of perceived perpetual Jewish victimhood is still warranted? And how will such “liaison” differ from the orders delivered directly from Benjamin Netanyahu, the “Chosen” leader, of the Jewish state of Israel to provide Trump and the rest of the US government with their marching orders, just as was the case with Genocide Joe Biden and his merry band of largely Jewish/Zionist cabinet members?\n\nProfessor Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University has described the current Donald Trump regime as an “Israel First Administration” packed with Zionists at all levels. The State Department Press Secretary Tammy Bruce has declared that “Anyone who tries to touch Israel will wind up in hell.” But there are some who are still brave enough to go against the tide. The Institute for Historical Review, which is one of the few online publishers and free speech associations that still survive in the good old USA, has been confronting the Israel Lobby for forty-seven years. In an email that appeared last week they discuss another new Jewish appointment and laid out the problem in plain English that even Donald Trump might understand:\n\n“Power, Priorities, and Puppeteers: Who Really Governs America?”: The nomination of Yehuda Kaploun — a Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi, Trump loyalist, and confidant of Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson — as US Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism underscores an uncomfortable reality: Zionist interests wield disproportionate influence over American politics, even as the nation fractures under economic despair. Kaploun’s appointment, framed as a defense against antisemitism, instead reveals a political dynamic that prioritizes the interests of world Jewry over the needs of ordinary Americans. Consider the timing. Household debt has soared to $18.04 trillion, credit card delinquencies hit 14-year highs, and inflation continues to erode wages. Yet policymakers focus on policing campus activism, cracking down criticism of Israel, while ignoring the collapse of social mobility. Kaploun’s own rhetoric comparing US universities to “1930s Germany” diverts attention from the rising cost of living and the United States’ fraying social fabric. Meanwhile, pro-Israel groups like AIPAC have funneled $100+ million into elections, ensuring bipartisan fealty to policies that prioritize Israeli interests at the expense of America. This is not governance. It’s an occupation by foreign interests.”\n\nThe IHR point is well made and applies to Biden, Trump and Congress as well as to the 38 states that require citizens to sign documents or swear oaths pledging themselves not to support any boycotts of Israel if they wish to receive benefits or jobs. To even suggest that Israel and American Jews are some kind of victims who must be protected at a time when they are actively engaged in genocide and complete ethnic cleansing of literally millions of Palestinians.\n\nMy principal complaint with the government Jewish agenda is that it creates two classes of people before the rule of law, i.e. those who are Jews and must be protected and the rest of us who, on the contrary, will face the consequences if we so much as criticize Israeli or Jewish behavior. Ironically, we can criticize our own country or any other country in the world, but not Israel. If we are a legal resident or a student on an educational visa who crosses the line we can have that status erased and be deported without any due process. It also means that any encounters with law enforcement or government that has any taint of being critical of Jews can lead to two level justice, as many foreign students in the US are currently discovering.\n\nA story last week out of Crown Heights Brooklyn illustrates precisely what I mean. Israel’s monstrous Security Chief Itamar Ben-Gvir, who believes in killing all Palestinians if it becomes necessary to remove them, was in town being cheered on by a large crowd of the indigenous Ultra Orthodox Jews. A local resident, a woman in her thirties, wondered what all of the noise was about and went out to take a look. She was immediately set upon by a large crowd of roughly one hundred, which screamed at her that she was a “Palestinian demonstrator,” which was not true. She “feared for her life as she was chased, kicked, spit at and pelted with objects by [the] mob of Orthodox Jewish men. She recalled how ‘They were shouting at me, threatening to rape me, chanting death to Arabs. I thought the police would protect me from the mob, but they did nothing to intervene.’ As the chants grew in intensity, a lone police officer who had joined her sought to escort her to safety back towards her apartment. They were followed for blocks by hundreds of men and boys jeering in Hebrew and English. Video shows two of the men kicking her in the back, another hurling a traffic cone into her head and a fourth pushing a trash can into her. She was beaten and kicked and even had a large garbage can thrown on top of her.” The woman later recalled how “I felt sheer terror. I realized at that point that I couldn’t lead this mob of men to my home. I had nowhere to go. I didn’t know what to do. I was just terrified.” After several blocks, the officer moved the woman into a police vehicle which prompting one assailant to yell, “Get her!” but the crowd erupted then in cheers as she was driven away. Interestingly, there were many police officers in the immediate area, presumably to protect all the rioting Jews from attacks by antisemites, but they had not intervened while the woman was being pursued apart from the one officer who came to her assistance.\n\nThe entire episode was filmed by bystanders and one would think that the Jews who had beaten the woman would face some consequences, but as is always the case when it is Jews/Israelis who are committing crimes there is the presumption of antisemitism at play and nothing happens. I could find nothing in the subsequent press coverage that suggests that anyone was arrested or even detained. I have previously suggested that this has also been the pattern connected to the past year’s demonstrations over the slaughter in Gaza. The universities and local police are quick to detain those normally peaceful demonstrators regarded as pro-Palestinians but when those individuals are in turn physically attacked by Jewish organized groups the Jews are not subjected to the same standard of law enforcement. To put it mildly, there is absolutely no mandate to protect Palestinians or ordinary Americans who become victims in the violent counterattacks on peace encampments staged by local Jews and, reportedly, including some Israeli army veterans in incidents at both Columbia University and the University of California at Los Angeles. Have any violent Israelis been arrested or deported? No? Apparently, the US “justice system” is focused on serving Israel at the expense of the US Constitution’s protection of free speech and free association.\n\nThe “Jewish Exemption” that is in practice at all levels of US and local government is readily discernible nearly everywhere to include the media coverage of Israeli atrocities. Israel, has, for example, its own completely illegal nuclear arsenal obtained through theft and deception from the United States, but nobody in the US government is allowed to mention that and it rarely comes up in the press. And no one is permitted to enforce American laws if they impact on Israel, like the Leahy Law which forbids military assistance to any country that violates human rights “with impunity.” Israel clearly is qualified to be sanctioned by that standard, but no US Administration has dared to enforce the law for fear that the powerful Israel Lobby will retaliate.\n\nMy point is that every time one turns around currently the government is doing something to exempt Jews or Israel from the consequences of their own behavior while at the same time the folks who criticize that behavior are being punished with denial of free speech and crippling penalties that will in some cases diminish their prospects for the rest of their lives. This has got to stop and all Americans must be treated the same under law. Jews are the most protected and coddled tribe that goes to make up what we Americans call a “country” but they are not the only ones here. It is time that the corrupted political class in this nation begin to realize that.\n\n*\n\nClick the share button below to email/forward this article.

But legitimate AI tools can be corrupted, too. Hackers can feed data to the AI that poisons it—the goal is to influence the AI’s dataset and change its output.\n\nPerhaps an attacker wants a more discreet outcome, like introducing biases. Or perhaps instead malicious results are wanted, like dangerous inaccuracies or suggestions. AI is just a tool—it doesn’t know if it’s being used for positive or negative benefit. If you don’t know what to look for, you could become the victim of cybercrime.\n\nSo last week while I was at the RSAC Conference, which brings together thousands of cybersecurity experts, I took the opportunity to dive into AI security with Ram Shankar Siva Kumar, a Data Cowboy with Microsoft’s red team. Red teams function as internal penetration testers for companies, purposely looking for ways to break or manipulate a system to find its vulnerabilities.\n\nDuring our chat, Kumar gave me a handful of sharp tips on how to stay safe from compromised AI, whether it’s a chatbot you’re conversing with or an agent processing info more automatically. Because, as it turns out, spotting a poisoned AI is very difficult.\n\n1. Stick to the big players\n\nAI tools created and maintained by bigger players in the space (like OpenAI’s ChatGPT) are easier to trust—though not immune to vulnerabilities. Jon Martindale / Foundry\n\nWhile every AI tool will have vulnerabilities, you can better trust the intent (and the size of the teams ready to mitigate them) from the bigger players in the field. Not only are they more established, but they should have clear goals for their AI.\n\nSo, for example, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini? More trustworthy than a chatbot you randomly found in a small, obscure subreddit. At least, you can more easily believe in a baseline level of trust.\n\n2. Know that AI can make things up\n\nFor a long while, you could ask Google which was bigger, California or Germany—and its AI search summary would tell you Germany. (Nope.) It stopped comparing miles against kilometers only recently.\n\nThis is an innocent hallucination, or instance when wrong information is given as factually correct. (You know how your two-year-old neighbor confidently proclaims that dogs can only be boys? Yeah, it’s like that.)\n\nWith compromised AI, it could hallucinate in more treacherous ways or simply steer you in purposefully dangerous ways. For example, maybe an AI is poisoned to ignore safeties around giving medical advice.\n\nSo any advice or instructions you’re given by AI? Always accept them with polite skepticism.\n\n3. Remember AI only passes along what it finds\n\nWhen an AI chatbot answers your questions, what you see is a summary of the information it finds. But those details are only as good as the sources—and right now, they’re not always top caliber.\n\nYou should always look over the source material AI relies on. Occasionally, it can take details out of context or misinterpret them. Or it may not have enough variety in its dataset to know the best sites to lean on (and conversely, which publish little meaningful content).\n\nI know some people who share juicy news, but they don’t always think hard about who told them the info. I always ask them where they heard those details and then decide for myself if I think that source is reliable. I bet you do this, too. Extend the same habit to AI.\n\n4. Think critically\n\nWikipedia’s early days taught us to trust but verify information offered by its contributors. (Which you should still do.) Handle AI chatbots similarly. PCWorld\n\nTo sum up the above tips: You can’t know everything. (At least, most of us can’t.) The next best skill is understanding who to rely on—and how to decide that. Malicious AI wins when you turn off your brain.\n\nSo, always ask yourself, does this sound right? Don’t let confidence sell you.\n\nThe above tips will get you started. But you can keep that momentum going by regularly cross-referencing what you read (that is, looking at multiple sources to double-check your AI helper’s work) and by learning who to ask for additional help. My goal is being able to answer a second question after that work: Why did someone create this source article or video?\n\nWhen you know less about a topic, you have be smart about who you trust."}

In fact, it can often be recovered with the right tools. That’s where Sdelete comes in.\n\nSdelete is short for Secure Delete and it permanently wipes files by overwriting them–sometimes multiple times, which makes recovery virtually impossible. This tool is part of the Sysinternals suite from Mark Russinovich, which now belongs to Microsoft. It works according to the Clearing and Sanitizing standard DOD 5220.22-M of the US Department of Defense.\n\nThis is how it works via the command line: The tool comes in a zip archive and offers the command sdelete after unpacking. For this command to work in the Windows command prompt in any directory, it must be located in a folder that is part of the Windows path variable Path.\n\nThe easiest way is to copy the contents of the archive to the folder C:\\Windows. Now call up the command prompt by pressing the key combination Win-R and entering cmd. This action starts the command prompt, in which you enter the command sdelete to delete files or folders.\n\nThe Sdelete command line program from Sysinternals Tools allows you to permanently delete files and folders. IDG\n\nFor example, if you want to delete the file “Document1.docx, enter the following:\n\nsdelete -p 3 [path]\\Document1.docx\n\nPlease replace [path] with the location of the file, including the drive letter, such as N:\\files. The -p 3 indicates the number of overwrites. In this case, there are three. If you want to delete a folder, including all subfolders and files contained in it, such as the Temp folder, specify your parameters as follows:\n\nsdelete -p 3 -s [path]\\Temp\n\nThe -s parameter also deletes the subfolders. The -r parameter is also interesting: this removes the write protection attribute before deleting the file. Otherwise, there would be error messages for protected files.\n\nThe freeware Sdelete-Gui offers simple user guidance for the command line tool Sdelete. It adds the “Secure Delete” command to the Windows Explorer context menu. IDG\n\nSdelete can also overwrite the entire free space on a drive. The process securely deletes all remaining files. You can perform the deletion by using the parameter -z. If the free space on drive C: is to be overwritten, the command looks like this:\n\nsdelete -z C:\n\nDepending on the size of the drive, it may take some time for the command to complete.\n\nDelete with user guidance: For those who find the command prompt too cumbersome, there is user guidance for the sdelete command. We call the tool Sdelete-Gui. When you start it for the first time, it asks you how often you want sdelete to overwrite a file and then suggests ten times. That’s a lot. Three times is also very reliable.\n\nClick on Enable to set the desired number and close the window with the X in the top right-hand corner. You will now find the Secure delete command in the Windows Explorer context menu. Select the file or files you want to securely delete and right-click on them. In Windows 11, first select Show more options and then Secure delete.\n\nAttention: Sdelete will immediately delete the data without prompting you. Please note that Sdelete deletes your data reliably. Once you use the command, there is no way to restore them. You should therefore use Sdelete with caution."}

While we will continue to help you find the best deals, today, we thought we would take a break from it. Instead, we will focus on some of the limited edition cameras and lenses from Leica, which are not only costly but also available for purchase. If you are wondering why we are working on this, well, why not? Once in a while, it is great to give some truly exemplary piece of gear space too.\n\nLeica Noctilux-M 75mm f1.25 ‘Friends of Leica’\n\nLeica Noctilux-M 1:1.25/75mm ASPH ‘Friends of Leica’\n\nThe Noctilux-M series lenses from Leica offer truly exceptional colors, image quality, and bokeh, and they are loved by many portrait photographers. However, this special edition of Noctilux has only 20 models available around the world and was created for ‘Friends of Leica’ in Singapore. We reviewed a normal edition of the lens, and we were floored by its performance. As we said, “The optics are stunning without the use of editing. Aberrations and distortions are very minimal. It produces incredible bokeh, lovely tones, and has plenty of sharpness.”\n\nLeica M6 “King of Thailand” 50th Anniversary Edition\n\nLeica M6 Limited Edition on eBay\n\nOriginally, the Leica M6 was introduced in the 1980s, and since then, the camera has had various versions. For instance, we tested the M6 TTL, a film camera, which we adored. However, in 1995, Leica launched the M6 King of Thailand Edition, which was to commemorate the golden jubilee of His Majesty King Bhumiphol Adulyadej of Thailand. What made this film camera so special is that it is designed with 24 karat gold, and comes with a 50mm f2 Summicron with the same finish. Now, if you are interested, you can buy the collector’s item on eBay.\n\nLeica M and 50mm f2 APO-Summicron Red Anodized\n\nLeica M Red Anodized\n\n50mm f2 APO-Summicron Red Anodized\n\nThe company introduced the Leica M and 50mm f2 APO-Summicron in blazing red color, and only 100 models of the same are available around the world. The lens was introduced in 2016, and a year later, the M series camera was unveiled. The specifications of both devices remain the same as their original models, the only difference being the “red anodized finish.” In our test of the original M model, launched in 2013, we said: “Without the shadow of a doubt, one can say that the M Typ 240 is the pinnacle of Leica’s rangefinder camera evolution, and most certainly one of the best digital cameras currently around.” This won’t change even today.\n\nSet of Leica C-LUX and D-LUX Cameras\n\nVarious C-LUX and D-LUX cameras from Leica\n\nLeica launched the C-LUX and D-LUX series for travel photographers, but the cameras were said to be replicas of Panasonic’s compact series devices, such as TZ200 and DMC-LX7. However, it seems that various editions of these compact cameras are now on sale. The user is selling the following models: C-LUX 3; C-LUX 3 “AMEX” (only 25 models available), “Zadig & Voltaire”, and “AIDA” editions; D-LUX 3 silver, D-LUX 4 “Titanium Special Set”, “Safari”, and “China 1949-2009” editions; D-LUX 5 “Titanium Special Set”, “X Uniform Experiment”, and “Red Bull Illume” editions; and D-LUX 6 black painted “100 years edition set.” We aren’t sure who would buy the entire set, but it certainly is fascinating to see them together.\n\nLeica M6 Royal Wedding Edition\n\nLeica M6 Royal Wedding Camera\n\nYet another limited edition device, there were only 200 units sold of this camera. To give you a recap, the camera, which is silver and has a chrome finish, was released in 1995 for Nordisk Foto Import A/S. This was to commemorate Prince Joachim of Denmark’s marriage to Miss Alexandra Manley, Hong Kong, on November 18, 1995. Like the emblem on the top plate, the camera also has a burgundy wooden box and includes blue velvet insides. The camera is paired with Summicron-M 35mm f2, which is not a limited edition like the camera.\n\nLeica M9-P Grey Rahn Edition\n\nLeica M9-P Grey Rahn Edition\n\nThe Leica M9-P is an 18MP camera with ISO up to 2500 and a 2.5-inch 230,000k-dot LCD. Just like the original camera, the insides of the M9-P grey are the same. However, what makes it interesting is its body. The Rahn edition comes with a Summicron-M 45mm f2 lens with a silver finish. The body of the camera has military grey lacquering, which is also used for the camera’s cladding. The camera and lens both have special numbers engraved on them, too.\n\nLeica M6 TTL Safari/Green Millennium\n\nLeica M6 TTL Safari/Green Millennium\n\nYet another film camera offering, the Leica M6 TTL had various versions, with the Safari edition producing only 300 models, which came with a 0.85m viewfinder. According to Jo Geier, the camera was announced in 2000 after a Hong Kong dealer placed a special order for 300 green-painted M6 TTL cameras. The rewind on this camera is known to be shaped like the M3/M2/M1.\n\nWe do hope you had a great time reading and learning about the models, just as we did while writing the piece.

Peter Koenig", "fullContent": "When you go through the columns of mainstream as well as non-mainstream newspapers and newsletters, broadcasting, media in general, you find predominantly talk about war, about conflicts, weapons, their destructive powers, brewing up to wars, and who does what to whom – to dominate.\n\nHas anybody ever thought of neutrality as a precursor to peace, written about neutrality as a stepping stone to peace?\n\nHardly.\n\nHardly a word of PEACE.\n\nPeace is not on the menu. It is war and weaponry that we analyze, think about, and write about – but not peace.\n\nWhy not?\n\nWe all – meaning We, the People, and the vast majority of non-mainstream authors – claim to be for peace. But where is it reflected?\n\nHardly anywhere.\n\nWars and weaponry and banks and individuals – all of whom benefit from the killer apparatuses — are the topics of our day and age. They are in the daily spotlight.\n\nEven those purportedly against wars and conflicts are indirectly propagating the use of guns, bombs, tanks, fighter jets, even kamikaze drones – all aggressive killer-instruments, by non-stop writing and debating about them. By doing so, violence and massacre – the image of war – is put in people’s minds.\n\nStop doing this.\n\nTalk about neutrality, about mediation for peace, about peace itself, about life in a harmonious society.\n\nPutting peaceful cohabitation in people’s minds, will eventually lead to peace.\n\nTalking and reading about war and destruction is depressive. Talking and writing about peace is rejuvenating, is enlightening – is spreading a feeling of hope and light.\n\nInstead, the narrative is about war history, wars in the future, war threats – be aware [and in parenthesis: they say “be afraid!”] war analyses, left and right, and how and why “history will repeat itself.“ It repeats itself only if we let it, if we proliferate the idea to repeat itself.\n\nNot from alone.\n\nIt is because we are constantly echoing history, because we cannot let go thinking of destruction and violence.\n\nAs an alternative, we may and should dialog about Neutrality and Peace. How can peace be achieved? What are the basic parameters, conditions for peace.\n\nWe must put out there, the narrative of Neutrality and Peace.\n\nGranted, it is a new way of thinking.\n\nBut without us starting this new way of thinking, it will not happen.\n\nOne of the key paradigms for peace is neutrality.\n\nNeutrality does not take sides.\n\nNeutrality does not sanction – and especially, neutrality does not sanction because somebody else sanctions. Neutrality is free of prejudice. Neutrality is the A and O of peace.\n\nNeutrality sees the crime in sanctions and stands out as an example.\n\nSanctions are against basic human rights. They affect the most vulnerable of society.\n\nThose people of wisdom, who designed and defined basic human rights, knew what they were doing.\n\nThe spirit of peace is in us.\n\nWe must allow it to come to the fore – we must nurture it.\n\nAnd we can.\n\nTOGETHER we can. In unison we are stronger.\n\nPeace in our minds overwhelms war.\n\nStop writing about war and destruction.\n\nWrite about neutrality, peace, and prosperity and about how to achieve it.\n\nWrite about what a world in peace might look like.\n\nEven if you feel it is just a dream. Let it be a dream.\n\nEvery major societal change, every evolution in human thinking has started with a dream.\n\nDream on, share your dreams – and let actions follow and invite Us, the People to do likewise.\n\nWar is out, peace is in.\n\nPLEASE.\n\n\n\n*\n\nClick the share button below to email/forward this article.

I won’t get into all the details now, but the tough times I’ve been living through have left me with many cracks. And although I’ve still managed to be a reasonably successful person, on most days I struggle desperately with my self-confidence. I just don’t feel good enough. I feel flawed. I feel like my cracks make me undesirable…”\n\nThose are the opening lines of an email I received recently from a new reader of our blog. I’m sharing that excerpt today, with permission, because Angel and I have spoken to hundreds of other readers, clients, and live event attendees over the past 15 years who struggle in a very similar way. In fact, almost all of us struggle with not feeling “good enough” at various points throughout our lives.\n\nIf you can relate right now — if today is one of those days — it’s time for a quick wake-up call and story about life:\n\nWe all have a few cracks.\n\nOnce upon a time there was an elderly woman who needed to walk down to the river every morning to fetch water for drinking, cooking and cleaning. She carried two buckets with her, filled them up at the riverbank, and walked back with them to her rural cottage home.\n\nOne of the buckets was newer, perfectly sealed, and held its water flawlessly. But the second bucket was older and contained a few thin cracks that would leak water onto the ground as the elderly woman walked. By the time she arrived home, typically about one third of the water in the second bucket had leaked through its cracks.\n\nOne day, on the walk down to the river, the cracked bucket — who had always felt like it wasn’t as good as the other bucket – said to the elderly woman, “I want you to know that I’ve been leaking water every morning for the past several years. I’m so sorry for being cracked and making your life more difficult. I understand if you need to replace me with a better bucket.”\n\nThe elderly woman smiled. “Do you really think I haven’t known about your cracks this whole time?” she asked. “Look at all the beautiful flowers that grow on the path from my cottage to the river. I planted their seeds, but every morning it’s you who does the watering.”\n\nRemember:\n\nFeeling good enough in life, in work, in business, and in our relationships has everything to do with how we personally judge the cracks in our own bucket. Because we all have a few cracks!\n\nBut are they cracks that wreck us, that taint us, and that ruin our experience and desirability?\n\nOr do our cracks water a trail of flowers we haven’t even stopped to appreciate?\n\nLet this be your wake-up call!\n\nChoose to see the flowers through the cracks in your own bucket — choose to see how it’s exactly those cracks that make you good enough — and your whole universe will shift!\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nYes, it’s your turn to take a deep breath when you need one. Sometimes the pressure coming from peers, family, work, and society in general is enough to make us feel less than “good enough.” If we don’t have the “right” job, relationship, house, and so forth by a certain age or time frame, we assume we’re flawed — cracked! Again, Angel and I hear about this kind of self-defeating mindset from our clients, our students, and our readers/subscribers on a daily basis, and we aren’t immune either. Feeling good enough takes consistent practice.\n\nIt’s time to practice!\n\nBut before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this short story/essay. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂\n\nAlso, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week."}

Some of these writers have expressed great appreciation for him while others have expressed great concern. The reactions to these articles, and especially the critiques, have been interesting to me. Some people have expressed dismay that their fellow Protestants would use the opportunity of the pope’s death to detail their concerns about the man and his office and even to discuss his eternal state.\n\nThough I know it can seem unkind to use a person’s death as an opportunity to write about his flaws, it’s important to remember some key facts about Pope Francis, the papacy, and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThis is one of those key facts: For as long as he was pope, Francis was the world’s most prominent false teacher. Though there are many other false teachers in this world, none of them had even a fraction of his reach or power and none were regarded with such respect.\n\nThroughout Francis’ life, he consistently affirmed the errors of Catholic doctrine that are detailed in its official documents (such as the Catechism of the Catholic Church) while adding new errors of his own. Never in his life did he proclaim a gospel through which sinners are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone and never did he expect it of the millions of clergy he oversaw. Rather, he consistently preached a gospel in which human effort must be added to divine grace. Furthermore, he consistently venerated Mary as one who, with Jesus, co-mediates the relationship between God and man. He dispensed countless indulgences which are said to lessen or remove the torment a believer must face in purgatory—punishment he must endure in order to become sufficiently holy to enter heaven.\n\nIn short, Francis dedicated his entire life to laboring within the world’s largest heretical denomination—one that has more than a billion adherents. He was Supreme Pontiff of it for his final 12. He spent 67 of his years in the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits), an order created for the specific purpose of countering and eradicating the teachings of Protestantism. During his time as pope, he communicated heretical doctrines to more people than any other human being. No healer, no crusader, no preacher, and no teacher came close.\n\nWe could go further. The papacy is the foremost and most consistent position of false teaching in the history of the world. For centuries, the pope has been using the name of Christ to lead people away from Christ. He has promised heaven while delivering hell. Countless Roman Catholics have gone to damnation after being assured by their church and their pope that they were on the path to salvation. The papacy has consistently proclaimed a gospel that cannot save while formally anathematizing the one gospel that actually can! I joyfully admit that there can be true believers within the Roman Catholic Church, but they are believers in spite of the church’s official doctrine, not because of it.\n\nThe papacy has consistently proclaimed a gospel that cannot save while formally anathematizing the one gospel that actually can! Share\n\nSo when we set Pope Francis in this context, it makes sense that there is a sense of relief that he is gone. We will shed no tears when the President of the Mormon Church dies and can no longer bring leadership to an institution that is leading so many millions astray and can no longer bring false prophecies in the name of Jesus. We will shed no tears when Kenneth Copeland dies and stops speaking lies and enriching himself in the name of Jesus. And neither is there reason to lament the death of Pope Francis as if he was a brother, a good man, or anything other than one who led people to darkness in the name of light. Of course, we can lament the reality of death. We can grieve and tremble at the reality that he must now face divine judgment. But we need not pretend he was one who knew God or was loved by God. In that way, his death is an appropriate moment to remind ourselves of the reality Protestants had universally agreed upon until the past few decades—that the Roman Catholic Church denies the gospel and is therefore not a true church.\n\nThough it is tragic that only death could silence Francis, is it not good that death has silenced him? For with his death, the world’s most prominent and most respected false teacher is no longer teaching his heretical doctrines and no longer leading people astray."}

Not just for the fans, but for the club’s identity, its continuity, and the emotion woven into its culture. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s decision to leave Liverpool for Real Madrid, confirmed on the Anfield Index podcast by respected journalist David Lynch in conversation with Dave Davis, is one of those moments.\n\nThis isn’t just a transfer—it’s a transformation. It’s a challenge to the new regime, and a test of Arne Slot’s philosophy before his second season has even begun.\n\nNot Unexpected, But Still Deeply Felt\n\nDavid Lynch put it plainly: “I’m not surprised because we’ve felt this one has been coming for some time now.” And that may be the cruellest truth. Liverpool fans have sensed this for a while. Rumours of Real Madrid’s long-standing interest in Alexander-Arnold were never quite silenced, and perhaps, in hindsight, the writing was on the wall once Jurgen Klopp announced his own departure.\n\nStill, that doesn’t dull the impact. “There’s a bit of sadness. A boyhood Liverpool fan and a local lad has come through the ranks and has won everything at the club and he wants to go and try something new,” said Lynch. It’s a statement laced with acceptance but anchored by emotion.\n\nTrent’s departure marks more than just a high-profile exit. It cuts into the club’s fabric. A local academy graduate, a Champions League winner, a two-time Premier League champion now under Slot—it’s hard to replace the symbolic weight of that CV.\n\nSlot’s First Test of Identity\n\nWhat’s fascinating now is how Arne Slot responds. Coming off the high of winning the Premier League in his debut campaign—a remarkable feat by any standard—he now faces a fundamental challenge. Replacing not just a tactical asset, but a cultural one.\n\nThere is, however, clarity in the situation. “It gives Arne Slot a choice to make in his lineups for the rest of the season and I believe that he has to start Conor Bradley for the last few games,” Lynch added. This isn’t just a squad shuffle. This is about preparing for the future.\n\nAnd it’s a future that needs planning. Liverpool are not in rebuild mode per se, but evolution is essential, especially under a new manager with his own style of play. Slot must now decide if he leans into continuity with Bradley, or searches for an external solution in the market.\n\nBradley’s Chance, But With Perspective\n\nConor Bradley is the natural heir in some ways. “The best way to prepare Conor Bradley to be the first-choice right-back next season is by playing him, even if it is just for the last three games,” Lynch insisted. That’s sound logic, and it fits the Liverpool model—youth integration, development from within.\n\nStill, expecting Bradley to mirror or replace Alexander-Arnold immediately is both unfair and unrealistic. Trent has not just played the right-back role; he’s redefined it. His passing range, vision, and ability to control tempo are virtually unparalleled in that position. The 25-year-old has more in common with elite midfielders than traditional full-backs.\n\nThat’s what Slot must reckon with. It’s not just about replacing a player—it’s about reshaping the way Liverpool build play, transition, and control matches.\n\nEmotional Fallout and Club Culture\n\nPerhaps the most poignant line from Lynch came not from tactical analysis, but from his heart: “The overriding emotion is disappointment because he is a phenomenal player who I’ve loved watching.” That sentiment captures what most fans feel.\n\nHe continues: “Part of me gets it but you can’t hide that disappointment and wishing that he had played out his career at Liverpool.” It’s this duality—understanding the ambition, yet mourning the loss—that typifies modern football.\n\nThere are also fans “angry about the way this has been done,” but as Lynch notes, “I’m not in that area but I do get that there’s a range of emotions amongst the supporters.” This is a club with deep emotional connections, and those emotions are valid.\n\nIn the end, Liverpool will go on, as they always have. But this moment—this departure—feels weighty. It will shape the next chapter under Arne Slot. Whether it becomes the turning of a page or the closing of a book depends on the choices made now."}

While the broader narrative rightly focuses on the extraordinary success of Slot’s debut campaign, moments like this reveal the nuanced challenges of maintaining a title-winning side—particularly when giving opportunities to younger, fringe players.\n\nDavid Lynch, speaking to Dave Davis for Anfield Index, offered a sharp, honest assessment of two such players—Harvey Elliott and Jarell Quansah. It was a necessary dissection of performances that failed to meet the standard required, especially in a team currently setting the domestic benchmark.\n\nElliott’s Ongoing Struggle to Command Games\n\nHarvey Elliott is a player with immense promise and clear technical ability, yet his transition from promising cameo star to consistent starter remains a work in progress. Lynch did not hold back in his analysis: “I was looking forward to seeing Elliott coming into the team but it was really disappointing… He didn’t create a chance and couldn’t get involved in the game.”\n\nThat quote will sting, but it also sums up the sentiment shared by many observers. Elliott has often looked sharp when coming off the bench—his energy and flair injecting urgency late in games. However, this match exposed the gap between potential and product. There’s a difference between being involved and being influential, and Elliott, on this occasion, was neither.\n\n“The game completely passed him by… You need to prove your worth for more minutes and that just didn’t happen for him.” This is not a dismissal of Elliott’s future, but a sobering reality check. In high-stakes matches—even those with rotated squads—a player of his calibre needs to show why he belongs in the title-winning XI.\n\nQuansah’s Confidence Hit by Systemic Failings\n\nJarell Quansah’s outing was equally turbulent, though arguably less self-inflicted. “Quansah is unlucky because the own-goal is just unfortunate and the penalty he gets set up by a horrendous pass into him.” When a defender is thrust into a shaky backline, errors become more visible, and judgment sharper.\n\nBut sympathy can only go so far. Lynch continued: “There was a lot of uncertainty in his performance… He wins just two out of his six duels, doesn’t complete any of the four long pass attempts.” That inability to assert himself physically and distribute accurately stands out in a team built on defensive control and structured pressing.\n\nSlot’s Liverpool is evolving to include depth and development, but that comes with risk. Quansah’s yellow card—“from losing possession and diving in”—was symbolic of a young player not just having a bad day, but struggling to cope with the demands of a title-winning setup.\n\nSlot’s Challenge of Balancing Progress with Performance\n\nWhat emerges from this analysis isn’t mere criticism—it’s context. When your side is Premier League champion, the margins for error become minuscule. Squad players must not only deputise; they must convince. And that, on this showing, didn’t happen for either Elliott or Quansah.\n\nSlot’s greatest test now might not be winning matches—it will be maintaining hunger and focus in a team already crowned. Developing talent without dropping standards is a tightrope walk. The returns on Elliott and Quansah might still come good, but patience will need to be matched with progression.\n\nCredit to David Lynch and Anfield Index for cutting through sentiment with clear-eyed assessment. This wasn’t about scapegoating—it was about standards. And in this Liverpool side, they’ve never been higher."}

A boyhood fan, a breakout teenage prodigy from Fulham, and a player whose technical skill and attitude aligned perfectly with Jürgen Klopp’s sentimental idealism. But football is a game of systems, not sentiment—and under Arne Slot, Liverpool has shifted from an emotional dynasty to a ruthlessly efficient machine. With ruthless aggression and blinked ideologies often comes silverware, however, sacrifices will always prevail on that pathway to sustained success.\n\nDespite flashes of brilliance and a genuine impact off the bench in recent months, Elliott finds himself on the outside looking in after being such a favourite of his former manager, Klopp. With Mohamed Salah and Dominik Szoboszlai entrenched in the right-sided and central roles that suit them best, the tactical evolution favours physicality, verticality, and defensive resilience. Given the new wants and desires of an unflappable steward, Elliott’s path to consistent minutes has narrowed dramatically. Slot’s football is not unfriendly to technical players—but it demands high-intensity pressing, positional discipline, and physical robustness to ensure all situations are handled appropriately. Qualities that Elliott, for all his flair, cannot consistently deliver at the required level are what have seen him play less than 800 minutes so far this term.\n\nThe above is why, despite no official whispers of discontent, Elliott is increasingly viewed as one of the many saleable assets that could fetch a premium fee—perhaps in the region of £40 million—and help fund Slot’s more physically imposing vision. With Liverpool intensifying their interest in Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, there’s growing talk that Elliott could be offered as a makeweight in a potential part-exchange deal.\n\nThe sentiment may linger, but the professional approach now reigns supreme.\n\nA Shift from Klopp’s Compassion to Slot’s Clinical Vision\n\nIn the Klopp era, Elliott’s growth was seen as a pet project that may eventually see him replace the Egyptian King, Salah. The diminutive playmaker was trusted early, nurtured, and protected by a father-like figure before that role was taken by more of a stepfather coach. The appearances weren’t always given under Klopp, but they felt intentional. There was an ideological space made for him, one that valued loyalty, long-term development, and emotional investment.\n\nThat ideology has now faded and the new dawn appears to be one that does not include this lifelong red. Slot’s arrival, alongside the calculated decision-making of Anfield executives, Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes, has brought a new efficiency to Liverpool’s sporting structure. The question is no longer what could this player become. But how does this player serve the system today? That lens doesn’t favour Elliott and usually points to a next destination, one that could materialize this summer.\n\nWhy Does Harvey Not Fit?\n\nArne Slot’s 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 hybrids reward players who can combine strength with speed, and defensive understanding with vertical aggression. Szoboszlai, who has returned to form in recent weeks, and Salah, whose re-signing looks increasingly possible, dominate the right and central channel around the centre forward of choice, in a way that renders Elliott surplus—no matter how much he loves the badge. Even deeper roles, where he has occasionally deputised, are now earmarked for players like Alexis Mac Allister or a more defensively robust new arrival. The nuance required to work in a double pivot is never going to be something that Elliott can attain, certainly not close to the elite level that is demanded.\n\nIn that context, Harvey Elliott becomes a victim not of failure, but of the evolution of the team. A talented footballer whose style doesn’t align with the hard lines of the new tactical era will eventually become targeted by others looking to bolster their ranks. Liverpool doesn’t need to sell him—but they may decide that they can afford to regenerate the squad in areas that better serve the immediate wants of the head coach. In today’s financial landscape, turning academy investments or low-cost purchases into major transfer returns is part of what sustains elite-level competition and the esteemed Sporting CEO, Michael Edwards, is regarded as an expert in this field.\n\nWhere Next?\n\nThe Premier League may still see Harvey Elliott shine—perhaps in a more expressive system, at a club like Crystal Palace, where a player of his style can become central rather than peripheral, much like Michael Olise when he was excelling as an Eagle.\n\nFor Liverpool, the summer of 2025 will not be remembered for romance or nostalgia. It will be remembered for hard choices that build towards something bigger. And Harvey Elliott’s departure may just be one of the first."}

After weeks of swirling speculation, the 26-year-old confirmed via social media that he will leave the club at the end of the season, ending a two-decade-long journey that took him from Kirkby prodigy to Premier League champion.\n\nBut while the timing of his announcement may be measured, the events leading up to it paint a picture of emotional and psychological turbulence behind the scenes.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, Alexander-Arnold confided in friends that he has no memory of Liverpool’s 2-2 draw with Manchester United in January – a match that came just days after Real Madrid launched a surprise £20 million bid for the full-back. The fallout from that approach may have played a significant role in one of the defender’s worst performances in a Liverpool shirt.\n\n“The La Liga side’s bid had a profound effect on the defender that evening and scrambled his head to such an extent that he fails to recall the events of the match,” the article reveals.\n\nReal Madrid’s Bold Approach\n\nThe Madrid offer, though financially modest by elite standards, sent shockwaves through the Liverpool hierarchy and fanbase. Former Reds defender Jamie Carragher didn’t mince his words, saying:\n\n“They’re bullies, Real Madrid. My problem with it is, they have bid on the back of Trent Alexander-Arnold or his agent saying ‘put a bid in’. Because they wouldn’t put a bid in, they wouldn’t do that unless they get the say so.”\n\nWhile that comment may feel inflammatory to some, it underlines a prevailing sense of betrayal among certain sections of the Anfield faithful. For all his composure on the pitch, it’s clear the off-field noise had begun to seep into Alexander-Arnold’s psyche.\n\nIt was Sporting Director Richard Hughes who reportedly made the first move to check on the right-back’s wellbeing after the game, a gesture that “meant a lot” to him and hinted at the human cost of football’s brutal rumour mill.\n\nEmotional Exit From Boyhood Club\n\nOn Monday, Alexander-Arnold finally broke his silence.\n\n“After 20 years at Liverpool Football Club, now is the time for me to confirm that I will be leaving at the end of the season… This club has been my whole life – my whole world – for 20 years.”\n\nThere was no mention of Madrid in the farewell message. But between the lines, there was clarity: this is not a decision made lightly, nor without emotional weight.\n\n“This decision is about experiencing a new challenge, taking myself out of my comfort zone and pushing myself both professionally and personally.”\n\nThree matches now remain in Trent’s Liverpool journey. It is understood that although no contract has been signed yet, the move to Real Madrid – where he’ll join England teammate Jude Bellingham – is close to completion.\n\nLegacy and Lingered Questions\n\nThe Anfield legacy of Alexander-Arnold is already secure: he revolutionised the full-back role, won every major honour available, and helped Arne Slot secure Liverpool’s long-awaited 20th league title in his debut campaign as manager. But how his departure plays out, and how it will be remembered, remains uncertain.\n\nLiverpool, in their official club statement, struck a respectful tone:\n\n“Alexander-Arnold will depart with our gratitude and appreciation for his contribution during a sustained period of success.”\n\nBut that line sits in contrast to the sting of January’s trauma and speculation that has hovered since December – with Mail Sport being the first to report Madrid’s growing confidence back then.\n\nThere is grace in Trent’s parting words, but wounds – both personal and collective – will take time to heal.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nThis hurts. Not because a player is leaving – that happens – but because of how it’s happened. Trent Alexander-Arnold has been more than a player to us. He’s been ours. A local lad with a Champions League medal, a Premier League title, and a wand of a right foot.\n\nAnd yet this Real Madrid bid – this January madness – cast a shadow. How could the club allow such a moment of vulnerability to go unmanaged? If Trent was that affected that he couldn’t remember a match against our fiercest rivals, where was the support? Where was the line drawn to protect him?\n\nAnd Jamie Carragher’s comments… they’re hard to ignore. If there’s even a fraction of truth to the idea that someone in Trent’s camp encouraged Madrid, it’s a betrayal that stings more than any transfer fee could soothe.\n\nWe love this club. We loved Trent. But maybe we expected more loyalty from a lad who was one of us. His words were beautiful – but they can’t erase the bitterness of seeing him in white, lining up with Bellingham, while we’re left filling a hole that’s more than tactical. It’s emotional."}

They allow us to customize the front and back end of a website, and there are all manner of creative uses for them. Everything from displaying niche content to changing page layouts based on field values is possible.\n\nTraditionally, using custom fields meant navigating obstacles. They require coding knowledge or a plugin to render field data. Implementing them can be time-consuming and out of reach for some users.\n\nThe WordPress Block Bindings API removes some of these limitations. It allows us to “bind” custom field values to a WordPress block. You don’t need a plugin to use them, as the function is built into the Block Editor. Registering fields still requires code, though.\n\nRegardless, using the API is a time saver for developers. Here’s a look at how it works, along with a real-world example.\n\nWhat You’ll Need to Use the Block Bindings API\n\nThe WordPress Block Bindings API streamlines the rendering of custom field data. However, you’ll need a few things to use it:\n\nThe latest version of WordPress;\n\nA theme with a functions.php file or a custom plugin to house your code;\n\nThat’s all there is to it! The API works with both block and classic themes. Use a block theme if you prefer a no-code experience.\n\nWe should also note some of the API’s limitations. As of this writing, it works with the Paragraph, Heading, Button, and Image blocks. Data types are also limited to content, text, URL, etc. Check the documentation for more details.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s see an example of the Block Bindings API in action.\n\nExample: Let’s Bind a Custom Field to a WordPress Block\n\nOur example is an homage to WordPress’ blogging roots. We’ll create a custom field called “Now Playing,” which we’ll fill out on each blog post. The field will contain a favorite song, movie, or TV show of the moment.\n\nWe’ll register the custom field in our theme, add it to the post template, and bind the field to a paragraph block.\n\nWe’re using the Twenty Twenty-Five default block theme. That means we can edit templates with the Site Editor.\n\nStep 1: Register the Custom Field\n\nFirst, we’ll register our custom field by adding code to our theme’s functions.php file. This lets WordPress know that our field is associated with posts.\n\nNote the field’s slug, as we’ll need it later: now_playing\n\nStep 2: Display Custom Fields in the Block Editor\n\nBy default, custom fields aren’t displayed in the Block Editor. So, we’ll have to enable the feature:\n\nOpen a post or page in the WordPress admin. Inside the Block Editor, click on the Options menu (⋮). Click on the Preferences link. Go to the Advanced heading and turn on Custom fields.\n\nWordPress will refresh the screen and display a custom fields UI at the bottom.\n\nStep 3: Add a Custom Field to a Blog Post\n\nNext, we’ll add our custom field to a blog post:\n\nNavigate to Posts > Add New in the WordPress admin. Give your post a title and add content. Scroll down to the Custom Fields area of the editor. Under the Name column, click the Add New button. Enter the custom field slug in the Name field: now_playing In the Value field (right column), enter the name of a song, movie, or TV show. Publish your blog post.\n\nStep 4: Bind the Custom Field to a Block\n\nNow, it’s time to bind our custom field to a block. Since we’re using a block theme, we’ll navigate to Appearance > Editor.\n\nWe want to add custom field data to single blog posts. Inside the Site Editor, click on Templates, then click on Single Posts.\n\nNext, we’ll choose a spot for our custom field in the Single Posts template. Just above the post content seems like a good choice.\n\nAdd a Paragraph block to the chosen spot in the template. Don’t add any content to the block. Select the Paragraph block (click into the block or select it from the List View panel). Click the “+” icon in the Attributes tab on the right column of the editor. Select “content” from the Attributes list.\n\nClick on “content” in the Attributes tab. A list of registered custom fields will appear. Select now_playing from the list. You might also add custom formatting to this area to make the field stand out. We chose the “Subtitle” style from the block settings.\n\nSave the changes you made to the template.\n\nNotice that clicking on the Paragraph block reveals a purple outline. This denotes that the block is bound to a custom data source.\n\nStep 5: View the Result on the Front End\n\nLet’s see how our custom field binding turned out. We’ll visit our blog post to see how it looks.\n\nIt’s working! Our song (“Wonderwall” by Oasis) is displayed above the post content.\n\nThe technical side of our example is done. However, we might want to tweak the styles or add another paragraph that says “Now Playing:” above the field. That would improve the feature’s look and accessibility.\n\nAn Easier Path for Using Custom Fields\n\nUsing WordPress custom fields is easier than ever. The Block Bindings API helps with simple use cases like the one above. It all works within the Block and Site editors.\n\nThat means less hassle for site builders. You don’t have to install a plugin or get tangled up in layers of PHP.\n\nPlus, the feature is expected to evolve. For example, we may see more data types supported and a code-free way to register custom fields. It will be exciting to see what comes next.\n\nFeatures like the Block Bindings API bring WordPress ever closer to a code-free experience. That puts a custom website within everyone’s reach.\n\nWritten by Eric Karkovack Eric Karkovack is a web designer and WordPress expert with over two decades of experience.

She contributed to The Macintosh Bible for its second edition in 1989, served as the lead author/editor for the third edition in 1991, and reprised that role for the 1,000-page seventh edition in 1998. In between, she also wrote The Macintosh Companion: The Basics and Beyond, collaborated on two editions of The PowerBook Companion with her husband Rich Wolfson, edited The Macintosh Dictionary, and penned The Mac Almanac. Throughout the 2000s, she continued as a columnist for Mac magazines, ultimately writing nearly a thousand articles, including one in the final print issue of Macworld.\n\nAlthough mentions of Sharon in TidBITS date back to when I first read The PowerBook Companion (see “Travels with Charley,” 16 November 1992), we began working together around 2006, when she wrote Take Control of Fonts in Mac OS X and its companion volume, Take Control of Font Problems in Mac OS X. She thrived as a Take Control author, writing books about Safari, iBooks, and Numbers, and contributing TidBITS articles on similar topics.\n\nIn other words, Sharon was the real deal. Now let me tell you what made her so special and why we appreciated her so much.\n\nI’ve never met anyone as insatiably curious and communicative about software as Sharon. She didn’t just want to know how an app worked; she wanted to tell everyone about it. She couldn’t open an app without poking at every menu and every button, and then asking, “What happens if you hold down the Option key while…?” Sharon never met a keyboard shortcut she didn’t like, and she lived to unearth those that didn’t reveal themselves in the interface or the app’s manual. One of her greatest frustrations must have been word- and page-count restrictions because she always wanted to tell the reader more—she appreciated writing for TidBITS and Take Control in part because our online-only approach gave us more flexibility on length.\n\nThat style of comprehensive, exhaustive, almost obsessive documentation is largely a thing of the past, thanks to the frequency of software updates and the sheer amount of software available, though I still feel its tug occasionally. I may be projecting, but I think Sharon and I shared its underlying motivation: a desire to explain everything about a topic, to be the person who knew all and could be relied upon to answer any question. It’s about acquiring and sharing that knowledge, though there’s probably also some inherent egotism.\n\nBeyond accuracy and exhaustiveness, Sharon cared deeply about aesthetics in the service of understanding. While most tech writers would take a screenshot of a window or dialog and slap it into their article, Sharon would run everything through Photoshop, cropping out unnecessary bits and combining multiple screenshots to illustrate her points. Zoom into this random spread from The Mac Almanac, with its composed screenshots and whimsical marginalia.\n\nMy praise for Sharon’s work isn’t just in retrospect. In “Heavyweight Book Bout” (27 March 1995), Tonya wrote:\n\nOpen the Mac Almanac, and right away you notice the slightly off-white pages, the unusual (though highly legible) fonts, the numerous fanciful graphics and sidebars, and the overall dreaminess of the design. The Mac Almanac rates as the most beautiful computer book I’ve ever seen. … The Almanac has personality, class, warmth, empathy, and technical depth. It’s well-organized and practical, but it would also make a wonderful gift. Mac Secrets and the Mac Bible are books most any TidBITS reader would enjoy, use, and get a lot out of, but the Almanac stands out as one of the best books I’ve ever had the pleasure of owning.\n\nTonya had no idea that she would later have the opportunity to work with Sharon. As the editor-in-chief of Take Control, Tonya collaborated with Sharon on numerous books over the course of a decade. While editing this piece, she commented that, to Sharon, there was always room for improvement: Sharon labored to ensure that her writing was casual and clear, and that her illustrations were useful and delightful. She knew how to nudge readers into considering slightly more complex workflows that would yield large productivity gains. She would want to be remembered as a writer who set the highest possible standards for accuracy and aesthetics, and who showed the rest of us how to get the most out of our Macs.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that Sharon was a woman in a male-dominated field. The 1980s were a time when a woman’s name on a magazine masthead or tech book was highly unusual. When Sharon first met the editor of MacUser at a show in New York City several months after the magazine’s 1985 debut, he ignored her extended hand, reached into his breast pocket for a camera—film, of course—and took a flash picture of her in the crowded room, saying, “This is to prove to the people back in California that you are not a man.” She wasn’t entirely alone. There was Caroline Rose, who was notable for her role as the principal tech writer behind Apple’s Inside Macintosh documentation (and who later edited Take Control books for us). Slightly later, Robin Williams wrote The Little Mac Book. In what may be a comment on the female approach to the tech world, both Sharon and Robin helped start Macintosh user groups—the New Jersey Mac User Group for Sharon (co-founded with Rich) and the Santa Fe Mac User Group for Robin. We are appreciative.\n\nAnother thing to know about Sharon is that she accomplished much of what she did while dealing with constant pain and disability. She was one of those matter-of-fact people who wasn’t shy about sharing what she was going through—often with excruciating details and amusing anecdotes—but as an explanation, not an excuse or a play for sympathy. Even before we started working with her, she had undergone vertebral fusions, and she once shared an astonishing photo of her hands filled with just some of the stainless steel hardware the surgeon removed from her spine when replacing it with titanium. In 2010, she was further seriously injured when a car, driven by an 82-year-old diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, crashed into her, causing headaches that would plague her for the rest of her life. (In a 2013 email in response to her revelation about the cause of the headaches, I wrote: “I for one firmly believe that spinal fluid should not leak. Ever. Anywhere.”)\n\nBecause of her pain, difficulty sleeping, and inability to sit upright for long, nearly all her writing for us took place in fits and spurts while in bed. Where she had once been one of the faster writers in the Mac technosphere, she appreciated that we could be highly flexible on deadlines. By this time, we were also close friends, though we met in person infrequently and visited her home in New Jersey only once. As the pandemic dragged on, her migraines and vision problems made writing such a superhuman effort that she would propose articles she could never finish—her last TidBITS article was the excellent “Charts in Apple’s Numbers Spreadsheet: Which One When?” (14 October 2021). Her mind was still full of things she wanted to share, even when her body wouldn’t cooperate.\n\nEventually, the cumulative difficulties became overwhelming, and she began a decline that led to her death last week on 26 April 2025. Rich had been keeping us apprised, and he asked us to share the announcement with the Macintosh community of which she had been a significant part for so many years. Of course we agreed.\n\nGoodbye, Sharon. Your work made a difference in the lives of untold Mac users, and you will be missed."}

It’s something far more nuanced — a calculated pivot in a career defined as much by personal ambition as by loyalty.\n\n“This is not an easy decision,” Alexander-Arnold told Liverpoolfc.com in a candid sit-down at the AXA Training Centre. “I’ve been here 20 years now, loved every single minute of it, achieved all my dreams.” That part isn’t hyperbole — 352 appearances, 23 goals, eight major honours and a Champions League and Premier League title to boot.\n\nSlot’s first season at Liverpool has ended with silverware. The club’s trajectory looks promising. So why walk away?\n\n“I feel like I need a change, a new challenge,” he explained. It’s that word again — “challenge” — the coded language of modern footballers who are no longer content to be one-club men if it means suppressing the urge to stretch their identity elsewhere. The game has changed, and Alexander-Arnold is simply evolving with it.\n\nTiming Behind the Decision\n\nCritics will question the timing of the announcement — post-title, pre-lap of honour — but Alexander-Arnold was keen to keep the focus on the pitch.\n\n“I felt personally the focus should always be on the pitch, should always be about the football,” he said. With Liverpool chasing the title until the final weeks, any disruption would’ve felt selfish — and that’s not a label Alexander-Arnold wants to carry.\n\nThis isn’t a saga built on agent whispers or Real Madrid flirtations — at least not publicly. It’s one of those rare footballing farewells that feels orchestrated not by greed or grievance, but maturity.\n\nSlot Factor and Future-Proofing Liverpool\n\nThe trust in Arne Slot was never in doubt. “From the first few moments with the manager, he was a winner,” Alexander-Arnold said. He reaffirmed that staying at Liverpool “was 100 per cent a massive possibility.” That’s telling — and also reassuring to fans wondering whether this is a canary in the coal mine moment for Liverpool’s future.\n\nInstead, it’s an endorsement of Slot and a parting gift. Alexander-Arnold’s exit, painful as it may be, isn’t reactive or cynical. It clears the way for the club to recalibrate — tactically and financially — without the awkwardness of dragging negotiations or a diminished version of a local hero.\n\nReal Madrid’s name hasn’t been uttered, but it’s hovered in the backdrop for years. The lure of the Bernabéu remains football’s most intoxicating call for players looking to test their mettle on a different stage. Should that be his destination, it will be framed as destiny fulfilled rather than betrayal committed.\n\nA Goodbye Rooted in Love, not Rupture\n\nThe overwhelming sentiment in Alexander-Arnold’s farewell was love — “I fell in love with the club from a very, very young age,” he admitted, his voice heavy with emotion. He acknowledged the disappointment that many supporters will feel. “You feel a connection to the players that you watch… I completely understand that the news will disappoint a lot of people.”\n\nHe isn’t ducking accountability. “You can be angry and hurt at me… but I just hope that the lads, the rest of the team, the staff, everyone else is able to feel how good a season this has been.”\n\nFor all the metrics and medals, this is still the kid from West Derby who wanted to win a Premier League at Anfield with fans in the stands. That dream came true, against Tottenham, no less.\n\n“To win it at home at Anfield was a dream of mine,” he said. “Winning a Premier League title for Liverpool at Anfield is something that I’ve pictured over and over in my head.”\n\nNow, a different dream takes over — not because the old one stopped mattering, but because he outgrew it."}

Austin: New Journalism Project, 2025. 476pp, $27.00\n\nIn the days of Campus Movement yore, i.e., the 1960s-70s, Austin, Texas, yielded nothing to San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Madison, Wisconsin or Burlington, Vermont. Its claims upon bohemianism and political resistance had a unique flavor, to be sure. Major university town and state capital, it departed from the other protest-heavy places in one key respect: it was surrounded by Texas.\n\nThe flavor stood out by itself. If left-wing prairie radicalism once prompted an Oklahoma socialist movement larger by proportional vote than anywhere else in the country, a lot of time had passed. And yet, at any national meeting of radicals, Austin men and women, mostly youngsters, prided themselves on their distinctive sensibilities. And their responsibilities: by the middle 1960s, Austin stood not far from major Army camps training young men to go to Vietnam. Thus the GI Coffee House movement, the key connection of the working class and the antiwar movement.\n\nLegendary underground newspaper The Rag—in many ways the most important of all the unofficial press that reached millions of young readers with alternative views of war, politics and culture— found a ready niche here. Or rather, as a founding editor and the long-run project savant Thorne Dreyer says, the niche was created and sustained through herculean efforts. Things never happen by themselves, especially when funds are rare and dependent upon political movements of resistance.\n\nThis astounding book offers a record of the times far beyond the underground press that tanked by the end of the 1970s. The Rag found new forms of communication after its print format death. It operated for decades online and continues now as a radio feature from Austin, with some of the old hands still at the wheels of information and insight. The last regular journalistic piece here ends in 2014, but the “Rememberances” of the vanished comrades and the last salutes to Dreyer and his work offer some important addenda: people pass but the work continues.\n\nThe bulk of this very bulky volume is about radical journalism almost as much as about the world seen by the radical journalist. I had not known that Dreyer, a Texas boy and son of a prominent Houston newspaperman, aspired to be an actor before turning to his life’s work in 1966. The very first pieces in the book establish the tone of his keen and also lean prose thereafter: confrontations of military and pro-war political authorities by young radicals on campus and off, seen from the newspaper office as organizing center. In other words, his journalism was a political project as it could hardly be for anyone in the commercial press. He wastes no adjectives and indulges in no flowery prose. Every sentence counts, and a great many are also fun to read or read again now, looking back on a lively time. Especially to be noted: a tale of Marines attacking SNCC workers and anti-war activists at Hermann Park in Houston; Dreyer’s unique coverage of the massive March on the Pentagon; “A Comprehensive View: The Movement and the New Media,” and finally, “Under Siege: Space City! And the Nightriders.”\n\nDreyer describes the rise of the underground press from a few papers, very notably the Rag itself, into a national network of hundreds of local efforts, some crudely written or printed, some highly sophisticated in every professional respect except….financed by nobody in particular, hawked by volunteers in public venues (starting with the campus), and staffed by amazing amateurs who nevertheless taught themselves to create the most lively and compelling journalism of the age. And not only journalism. Not since the Yiddish-language press of the 1890s had radical papers carried poetry on the first page! Never had a leftwing paper boasted such new and rebellious, wildly creative comic art. And so on.\n\nDreyer made himself an insider in the small crowd that created the Liberation News Service, a shoestring operation that circulated important journalism and entertaining features free of charge each week. The Rag boasted comic artist Gilbert Shelton and his Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, by the 1970s-80s a hit across large parts of Europe. A graduate school dropout who found his way to San Francisco (where he published and largely drew my own initial entry into comic art, Radical America Komiks, in 1969), Shelton popularized the Austin Ambience, if such a thing existed.\n\nDreyer moved on himself, for a few years, to Space City!, the underground newspaper counterpart in Houston, his own home town. He also toured widely, capturing news of the left, mobilization and repression, across the country. He met and interviewed the day’s radical celebrities, including Jane Fonda, later Yippie leader Jerry Rubin, TomHayden, Judy Collins, NFL star Dave Zirin and inevitably Texas’s own Kinky Friedman, among others.\n\nBuilding a community of protest around itself, Space City! managed to survive military-style assaults upon its headquarters by the KKK and others, and ended only in the political exhaustion of the staff. Perhaps, looking back, the great virtue of all the Texas Left was to move on, change forms, find newer generations more usually organized around culture than politics as such. Even Houston, more than college-town Austin, a real Southwestern megalopolis, had a bohemian neighborhood by the 1970s-80s, where artists of various kinds flourished, most especially but not only musicians and singers. Meanwhile, Austin, like Madison and so many other places, has faced extreme gentrification from incoming capital, creating an urban world in which low rents and lazy bohemian afternoons seem to be part of urban memory. And yet Thorne Dreyer persists! And will be heard, we hope, for a long time yet."}

But a number of fixable bugs still soured my experience, capped off by a fairly hefty subscription price. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nBest Prices Today: Sightful Spacetop Bundle\n\nRetailer Price Sightful $899 View Deal Product Price\n\nSightful’s Spacetop, a gigantic augmented-reality supplemental monitor for your PC, succeeds as a concept. But it still needs some fine-tuning before you’ll be completely happy with it, especially at the price Sightful is charging.\n\nSo, what is the Sightful Spacetop experience?\n\nImagine looking through a swim mask at the night sky, made up of a regular grid of small stars. Upon this grid floats a small taskbar and various Windows windows, which you can move around and drag, just like a desktop. Spacetop functions as a massive virtual screen that seamlessly replaces your laptop’s monitor. Look up, down, and to the sides, and you can see your windows and apps. There’s a small floating taskbar for in-Spacetop navigation. You can run Teams or Slack in one corner and Outlook in another since it’s all in Windows. Instead of a swim mask, however, you’re using a pair of XReal augmented-reality glasses.\n\nDoes it work? Absolutely.\n\nHowever, I felt like I was wrestling with the interface as much as using it, which isn’t a strong endorsement. There are workarounds, however. The biggest obstacle to this review, sadly, was probably myself—a product of the pre-PC educational system.\n\nSightful concept art showing what it’s like to use the Spacetop. It’s pretty close to the real thing. Sightful\n\nThe Spacetop bundle: Out of the box and setup\n\nSightful debuted Spacetop in May of 2023, when it was a quasi-headless laptop with the XReal glasses directly built into the device. Since then, Sightful has retooled the device to run as a subscription-based app on top of a new generation of AI PCs and made the Sightful app Windows native. (Before, the Sightful Spacetop was essentially a Chromebook.)\n\nNow, the Sightful Spacetop costs $899, including a pair of $699 XReal Air Ultra 2 AR glasses that serve as the Spacetop display. You’ll need to supply your own AI PC, too. If you fall in love with the Spacetop, you’ll need to pay $200 for a year’s subscription; the bundle already ships with a year’s worth of Spacetop service. That’s a pricey package, in the neighborhood of what Adobe charges per month for Photoshop. At least the glasses are yours to keep, regardless.\n\nSightful asked me to review the Spacetop software rather than write about my experiences with the XReal glasses or the associated laptop. That’s not entirely possible, as it’s a holistic experience.\n\nXReal’s XReal Air Ultra 2 AR glasses, sitting on top of the HP laptop Sightful provided for review purposes. Mark Hachman / Foundry\n\nSightful provided me with an HP AIPC laptop with Spacetop already provisioned upon it. Spacetop’s app appears to be just a Windows app, and Sightful’s representatives said that it can be moved from laptop to laptop just like a normal Windows app. However, I was unable to test the setup process myself.\n\n(“Customers who purchase the Spacetop Bundle receive a link to create an account and download the software (regular MSI installer), then, following the installation, are required to log in once to activate their license on the laptop,” a Sightful representative said when I asked about setup. “If a customer purchased an optical attachment, they get a link to upload their prescription, and the attachment is shipped together with the XReal glasses to them.”\n\nThe optical attachments are just prescription inserts. XReal’s glasses don’t allow room for eyeglasses, but you can ask Sightful to serve as a go-between if you need prescription lenses. Prescription single-lens inserts cost $50, while prescription progressive lenses cost $150. As part of this review, I supplied my prescription to Sightful, which installed prescription lenses. (I’m not sure what will happen if your prescription worsens, or if you want to swap them out for progressive lenses.)\n\nThe Xreal glasses are lightweight and comfortable. Note the prescription inserts. Jennifer Sundberg\n\nXReal’s glasses come bundled, and XReal has no connection to Sightful’s Spacetop other than that. Still, the Air Ultra 2 glasses weigh just 83 grams, and that’s absolutely critical on a device you plan to wear for potentially hours. The glasses felt lightweight, comfortable, and open to the side. They also include small audio speakers.\n\nThat’s comforting in an unfamiliar environment, like a coffee shop, where you’d like to have an awareness of your surroundings. But on a plane or in a hotel room — trusted locations, for which you might buy the Spacetop for working — you might find the gaps to the side a bit distracting. It’s a trade off.\n\nSpacetop: AR as a productivity device\n\nPlug in the XReal glasses, and you’ll see a duplicate of your laptop’s screen, floating in your vision. You’ll need to launch the Spacetop app to get what you paid for: the AR environment, which extends your view about 180 degrees in all directions. If you were to lie on your back and look up, your AR workspace would be about what you could see in the sky above.\n\nXReal’s OLED displays supply 1080p per eye at up to 120Hz, so I didn’t feel like I needed to make any adjustments to the font size or via Windows settings. I could read my Windows apps perfectly well, and any text was legible without needing me to adjust anything. XReal rates XReal Air Ultra 2’s field of view (FOV) at 52 degrees.\n\nI tried to reproduce the familiar environment of my desktop: a large landscape display in the center of my desk, with a second portrait display to one side and my laptop just below. Multiple physical monitors confine you to the space they offer. But Windows does offer Windows Snap, which allows you to quickly align windows in various configurations. Spacetop doesn’t provide this feature, so I had to manually adjust various apps and windows until I achieved the desired alignment. The layout appears to be persistent, though, so there’s that.\n\n(I’d really like to show you what you can see as you’re using Spacetop, but I can’t really show it off. Screenshots don’t really work, though I’ve included one below. Even trying to share your screen via Zoom displays a pair of screens, as both of the XReal’s displays are projected.)\n\nMark Hachman / Foundry\n\nLook up, and the virtual space extends to about your ceiling. On my setup, the “bottom” of the workspace reached the top of my laptop tray in front of me, extending to about 90 degrees to either side. You can adjust the AR display by moving it closer or farther away or tilting it. The little dots that describe the virtual landscape layout don’t always signal how far you can go, but dragging a window to the side will expand the AR space until it can go no further—a bit like adding new tables and charts to an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nIn the center of your screen perches the Spacetop toolbar, which basically stands as a minimalist representation of your Windows toolbar. You can open and launch apps via a Start-like button to the left, access Windows settings, and more. Unfortunately, it just sits there, plopped in the center of your screen, without any easy way to move it around. That becomes a pain when it accidentally blocks part of your windows, which have to be readjusted to accommodate it. Sightful representatives say that the toolbar is not adjustable; I’d say it needs to be.\n\nSpacetop’s toolbar sits plopped in the center of your screen. Yes, you can put windows above and below it, but it seems like it should live somewhere else. Note that the apps menu only pops out when you click on the grid icon, on the left of the toolbar. Mark Hachman / Foundry\n\nThere’s one more interesting twist: travel mode. Let’s say that you’re waiting for an appointment and need to move into a conference room. When used normally, what you see in the Spacetop environment won’t change orientation if you move about. In travel mode, Spacetop syncs the center of its workspace to the way your laptop is facing, helping you to keep everything in its place. I never really thought about it, but it’s a smart idea which works.\n\nIf you get “lost,” a small little icon will show you the location of your mouse cursor. .\n\nGlitches don’t overwhelm Spacetop, but they are there\n\nSpacetop: a gigantic virtual display for your laptop. That’s easy enough to understand. But the road to that experience is bumpier than it needs to be.\n\nI really disliked two things about the Spacetop experience. First, the app provides you a window with your laptop’s desktop in case you need to access any files stored there. I was able to move that screen around, like a window, with absolutely no issues at all. But other windows—a collection of Microsoft Edge browser tabs, for example—sometimes would glitch repeatedly and wouldn’t move.\n\nI challenge anyone to not have to look at their keyboard while navigating these shortcuts! Mark Hachman / Foundry\n\nI think that has to do with being a left-handed user, and possibly that certain elements within the Spacetop environment respected my choice of mouse/taskbar buttons, and others did not. (When I dropped out of the Spacetop environment, the laptop’s trackpad worked as expected for moving apps and windows around.) That drove me mildly insane until I connected a mouse to the laptop. As a left-handed user, I’m not impressed.\n\nSecond, I’m not sure if I triggered a CTRL LOCK function on the laptop, but the application absolutely refused to allow me to type a URL inside Edge until I tapped the CTRL key a few times. (Typing “O” would bring me to a File “Open” function within File Explorer instead.) I solved my issue by tapping the ESC or CTRL keys until the problem went away.\n\nI also encountered a couple of other bugs, including one where the audio would cut out over the XReal speakers unless I adjusted the spatial sound within Windows. In another, a small Favorites window within Edge apparently hooked onto the toolbar and wouldn’t let go. Other popup windows, several of which asked for confirmation, weren’t responsive until I repeatedly tried to interact with them.\n\nNot a glitch, just a restriction. Apparently Spacetop is a connected application. Mark Hachman / Foundry\n\nBut the biggest handicap? Me, unfortunately. What Spacetop instantly exposed was that I’m not the typist I thought I was. I learned typing as sort of a hybrid of two- and multi-fingering, and I work best upon a familiar keyboard. The associated XReal glasses basically block you from looking at your fingers for any reason, so I found that the unfamiliar laptop keyboard caused me to make more errors than usual. I wanted to check my finger placement before I began typing, which the glasses wouldn’t allow me to do.\n\nEventually, I learned to “cheat” by stealing glances down below the glasses to make sure that I wasn’t accidentally tapping the CAPS LOCK key when I was trying to type the characters simply next to it. The issue wasn’t Sightful’s fault. But it still meant that I preferred my traditional laptop keyboard, and I ended up feeling more productive in my everyday work environment.\n\nBut yes, Sightful’s Spacetop can be used to get work done. I previously tried Meta’s implementation of a virtual workspace within Horizon Worlds, and it just didn’t work; the virtual displays were too “far away” and low-resolution that I couldn’t really see myself getting anything done. Spacetop running on top of the XReal glasses works, and I liked it the more I used it.\n\nIs Spacetop better than your home office?\n\nWas using the Spacetop comfortable? Surprisingly so, though I grew into it.\n\nOriginally, I found it easiest to work in quick bursts before I solved some of my pointing issues. As I became more familiar, I worked for longer stretches. I wrote a draft of this review entirely within the Spacetop environment. It was as easy to pull up supplementary documentation in separate windows as it was within a more conventional laptop with multiple monitors. XReal’s glasses provide audio, so I was able to skim a video on the web and jot notes as well.\n\nMy wife burst out laughing when she took this picture, but at least it’s a little less dorky than the Apple Vision Pro or a Meta headset. Jennifer Sundberg\n\nBut there’s definitely some element of fatigue. My eyes grew somewhat tired after a while, and I found I needed to take breaks. I also felt some traces of vertigo on a single occasion.\n\nI think I solved it by adjusting how much light the XReal glasses let in—from nearly black to nearly transparent— all by tapping a button on the glasses. It also makes Spacetop well-suited for both indoor and outdoor work. Over time, the unfamiliar weight of the glasses caused a slight strain on my neck.\n\nAll told, I got to the point I would work for about 45 minutes to an hour at a time. I do think my experience improved over time, and I’m not entirely sure why. I didn’t specifically test how long the laptop battery would last, though I noticed it drop from 48 percent to 21 percent in about 45 minutes, as measured by the toolbar battery meter. Most planes now offer power plugs, so I don’t think this will be an issue.\n\nI still prefer my trusty desktop setup, though plugging in a USB mouse to the laptop made the Spacetop experience significantly better. On the other hand, certain scenarios throw you into situations where you simply don’t have the luxury of working under your preferred conditions, such as on a plane. I didn’t hop a flight to write this review, but I did simply flip off my screens and use my keyboard drawer as a tray table, writing this review under those conditions.\n\nWould I recommend it?\n\nIf I flew to Asia every week, would I find value in the Spacetop? I think I would.\n\nSure, Windows already offers you options to see “more” than just a single screen’s worth of data, especially via the virtual desktop feature that allows you to slide screens’ worth of data back and forth. I do like the option to keep a few lightly used apps off to the side, however, and Spacetop accomplishes that nicely.\n\nIs it all worth $899 plus $200 per year? That’s the real question. For the premium flyer zipping back and forth on a corporate dime, yeah, maybe. But for the average consumer? Probably not. This is a one-trick Apple Vision Pro for the Windows world. A useful trick, yes, but an expensive one."}

One of the key items in the collection was the Wolf Fang Dagger Ballpoint Pen, which proved to be so popular it quickly sold out.\n\nNow, fans of the movie will be pleased to know that the highly sought-after item is back in stock at the chain, looking just as beautiful as it did when it first wowed us three years ago, with etched details to match the look of the dagger seen in the film.\n\nUsed by the film’s titular character, who also goes by the name San, this dagger is first introduced to viewers when fiesty warrior San brandishes it during a tense fight scene against Lady Eboshi.\n\nWhat it lacks in size — it is made from the fang of a magical wolf, after all — it makes up for in speed and precision. As these two things are also handy when writing, you’ll be able to feel the magical assist whenever you use the pen to scribble down your thoughts.\n\nThe pen will look right at home on your desk, especially if you have one of the studio’s Rollbahn notebooks to pair with it.\n\nMeasuring 13 centimetres (5.1 inches) in length, this is a dagger that makes an impact, whether you’re using it as a pen….\n\n▼ …or as a beautiful display piece.\n\nThe only downside to the pen is the ink cartridge isn’t replaceable, so its ability to write is finite. However, with such beautiful design features, the pen bring a smile to your face long after you’ve finished using it, and it can be purchased for 2,310 yen (US$15.88) at Donguri Kyowakoku stores and online, while stocks last.\n\nSource, images: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

And now, her new book called Out of Sight: An Undercover Investigator's Fight for Animal Rights and Her Own Survival, covers her unending courageous journey and offers a deep dive into the meat industry’s treatment of farm animals that truly is \"a story of resilience and, ultimately, professional and personal triumph.\" Gail has been indefatigable in her efforts on behalf of the powerless and voiceless and Out of Sight is a testament to her unwavering empathy and strength in the face of profound obstacles. Here's what she had to say about her long-awaited memoir about her mission for justice.\n\nMarc Bekoff: Why did you write Out of Sight?\n\nGail Eisnitz: I’ve spent decades both in the field documenting violations against farm animals, and in my office preparing cases and writing about my investigations in articles and books. But my efforts to expose and prosecute animal abusers were often thwarted by network television producers and law enforcement authorities. So I decided to write Out of Sight in an attempt to bring awareness to the ongoing issues plaguing the meat industry and, more specifically, the topic of what animals suffer to become food on America’s dinner tables.\n\nBy sharing the challenges I experienced in both documenting and exposing farm animal cruelty, I’m hoping to provide readers with insights into what takes place behind the closed doors of U.S. factory farms and slaughterhouses. By disclosing the personal and professional trials and triumphs I encountered during my investigations, I think I’ve created a storyline that will engage readers as they push through the uncomfortable realities of animal abuse. After all, Americans have a right to know.\n\nMB: How does your book relate to your background and general areas of interest?\n\nSource: Skyhorse Publishing/with permission.\n\nGE: Well, it is very related. I’ve had obsessive compulsive disorder since I was 8 years old, long before OCD was even recognized in the DSM. As severe as my OCD was, it was dwarfed by an undiagnosed visual processing condition that further affected my ability to function. In Out of Sight, my efforts to expose farm animal cruelty take place against a backdrop of that disorder. The diagnosis of that rare neurological disease a mere three years ago—only after I began writing the book—was life changing for me and is revealed at the book’s climax.\n\nThat’s my long way of saying that my private battle with these disorders—the isolation and alienation I experienced—set me up for a lifetime of identifying with helpless beings. It propelled me to spend my life speaking out for the most isolated and alienated among us: farm animals.\n\nAs far as my general areas of interest, I studied natural resource conservation in college as a way to learn about the plights of endangered and other species. Perhaps because of my early struggles, I desperately wanted to rescue animals in distress.\n\nMB: Who do you hope to reach in your interesting and important work?\n\nGE: While my first book, Slaughterhouse, garnered wide support from thousands of animal lovers internationally, Out of Sight was written as a memoir to reach a broader audience, not just individuals concerned with animal issues. It’s my sincerest hope that this book will be of interest to a more general readership, the public at large.\n\nMB: What are some of the topics you consider and what are some of your major messages?\n\nGE: People have a right to know what goes on behind the guard shacks and locked gates of America’s meat packers and factory farms, that which is “out of sight.” Many of the abuses I’ve documented—i.e., mother hogs immobilized for years in cages so small they can never turn around; chickens suffocated by the millions by farmers attempting to control disease spread; runt piglets killed by having their heads smashed on concrete floors—would never be tolerated if they were perpetrated against companion animals like dogs and cats. Yet, by conveniently exempting “standard agricultural practices” from state laws, the livestock industry excuses this brutal behavior and hides it from public consciousness.2\n\nIn Out of Sight, I use six actual animal abuse cases which build upon each other to demonstrate what happens every day in slaughterhouses and factory farms. Readers join me as I document violations and then fight with network television producers to expose them, individuals who invariably conclude that the evidence I had secretly obtained is too disturbing to air on TV. Readers accompany me as I uncover elaborate cover-ups by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and a state governor, and as I clash with state attorneys general in my struggle to obtain prosecutions of animal abusers. They share in my success as a newspaper story I prompt results in an annual multimillion dollar appropriation by Congress for enforcement of the Humane Slaughter Act—the first funding ever allocated for a law that had been on the books for more than forty years. These and many other incidents occur while I contend with my mysterious medical condition and my seemingly endless quest to get to the bottom of it.\n\nMB: How does your work differ from others that are concerned with some of the same general topics?\n\nGE: First, Out of Sight provides an unprecedented look at the meat industry’s treatment of farm animals. Second, by melding my investigative findings with my personal experiences, I take readers on a surprising journey of self-discovery—one in which I move from abject helplessness—much like the animals I investigate – to empowerment.\n\nMB: Are you hopeful that as people learn more about food production they will change their meal plans?\n\nGE: Eating animal products is a personal decision. It is not my job to tell consumers how to think or what choices to make. It is my job to present the facts. And hopefully I do that in an engaging way.\n\nFifty-five years ago, humans slaughtered about 10 billion farm animals annually worldwide. Today, we kill about 10 billion farm animals a year in the United States alone. When members of the public become aware of the practices they are unknowingly and unwittingly subsidizing with their consumer dollars, they will have the tools to make an informed choice."}

Roosevelt said, \"We must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests.\" Rating: About this rating Correct Attribution\n\nA rumor that circulated online in early 2025 claimed former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, \"We must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests.\"\n\nFor example, on Feb. 15, author, professor and former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich posted the quote on Bluesky. The next day, he shared it on Facebook, Threads and X. Days later, in a Feb. 21 Instagram post, he posted it once more, adding a caption referencing President Donald Trump's second administration. The caption read, \"A warning that sadly rings as true today as it did back then.\" In past years, Snopes readers also asked in emails about the authenticity of the quote.\n\nAccording to numerous historical records, Roosevelt indeed once warned, \"We must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests.\"\n\nReich published the quote on his social media accounts after railing against Trump, his government efficiency adviser, tech billionaire Elon Musk, and Vice President JD Vance, in a series of Substack articles. Reich asserted that Trump, Musk, Vance and other members of the administration had participated in a coup to enrich themselves financially in the pursuit of an oligarchy.\n\nWeeks later, Reich marked the end of Trump's first 100 days with an article The Guardian published, reading, \"If leaders stay silent, the U.S. won't survive Trump's next 100 days.\"\n\nReich had not yet responded to an emailed request for comment as of the time of publication, including additional thoughts he might have both on Roosevelt's usage of the quote and what the words meant to him more than two-and-a-half months later. The White House had also not yet replied to an email asking for comment on Reich's usage of the quote and the outlined claims from Reich's articles.\n\nThe context and meaning of Roosevelt's remark\n\nRoosevelt delivered the in-question quote just days before beginning his third term, during his now-famous \"Four Freedoms\" speech, originally a State of the Union address, on Jan. 6, 1941. As proof of the quote's authenticity, at least dozens of newspapers published on the same day featured the line from his speech. The U.S. National Archives hosts a webpage with a transcript of Roosevelt's full address, including the following introduction:\n\nIn his 1941 State of the Union address to Congress, with World War II underway in Europe and the Pacific, FDR asked the American people to work hard to produce armaments for the democracies of Europe, to pay higher taxes, and to make other wartime sacrifices. Roosevelt presented his reasons for American involvement, making the case for continued aid to Great Britain and greater production of war industries at home. In helping Britain, President Roosevelt stated, the United States was fighting for the universal freedoms that all people deserved. At a time when Western Europe lay under Nazi domination, Roosevelt presented a vision in which the American ideals of individual liberties should be extended throughout the world. Alerting Congress and the nation to the necessity of war, Roosevelt articulated the ideological aims of the war, and appealed to Americans' most profound beliefs about freedom. In his \"Four Freedoms\" speech, Roosevelt proposed four fundamental freedoms that all people should have. His \"four essential human freedoms\" included some phrases already familiar to Americans from the Bill of Rights, as well as some new phrases: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. These symbolized America's war aims and gave the American people a mantra to hold onto during the war.\n\nRoosevelt's speech forcefully opposed isolationism and proposed a \"swift and driving increase in our armament production\" to support British forces. Later in the address, he voiced his opposition to dictators — the moment Reich would highlight more than 84 years later:\n\nTherefore, as your President, performing my constitutional duty to \"give to the Congress information of the state of the Union,\" I find it, unhappily, necessary to report that the future and the safety of our country and of our democracy are overwhelmingly involved in events far beyond our borders. Armed defense of democratic existence is now being gallantly waged in four continents. If that defense fails, all the population and all the resources of Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia will be dominated by the conquerors. Let us remember that the total of those populations and their resources in those four continents greatly exceeds the sum total of the population and the resources of the whole of the Western Hemisphere-many times over. In times like these it is immature--and incidentally, untrue--for anybody to brag that an unprepared America, single-handed, and with one hand tied behind its back, can hold off the whole world. No realistic American can expect from a dictator's peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion -or even good business. Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors. \"Those, who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\" As a nation, we may take pride in the fact that we are softhearted; but we cannot afford to be soft-headed. We must always be wary of those who with sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal preach the \"ism\" of appeasement. We must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests. I have recently pointed out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into our very midst the physical attack which we must eventually expect if the dictator nations win this war.\n\nEleven months and one day later — on Dec. 7, 1941 — the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, then a U.S. territory. On the next day, Roosevelt delivered a speech before Congress in which he famously called the attacks \"a day which will live in infamy\" and declared war on Japan.\n\nCongress approved Roosevelt's request by a vote of 388-1 in the House and 82-0 in the Senate. U.S. Rep. Jeannette Rankin, R-Mont., a dedicated pacifist and the first woman elected to Congress, cast the only vote against the declaration of war."}

She calls herself a “Texas Republican” and served as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas under President Donald Trump, confirmed in late 2017.\n\nBut like many Trump-era appointees, she quickly revealed herself as just another creature of the swamp. Republican voters shouldn’t trust her.\n\nCox, whose family roots run deep in Texas Republican politics, expects to glide into a federal judgeship without scrutiny.\n\nCox is now one of nearly two dozen candidates seeking a federal judgeship in North Texas. Her record deserves scrutiny.\n\nIn the aftermath of January 6, she issued a statement condemning the protesters — without acknowledging that every person who died that day supported Trump. “Forcibly storming a government building is a reprehensible betrayal of the rule of law,” she wrote. In a post amplifying her statement, she added, “Those who committed violence in Washington today are anarchists, not patriots. They should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\nCox has never addressed the growing body of evidence that contradicts the official January 6 narrative.\n\nShe stepped down from her post just two days later, on Jan. 8, 2021. Although her resignation had been announced in December and wasn’t formally tied to the events at the Capitol, the timing still raises questions. She claimed she was making way for a Biden appointee — a routine move when the presidency changes hands. Even so, the context matters.\n\nOn Jan. 7, the day before she left office, Cox filed a controversial deferred prosecution agreement in the case involving Boeing’s 737 MAX crashes, which killed 346 people. The deal shielded Boeing executives from criminal charges and didn’t require a guilty plea. Columbia Law Professor John Coffee called it “one of the worst deferred prosecution agreements I have seen,” and “without precedent.”\n\nBoeing’s criminal defense team included Mark Filip, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis.\n\nJust months later, in June, Cox joined the same firm — now a partner herself. In plain terms: She let one of Kirkland’s clients off the hook, then took a job at the firm.\n\nKirkland hasn’t exactly been friendly to Trump or his policies. During his first term, the firm provided pro bono representation to asylum seekers, migrants, and others held in ICE detention. They actively opposed the administration’s “family separation” policy.\n\nThat section of their website has vanished. Only archived versions on the Wayback Machine remain, and even those appear to have been pulled sometime around March.\n\nThe firm also fought Trump’s efforts to end DACA, offering free legal services to recipients and filing lawsuits on their behalf. Like the rest, that work has disappeared from their website. The same goes for their involvement in lawsuits challenging Trump’s so-called “Muslim ban,” as reported by the legal blog \"Above the Law.\"\n\nIn the end, Trump may have had the last laugh, but Cox’s career trajectory speaks volumes.\n\nKirkland would later cut a deal with the second Trump administration in April to provide $125 million worth of pro bono legal services to avoid punitive executive orders and resolve investigations by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission into the firm’s DEI practices.\n\nMeanwhile, Cox’s husband, John “Trey” Cox, has donated extensively to Democrats over the past decade. Here are some lowlights:\n\nThese donations, some as recent as 2023, paint a clear picture: This is not a household aligned with Republican priorities. Yet Cox, whose family roots run deep in Texas Republican politics, expects to glide into a federal judgeship without scrutiny.\n\nRepublicans can’t afford that mistake.\n\nCox’s condemnation of January 6 protesters, her husband’s funding of judges who undermine conservative goals, and her post-resignation alignment with a firm hostile to Trump all signal the same thing: She’s not on our side.\n\nShe may be one of nearly two dozen candidates for the North Texas seat — but her record should take her out of the running."}

There’s also Jakku. And Jedha. And Geonosis. And Pasaana. And… You know what? We’re not looking at any desert worls where Jedi have set foot today. Instead, for this week’s Minifig Monday we’re looking at original designs from the worlds of fantasy, literature, history, and military sci-fi.\n\nLeading us into the desert today is Jacob Manahan, whose Akhanii desert elves are an imagined ancient kingdom from which civilization flowed. Jacob selects a nice assortment of printed body parts with folds of cloth and timeless jewelry (and I see Horizon‘s Aloy split across two different figures). Those blue eyes suggest the presnce of a certain spice on this world…\n\nSpeaking of Spice, builders Parker (lego.frenzy) and Woudt (_standaartwoudt_) recently collaborated on a series of fig builds based interpreting the characters of Frank Herbert’s Dune, without leaning the official figures from the excellent Dune Atreides Royal Ornithopter. Parker’s series leads with this ensemble. I love the choice of the Haunted Mansion employee for Paul’s sullen face. The Sardukar soldier is epic and menacing. Parker even slips in a brilliant mini-build with that innovative Sandworm maw made from light nougat shields clipped in a ring.\n\nWoudt’s spin on the characters have a very different look reminiscent of the 1980s version of the film from David Lynch. I especially like the builder’s take on Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.\n\nWoudt is no stranger to DUNE creations. This take on Leto II is as inspired as it is grotesque. Please, Denis Villeneuve, don’t stop with a trilogy! We need the God Emperor!\n\nSpeaking of God Emperors, Hakan (the.lego.detective) also created this omnipotent human-sandworm hybrid that evokes the trippy cover art of the original release.\n\nBefore this beomes a God Emperor of Dune appreciation post, let’s move on… to Ancient Egypt! Expansion Bricks provides a pair of historically grounded fig builds, starting with this well-toned Medjay. Their historical reality is complicated, but in pop culture, Medjay are basically the Pharaoh’s special forces.\n\nThe builder also assembled a pair of corrupt Egyptian priests who go by the Jackal and the Falcon, the latter sporting Jaffar’s minifigure head. An excellent assortment of accessories has me feeling very nostalgic.\n\nbeyondb0nes joins the deset caravan with this pair. On the left, Cataphract Ardashir the Protector is inspired by the Sassanid Persian Empire and wears armor mixing viking and Ninjago elements. Prince Hassan ibn al-Nurani draws from the Abbasid Caliphate and wears Jaffar’s iconic headpiece.\n\nRed Impala has created sci-fi soldiers for every terrain, but especially like this desert ensemble, designated Squadron Vanta-7. The heavy units are wearing Resistance Trooper helmets and pack some incredible brick-built armaments. The drone is a great design too, making good use of wagon wheels.\n\nBot builder extraordinare zakar.ion closes out our desert excursion with this pair of Badland wanderers. Robots and proto-humans like these are created by nomadic villagers and given sentience by a strange substance endemic to the desert world.

Apple lawsuit resulted in a court order enjoining Apple from anti-steering activities — that is, hindering developers from telling users to make purchases outside of the app. The case was revived last year when Epic Games alleged that Apple had violated that court order. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers not only agreed with Epic Games but also found that Apple’s Vice President of Finance, Alex Roman, had lied under oath and referred the matter to the district’s federal prosecutor for potential criminal investigation. The judge additionally sanctioned Apple for “misuse of attorney-client privilege designations to delay proceedings.”\n\n‎\n\nMacDailyNews Take: Clearly, Apple must appeal this nonsensical ruling which essentially orders to company not to charge for advertising within its App Store.\n\n‎\n\nPlease help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

The movie opens with protagonist Mahito’s mother dying in a fire, and his struggles to cope with the ensuing trauma include a scene of graphic self-harm…oh, and that’s just part of what happens before he travels to another world filled with monsters hungering for human flesh and looming cataclysmic threats.\n\nBut The Boy and the Heron is an emotionally complex film, and that means there’s space for moments of playful cuteness too, with the most memorable such scenes involving the warawara.\n\nLike just about everything in The Boy and the Heron, there are multiple aspects to the warawara, but in terms of appearance, there’re no two ways about it: the little guys are absolutely adorable. So adorable that you might find yourself wanting to take one with you wherever you go, which is an option thanks to Ghibli specialty shop Donguri Kyowakoku’s recently restocked line of warawara keychains.\n\nMeasuring six centimeters (2.4 inches) in length, the little guys come in three different poses, with this one being the most roly-poly of the bunch.\n\nThis one, meanwhile, has what’s sure to be an infectious smile…\n\n…and the last design has perhaps a touch of trepidation in its face, which, given the fact that no one has an entirely easy life in The Boy and the Heron, not even the warawara, is entirely keeping with the movie’s themes.\n\nSpeaking of the difficulties life throws at us, it’s no doubt going to be tough for some fans to pick between the three. Thankfully, their price of 1,320 yen (US$9.10) means that it shouldn’t be too hard to carve out some space in your budget if you can’t choose just one, and the whole trio is available through the Donguri Kyowakoku online store here.\n\nSource: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\nTop image: Studio Ghibli\n\nInsert images: Studio Ghibli, Donguri Kyowakoku (1, 2, 3)\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?
