Across the square, construction crews rebuild a centuries-old palace complex, and that's where politician Akos Hadhazy guides a tour of his own. \"We are at the Buda Castle, and if you're looking for a symbolic place for corruption, power and the waste of public money, this is a beautiful venue for that,\" Hadhazy says as a Chinese tour group shuffles by.\n\nHadhazy, who works as a veterinarian, is an independent member of Hungary's parliament. He routinely gives tours showcasing what he and many critics allege is the corruption of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The offices for the prime minister and his cabinet used to be down there next to the parliament building,\" he continues, pointing to Budapest's other big pointy-towered tourist attraction in the distance, across the river. \"But Orban decided he wanted to move here, into a castle. Even Matyas Rakosi, Hungary's most brutal communist dictator, refused to move his office here, but Orban wants to play king, so the national gallery will eventually need to be moved out of the castle to make way for him.\"\n\nAll this construction, Hadhazy says, motioning to the cranes towering above the hilltop, represents Orban's gifts to cronies in the form of lucrative contracts while ensuring Orban can survey his \"kingdom\" from above the capital.\n\nOrban, 61, is in his fourth consecutive term as prime minister. In that time, he and his allies have dismantled democratic checks and balances, taken control of the country's media, civil society and universities, and consolidated power in himself and his Fidesz party. The dismantling of Hungary's democracy is a point of fascination for political scientists around the world — including those advising the Trump administration.\n\ntoggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nBut Hadhazy says the Hungarian prime minister is an easy read. \"It's not like Orban is a genius politician,\" he says. \"He received his sheet music from Vladimir Putin, who came into power when oil prices were high, and he channeled that money into oligarchs and in return they bought up Russia's independent media. Orban franchised that model here in Hungary, except he used European Union funds.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOrban targets the media\n\nThe EU began freezing those funds in 2022, but not before Orban and loyal associates took control of much of the country's media.\n\nWhen the Fidesz party regained power in 2010, \"the first target was the media,\" explains Hungarian investigative journalist Andras Petho. \"Literally the first legislation that they introduced to the parliament was the media law, which, at first, was about redesigning the media regulatory system.\"\n\nPetho, who now runs the investigative reporting center Direkt36 in Budapest, says Orban's government was quick to approve any business deal by those close to Orban who wanted to take over media companies. At the same time, Petho says, Orban changed the structure of Hungary's public media outlet, allowing the government to purge the institution of anyone deemed unfriendly to the government.\n\nPetho's former employer Origo, a digital news site, was also sold to a company owned by the son of the then-central bank governor, who, Petho says, eventually turned it into a propaganda site. \"The publisher started coming to us with really unusual requests, asking us to remove articles from the website, and when we tried to push back, things escalated pretty quickly.\"\n\ntoggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nPetho says he and many others in Origo's newsroom resigned.\n\nWhat's left of Hungary's free press can be found in nooks and crannies that dot the capital. In a tiny apartment in central Budapest, a few dozen journalists from what used to be prominent newspapers that were, one-by-one, forced to shut down by Orban's government have formed their own newspaper — Magyar Hang, or Hungarian Voice.\n\n\"Nobody was brave enough to print in Hungary, so we have to find a printing company outside the country,\" says Csaba Lukacs, managing director of the weekly paper. \"Our newspaper is printed in Slovakia in Bratislava, so we have to organize each week the transportation of the paper.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHungarian Voice is funded almost entirely through subscriptions, says Lukacs. He says it's the only conservative paper in Hungary that isn't part of the state propaganda apparatus. \"We are not receiving advertising even from multinational companies,\" he says, \"because they are afraid they will be punished by the tax authorities or somebody else, and our journalists are not allowed to go to the government press conferences.\"\n\nLukacs says the government has stripped away press freedom in a step-by-step process over the years.\n\n\"We are not yet in Turkey, because the journalists will not be jailed yet,\" he says. \"We are not in Russia because nobody is falling out from the windows yet. But day by day we are getting closer.\"\n\nPressure on Hungary's universities\n\n\"What are the characteristics of a dictatorship,\" asks professor Agnes Kende to her students, mostly middle-aged adults at a night class inside a sleek room in Central European University's Budapest campus.\n\n\"One person controls power with their family,\" offers Éva Turonyi, a retired healthcare assistant.\n\n\"Very good,\" says Kende, writing the point on the board.\n\n\"In a dictatorship, the power is centralized, while in a democracy, it's more fragmented,\" says Andrea Kovacs, an assistant at a local construction company.\n\n\"Great, centralized power,\" echoes Kende.\n\n\"In a dictatorship, elections are made irrelevant,\" offers one of the only men in the class, Jeno Bak.\n\n\"Interesting point,\" says Kende. \"Let me ask: Does anyone in a dictatorship have the right to vote?\"\n\ntoggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nBak, in his 60s, shoots up his hand and Kende calls on him. \"I had the right to vote, even in the Kadar era,\" he says, referring to communist dictator Janos Kadar, who ruled Hungary for 32 years during the Cold War. \"It didn't have much of a point because you only could pick from a single option. We acted out the 'democracy.' \"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAfter the brainstorming session, the class breaks into small groups, where they analyze key speeches delivered by Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and other dictators throughout modern history. The class is part of the Socrates Program at Central European University, one of the few programs still offering classes at the institution's Budapest site. CEU was forced to move its degree programs from Budapest to a new campus in Vienna after Orban's government pushed a law through parliament in 2017 that changed rules for foreign universities operating in Hungary.\n\n\"In spite of everything,\" says CEU Budapest Pro-Rector Laszlo Kontler, \"we are determined to continue useful work here with all civil society stakeholders, academic partners that have been accumulated over three decades, and with whom the connections are not completely lost.\"\n\nKontler, a history professor, says Orban's government has not only forced out foreign universities like CEU, but in the 2010s, it took over state universities by appointing chancellors who had a wide scope of authority over the institutions' finances. \"So that's one step,\" Laszlo says, \"if you will, against the academic autonomy of institutions.\"\n\ntoggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nAnother step, he says, was, under the direction of Orban, state universities \"were privatized in a very particular way\" — placed under the direction of boards that were packed with individuals close to Orban's Fidesz party. \"They have been promised to be put on a financially more viable footing in exchange for accepting basically control or surveillance by a combination of individuals and forces close to the government,\" explains Laszlo.\n\nThe institutions that accepted this government control include some of Hungary's oldest and largest universities such as Corvinus University, Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design, and Semmelweis University.\n\n\"There are excellent academics who are doing academically credible work at these universities as well,\" Kontler points out, \"but still, there are strange things happening, which, if one puts it together, cannot be regarded as anything else than an infringement on academic authority.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Trump went further in two months than Orban could in 15 years\"\n\nThis year, faced with an increasingly unified opposition in parliament that has rallied behind charismatic lawyer and politician Peter Magyar, Orban's attacks on media, civil society and freedom of assembly have gained momentum. On March 15, in a speech commemorating Hungary's 1848 revolution against the Habsburg empire, Orban said, \"We are dismantling the financial machine that has used corrupt dollars to buy politicians, judges, journalists, bogus civil society organizations and political activists.\"\n\ntoggle caption Balint Szentgallay/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nHe called these groups stink bugs who have \"survived the winter\" and need to be eradicated. \"If there is justice, and there is, there is a special place in hell for them,\" Orban said.\n\nPolitical scientist Peter Kreko says Orban is targeting the last bastions of Western democracy in Hungary. \"Orban just thinks that the West is unable to survive and the democratic and liberal practices of the West have weakened the West,\" he says.\n\nKreko has mapped out the 15-year process Orban has taken to dismantle Hungary's democracy. Orban began, he says, by weakening Hungary's courts, filling them with loyalists. He then applied pressure on media companies, either turning them into state propaganda or putting them out of business. Then, says Kreko, Orban took control over universities, appointing leaders loyal to him.\n\nKreko says Orban focused on ridding Hungary of any institution capable of checking his power, and he says he sees similarities to how President Trump is carrying out his second term in office. The difference, says Kreko, is the pace at which Trump is operating. \"I think Trump went further in two months than Orban could in 15 years,\" observers Kreko. \"In the United States, it reminds me of a constitutional coup, where everything happens very rapidly.\"\n\nIn public speeches, Trump has called Orban \"fantastic,\" \"respected\" and said \"nobody is a better leader\" than the Hungarian prime minister. And while Orban has boasted that his party has shared his strategies with Trump advisers, Kreko doubts the help was very meaningful. He says Hungary serves as more of a conservative fantasyland that MAGA Republicans can aspire to. \"So: Hungary as the country where you don't have immigrants, where you don't have woke issues, where gender ideology is not that dominant,\" says Kreko, \"and where family values are strong. So this is clearly a construction of Hungary that has nothing to do with reality.\"\n\ntoggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nHe says that's because Hungary is surrounded by Europe and its open society. Budapest's annual Pride Parade, one of Europe's largest, is now in the Hungarian government's crosshairs. In March, it pushed a new law through parliament that banned any assembly that \"promotes homosexuality,\" asserting it was needed to \"protect children.\" On April 14, the parliament voted to amend the country's constitution with similar language.\n\nAt a café in Budapest, Pride Parade spokesperson Johanna Majercsik says this new law will likely go further than banning the pride parade. \"If the government succeeds in banning such a peaceful protest, that means that in the future they will be able to ban or restrict any other peaceful event, any other peaceful demonstration organized by [other] social groups,\" she says.\n\nMany other Hungarians agree. After the public assembly law passed in March, tens of thousands of people halted traffic and bridges in the capital in what have become weekly protests in Budapest. Critics of the law and the new constitutional amendment say Orban is using the LGBTQ+ community as a tool to shut down the right of Hungarian citizens to freely assemble in peaceful protests, particularly at a time when the opposition to Orban's rule is beginning to gain momentum.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut political analysts say Orban, nearing the end of his fourth consecutive term, appears to be, yet again, adapting his step-by-step strategy to hold on to power for as long as he can.\n\nMate Halmos contributed reporting to this story from Budapest."}

In other words: The human person is not a mere individual, relatively expansive, with some philanthropic feelings!\n\n\"The human person is a subject with dignity who, through the constitutive relationship with all, especially with the poorest, can gradually mature in his identity and vocation.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nVance took to X to write: \"I’m grateful every day for this job, but particularly today where my official duties have brought me to Rome on Good Friday. I had a great meeting with Prime Minister Meloni and her team, and will head to church soon with my family in this beautiful city.\n\n\"I wish all Christians all over the world, but particularly those back home in the US, a blessed Good Friday.

Then, I treated them like a magic spell—I'd use some of the common ones and simply copy how they're used in the documentation. And each time I tried to learn how they work, I'd give up pretty quickly.\n\nBut eventually, I got there. And once I finally understood how decorators work, my reaction was, \"Is that it?\" As with many complex topics, the magic goes away once you get it, and what's left makes perfect sense.\n\nSo, let me take you on a journey similar to the one I took to demystify decorators.\n\nI split this decorator quest into seven parts. This article covers Parts 1 and 2. These are the most important parts to understand decorators. Take your time. Parts 3 to 7 are in a separate article soon.\n\nDecorators are powerful for adding reusable functionality to functions without the need to define a new function. You’ll see them often in Python, and you may even need to write your own one at some point.\n\nPart 1 • Closures\n\nPart 1 introduces one of the main characters in this story—closures. We'll get to decorators in Part 2 later in this article.\n\nLet's say you want to keep track of all the arguments you pass to all the calls to print() throughout your code. And no, you don't want to have to do this manually. You want your code to automatically keep a record of any argument you use when you call print() .\n\nStart by defining a new function to replace the built-in print() . Although you could name this new function print , I'll add a trailing underscore in this example to keep the code focused on what really matters. First, here's a version that won't work as intended—the code runs without errors but doesn't achieve the result you need:\n\nAll code blocks are available in text format at the end of this article • #1 • The code images used in this article are created using Snappify . [Affiliate link]\n\nThe new print_() function calls the built-in print() , but it also appends the argument to a list named data . Look for the trailing underscore in this article whenever I write print_ or print !\n\nHowever, data is defined within the function definition. Therefore, data is a local variable. It exists only when you call the function and while the program executes it. It cannot be accessed from anywhere else in the program. This variable is local to each function call.\n\nThe code creates a new list each time you call the function. That won't work. You need a single list that contains all the arguments you pass to all the print_() function calls.\n\nA second option is to define the list data outside the function definition:\n\nThe list data now exists in the global scope. And a function can access names defined in the global scope. Therefore, this solution works. Here's the output from this code:\n\nI love Python ...and also The Python Coding Stack ['I love Python', '...and also The Python Coding Stack']\n\nThe list data now holds a record of all the arguments you pass to print_() .\n\nThis works. However, there are some drawbacks to this solution. The list data exists in the global scope and, therefore, can be accessed from anywhere in the code. There's the danger that another part of your code tries to access and modify this list, leading to bugs and unexpected behaviour:\n\nThe list data now includes an object that's not been used as an argument in print_() :\n\n['I love Python', '...and also The Python Coding Stack', 'Oops, modified globally!']\n\nYou want to eliminate this risk.\n\nAlso, you can only use this list with one function, the function print_() . If you want to keep track of arguments passed to other functions, you'll need to create a separate list with a separate name for each function.\n\nIn the first (wrong) solution above, data was local to the function. In this solution, data is global. Ideally, we need something in between these two options.\n\nCreating a closure\n\nLet me show the current version of the code again, but I'll visually highlight the function's scope:\n\nThe ideal solution for this problem—the in-between solution in which data is neither local nor global—encloses the list data along with the function's local scope. Here's a visual representation of what we'd like to achieve:\n\nIf we could create such a bubble or enclosure that includes the function's local scope and data , the function would still have access to data even though it's not a local variable. But the rest of the code won't be able to access and modify data .\n\nYou can achieve such an enclosure by defining another function. Here's the first step—we'll make some additions later:\n\nHere are the changes from the earlier code block:\n\nYou enclose the original function and the definition of the list data within a new function called print_with_memory() You rename the function print_ as inner to clarify that this is an inner function, nested within an outer one For now, you comment out the final lines since print_() , the function with the trailing underscore, doesn't exist (yet)\n\nThe outer function, print_with_memory() , has two local names: data and inner . However, there's a more interesting observation we can make about this code:\n\nThe function inner also has access to the variable data .\n\nA function defined within another function—an inner function—also has access to variables defined within the enclosing function. So, inner() also has access to names defined in print_with_memory() . This is called a closure.\n\nClear? Does it all make sense?\n\nNo, I didn't think so. So let me add a bit more. When you define a standard function—one that has no nesting, like print_() earlier—the function has access to variable names defined in the global scope. A function has access to global variables, but the global scope can't access local variables defined in functions.\n\nA closure does the same thing but with an extra layer of nesting. The inner function, such as inner() , has access to variables defined in the scope just outside of it—the enclosing scope defined by the outer function print_with_memory() . However, the function print_with_memory() doesn't have access to the inner function's local variables. And the global scope doesn't have access to any names defined either within print_with_memory() or inner() .\n\nReturning the inner function\n\nLet's look at all the names you created in the latest version of the code.\n\nThe outer function, print_with_memory() , has two local variables:\n\ndata\n\ninner\n\nThe name of the inner function is also a name defined within the function. Therefore, the name inner is local to the function print_with_memory() . We'll return to this point shortly.\n\nThe inner function, inner() , has one local variable, some_obj . This local variable is the parameter you define in the function's signature. Parameters are assigned values when you call the function, and therefore, they're local variables.\n\nThe inner function, inner() , also has access to the outer function's local variable, data . This is the closure concept we discussed earlier.\n\nIf you compare your current version of the code—which includes the outer function print_with_memory() and the inner function inner() —with the previous version that only had one function, print_() , you'll note that it's the inner function inner() that performs a similar task to the print_() function in the first version.\n\nYou need inner() to be accessible in the global scope. You can achieve this by returning inner from print_with_memory() :\n\nThe outer function now returns the inner function. Note that you don't call inner within print_with_memory() . There are no parentheses. Instead, you return the function by using just its name without parentheses.\n\nIn the global scope, you can now call print_with_memory() . This function returns another function—the inner function. You assign this inner function to the name print_ in the global scope. This is the same name you used in the first version of this code earlier.\n\nTherefore, you can now use print_() to print objects and also keep a record of all the arguments passed to print_() . And the function print_() is the inner function inner() returned by print_with_memory() . There's a lot of juggling of functions around in this topic!\n\nRight, so the function print_() now has access to the list data , which is defined in print_with_memory() . Recall that this is the characteristic of a closure, which you create when you define an inner function within an outer function.\n\nAnd each time you call print_() , the function will have access to the same list data . There's only one list data even when you call print_() several times. The list data is attached to the function object print_ and isn't created when you call print_() . It's already there.\n\nSince separate calls to print_() can access the same list data , closures allow calls of a function to communicate with previous and future calls through objects within the closures, such as data in this example.\n\nSo, how can you access this list if you need to see what's inside it? You'll deal with this properly in Part 2, but here's a hard way of accessing data through print_ . First, let's look at the .__closure__ attribute:\n\nNote that I'm using the standard built-in print() in the final line rather than the new print_() version.\n\nThe output shows that the function print_ has one element in its closure:\n\n(<cell at 0x1006e96c0: list object at 0x1006377c0>,)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the closure is attached to the function object— print_ without parentheses—and not the function call.\n\nThe output is a tuple that contains only one element—note the trailing comma, which shows that this is a tuple. You can try adding a second local variable in print_with_memory() and then referring to that second variable within inner() . You'll see that .__closure__ will contain two elements.\n\nIn our case, there's only one element in .__closure__ and, therefore, you can access it by indexing .__closure__ using the index 0 :\n\nThis now gives the cell object rather than a tuple containing the cell object. Don't worry about what a cell object is—it's not relevant to our discussion:\n\n<cell at 0x1010c16c0: list object at 0x10100f7c0>\n\nAll you need to know is that you can show the value using .cell_contents :\n\nThis shows the list that contains all the arguments used in all the calls to print_() :\n\n['I love Python', '...and also The Python Coding Stack']\n\nIt's hard to get to this data. But that's a good thing. You don't want the data shared by all the calls to print_() to be easily accessible.\n\nHowever, you'll see that you don't usually need to access this data directly using .__closure__ . But more on this later in this series.\n\nWe're at the end of Part 1 in this journey through decorators, and we haven't even mentioned decorators. Don't worry. We'll get to them soon. First, let's wrap up Part 1 with a few summary-type observations:\n\nA closure allows a function to access variables that aren't in its local scope or in the global scope. A closure has access to the enclosing scope and, therefore, to variables defined in the enclosing (outer) function when creating the closure.\n\nA closure permits some data to persist when you call a function. Therefore, each call of the function can \"communicate\" with previous and future calls of the same function.\n\nGreat. Time to talk about decorators now. Closures have other uses in programming, but I introduced them here as they're central to the discussion on decorators, which is what I'll focus on!\n\nPart 2 • Introducing Decorators\n\nLet's look at the code you have so far:\n\nThe outer function print_with_memory() creates a \"new version\" of the built-in print() function and adds some extra functionality. It decorates the print() function—the adornment, in this case, is the ability of the main program to keep track of all the arguments passed to the new function.\n\nThis code already has many of the hallmarks of a decorator, but let's make a few changes to make it a proper decorator. The first issue you need to address is that this function only works with the built-in print() . What if you also want to apply the same treatment to other functions? You don't want to repeat yourself and define similar decorator-like functions for each case.\n\nStep 1 • Change the name of the outer function\n\nThe first step is to change the name of the outer function since you want it to apply to any function, not just print() :\n\nThis doesn't change how the code works, of course. But the new name of the outer function is more generic. Great. Let's move on. The inner function still has print() hardcoded within it. So, this code still only works for the built-in print() .\n\nStep 2 • Add a func parameter to the outer function\n\nInstead of hardcoding print() within the code, you can add a parameter to store_arguments() to represent any function:\n\nThere are three changes in this code compared to the previous version:\n\nThe outer function, store_arguments() , now has a parameter called func . You can call the parameter anything you like, but func is often used to show that you should pass a function to this parameter. The inner() function no longer calls print() . Instead, it now calls func , which is a function—the function you pass when you call store_arguments() . The call to store_arguments() at the end of the code, when you create print_ , now needs the name of a function as an argument. It's up to you to specify which function you want to use in store_arguments() since you can now use it for any function.\n\nIn this case, you pass print to store_arguments() . Therefore, this code performs the same task as the earlier version with print_with_memory() . You can confirm that this is the case:\n\nThe two calls to print_() perform the same task as the standard print() . And the last line allows you to access the list data , which you defined when you created the closure:\n\nI love Python ...and also The Python Coding Stack ['I love Python', '...and also The Python Coding Stack']\n\nA quick note before you move on to Step 3. You can assign the function returned by store_arguments(print) directly to the name print , the one without the trailing underscore. This overwrites the built-in print() since the name print would now refer to the inner() function returned by store_arguments(print) .\n\nYou'll see in Part 3 of this journey through decorators that reusing the original function's name is the most common way of using decorators. However, I'll stick with using different names by adding trailing underscores for now.\n\nStep 3 • Allow any number of arguments to be passed to the inner() function\n\nBut print_() doesn't quite work like the built-in print() . Not yet. Here's an example:\n\nThe first call to print_() works fine, as it did earlier. However, the second and third calls don't work. This code raises an error:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last): File \"...\", line 13, in <module> print_(42, 99, 256) ~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^ TypeError: store_arguments.<locals>.inner() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given\n\nThe second print_() call raises this error, but the third one would also raise a similar error. The error message is also quite informative and helps you understand what's going on. Notice how, even though the error was raised when you call print_() , the error states that store_arguments.<locals>.inner() is the problem. The name print_ refers to this function, which is the function named inner that's a local variable in store_arguments . We'll return to this later in this series.\n\nLet's get back to the failed calls. The built-in print() should work with those arguments. You can try to remove the _ to call the standard print() to confirm that all three calls would work.\n\nThe built-in print() can accept multiple arguments, and it can also accept a keyword argument using the sep keyword. In fact, it can also accept a few more keyword arguments. Here's the signature for print() :\n\nThe inner function must be able to accept these same positional and keyword arguments. You could copy the parameters in the print() signature shown above into inner() . However, you're trying to make store_arguments() work with any function, not just print() . So, you don't want to hardcode these specific parameters.\n\nThat's where *args and **kwargs come in handy:\n\nYou replace the single argument some_obj with *args and **kwargs since these allow you to capture any number of positional and keyword arguments. Therefore, the inner function inner() can be used to replace any function, no matter how many arguments and what type of arguments that function takes.\n\nYou also need to use *args and **kwargs when you call func() within the inner function.\n\nFinally, since the purpose of store_arguments() —we'll call this a decorator soon—is to store the arguments within the list data , you also replace the argument in data.append() . I chose to use a tuple that contains args and kwargs — args is itself a tuple, and kwargs is a dictionary. I'll be publishing a series on functions soon that will discuss *args and **kwargs in more detail.\n\nHere's the output from this code—I reformatted the output of the final list for clarity:\n\nI love Python 42 99 256 10:20:30 [ (('I love Python',), {}), ((42, 99, 256), {}), ((10, 20, 30), {'sep': ':'}), ]\n\nThe new print_() function now works in all situations where the standard print() would work. And the list that stores all the arguments passed to print_() now contains three elements—three tuples:\n\nThe first element in the list is (('I love Python',), {}) . This is a tuple that contains a tuple and a dictionary. The tuple—the first element within the outer tuple—represents args and contains only one element, the string \"I love Python\" . This is the only positional argument you pass to print_() the first time you call this function. The second element in the outer tuple is an empty dictionary since there are no keyword arguments. The second element in the list is ((42, 99, 256), {}) . This tuple contains the tuple (42, 99, 256) . These values are the three positional arguments you pass to print_() the second time you call the function. There are no keyword arguments, therefore the second element in the outer tuple is again an empty dictionary. The third and final element in the list is ((10, 20, 30), {'sep': ':'}) . The positional arguments—the three integers 10 , 20 , and 30 , are included in the args tuple. The kwargs dictionary now shows the key-value pair \"sep\": \":\" . The value associated with the key \"sep\" is the string containing a colon, \":\" .\n\nSo, are you done? Does this finally work? Not quite…\n\nDo you read articles on The Python Coding Stack often? Do you find them useful. I put a lot of time and effort into crafting each article, as you can imagine. If you're in a position to support this publication further, you can either become a paid subscriber or make a one-off contribution.\n\nPaid subscribers also get exclusive access to The Python Coding Place's members' forum. More Python. More discussions. More fun.\n\nAnd I'm planning some other events and activities for paid subscribers. More on this soon…\n\nYour support will help me keep this content coming regularly and, importantly, will help keep it free for everyone.\n\nStep 4 • Add a return statement to the inner function\n\nLet's try using this code with another built-in function, max() :\n\nNote how store_arguments() hasn't changed. That's the point of the changes you made earlier. You can use store_arguments() with any function.\n\nHowever, you now pass max when you call store_arguments() , and you assign the function returned by store_arguments(max) to the name max_ .\n\nNext, you call max_() three times with different arguments. Note that you now need to use print() to show the result. A reminder that this is now the standard built-in print() !\n\nBut here's the output from this code:\n\nNone None None [ ((5, 2, 5, 76, 5, 23), {}), (('Hello', 'Goodbye', 'Au Revoir'), {}), (('Hello', 'Goodbye', 'Au Revoir'), {'key': <function <lambda> at 0x1008e4220>}), ]\n\nThe code doesn't raise any exceptions, and the list that's collecting all the arguments does indeed contain all the arguments.\n\nHowever, the three calls to max_() return None rather than the maximum value from the arguments you pass to max_() . Let's see why this happens.\n\nThe new function max_() replaces the built-in max() . Recall that the function max_() is the inner function inner() returned by store_arguments() .\n\nBut this inner function inner() doesn't have a return statement. And functions that don't have an explicit return statement return None .\n\nThe line func(*args, **kwargs) within inner() is equivalent to max(*args, **kwargs) since func is equal to max . And max() returns a value. However, inner() is discarding the value returned by max() . Let's fix this:\n\nNow, you assign the object returned by func() to value , and then you return value from inner() . You could merge these lines into one if you wish, but I'll keep them separate. You'll see why later in this journey through decorators.\n\nHere's the output from this code:\n\n76 Hello Au Revoir [ ((5, 2, 5, 76, 5, 23), {}), (('Hello', 'Goodbye', 'Au Revoir'), {}), (('Hello', 'Goodbye', 'Au Revoir'), {'key': <function <lambda> at 0x100f8c220>}), ]\n\nAnd since inner() now returns the value returned by the function func —this is max in this case—the new function max_() now also returns the same value as max() .\n\nIt works. The function max_() returns 76 in the first call, since it's the largest number. In the second call, max_() uses lexicographic order, and therefore returns \"Hello\" since uppercase \"H\" comes after both uppercase \"G\" and uppercase \"A\" . In the final call, the keyword argument key=lambda x: len(x) guides max_() to order the arguments using the length of the strings. Therefore, \"Au Revoir\" is the maximum value since it's the longest of the three strings.\n\nCongratulations! You wrote your first decorator. Even if it looks different to what you think a decorator should look like—you usually see them used with the @ notation, which we'll discuss in Part 3— store_arguments() is a decorator. We'll also define what a decorator is later in this decorator journey. But this example is all you need for now.\n\nOne more example\n\nLet's confirm that this decorator, store_arguments() , works with any function:\n\nThe decorator store_arguments() hasn't changed. It accepts any function, and it decorates it by adding some functionality. This decorator stores all the arguments passed to all calls to the decorated function.\n\nIn this example, you decorate a user-defined function, my_special_function() . The decoration happens when you write the following line:\n\nmy_special_function = store_arguments(my_special_function)\n\nYou'll learn about a more common shortcut for this line in Part 3. But it's important to understand this line before introducing the syntactic sugar notation.\n\nOn the right-hand side, you call store_arguments() and pass the name of your function, my_special_function .\n\nThe call to store_arguments() returns another function—the inner function within the store_arguments() function. This inner function performs the same operation as the original function but also performs additional tasks. Therefore, store_arguments() returns a function that's similar to the original function—it returns a decorated version.\n\nFinally, you assign this decorated function to the same name as the original function. I'm no longer using a trailing underscore to distinguish the names. In this version, the name my_special_function no longer refers to the original function. Instead, my_special_function now refers to the decorated function.\n\nHere's the output from this code:\n\nJAMESJAMESJAMES MAIVEMAIVE [(('James', 3), {}), (('Maive', 2), {})]\n\nThe first two lines are the same outputs you would get if you used the original function without decorating it. However, the last line in the output shows you that the arguments you pass to separate calls of the decorated function are stored in a common list.\n\nHere are some final thoughts before we move on:\n\nA decorator is a function that accepts another function as an argument and returns yet another function. The function it returns is a decorated version of the function you pass as an argument. (We'll return to this definition and refine it later in this decorator journey)\n\nThere are three functions involved in this definition, so it can get a bit complex. The decorator, such as store_arguments() , is a function. Its argument and its return value are also functions. These two functions perform similar tasks to each other. However, the function the decorator returns is a decorated version of the function you pass as an argument to the decorator.\n\nStill confused? Don't worry! It will get clearer as you make your way through the rest of this decorator journey.\n\nSupport The Python Coding Stack\n\nTowards Parts 3 to 7\n\nOne of the reasons I think decorators can be hard to understand is because they're often introduced directly using the most common syntax for decorators. You may have seen this in the wild: it uses the @ notation. But I think this hides how decorators work.\n\nIn Parts 1 and 2—that's this article—I chose not to use this notation at all and to build a decorator step-by-step from first principles.\n\nIn the rest of this journey, we'll add more detail and look at more complex decorators. Here's what to expect:\n\nPart 3: Making decorators easier to use with the @ syntax (but only once you understand Parts 1 and 2 well)\n\nPart 4: We'll bring everything together into a new example to consolidate everything we know so far.\n\nPart 5: Extending decorators to include parameters, so that you can pass arguments directly to 'decorators'.\n\nPart 6: Using classes as decorators instead of functions\n\nPart 7: Decorating classes instead of functions (no, this is not the same as Part 6!)\n\nYou can find Parts 3 - 7 a separate article.\n\nAnything not clear? Just ask in the comments or on The Python Coding Place forum.\n\nImage by Erelsa from Pixabay\n\nCode in this article uses Python 3.13\n\nThe code images used in this article are created using Snappify.

While for some types of media that vision is further out, for written content this proclamation has already come to pass. We’re in an age of just in time content.\n\nTraditionally if you wanted to produce a piece of written content on a topic you’d have two choices. Do the research yourself, write a draft, edit, refine, and finally publish. Or you could get someone else to do that process for you either by hiring them directly or indirectly by getting content they wrote for a publisher.\n\nToday written content is generated in real-time for anyone on anything. That’s a pretty broad statement to make so let me make it more concrete. I’ve written 3 books, thousands of articles, and given hundreds of talks on digital product design. The generative AI feature on my Website, Ask LukeW, searches all this content, finds, ranks, and re-ranks it in order to answer people’s questions on the topics I’ve written about.\n\nBecause all my content has been broken down into almost atomic units, there’s an endless number of recombinations possible. Way more than I could have possibly ever written myself. For instance, if someone asks:\n\nEach corresponding answer is a unique composition of content that did not exist before. Every response is created for a specific person with a specific need at a specific time. After that, it’s no longer relevant. That may sound extreme but I’ve long contended that as soon as something is published, especially news and non-fiction, it’s out of date. That’s why project sites within companies are never up to date and why news articles just keep coming.\n\nBut if you keep adding bits of additional content to an overall corpus for generative AI to draw from, the responses can remain timely and relevant. That’s what I’ve been doing with the content corpus Ask LukeW draws from. While I’ve written 89 publicly visible blog posts over the past two years, I added over 500 bits of content behind the scenes that the Ask LukeW feature can draw from. Most of it driven by questions people asked that Ask LukeW wasn’t able to answer well but should have given the information I have in my head.\n\nFor me this feels like the new way of publishing. I'm building a corpus with infinite malleability instead of a more limited number of discrete artifacts.\n\nTwo years ago, I had to build a system to power the content corpus indexing, retrieval, and ranking that makes Ask LukeW work. Today people can do this on the fly. For instance in this video example using Bench, I make use of a PDF of my book and Web search results to expand on a topic in my tone and voice with citations across both sources. The end result is written content assembled from multiple corpuses: my book and the Web.\n\nIt’s not just PDFs and Web pages though, nearly anything can serve as a content corpus for generative publishing. In this example from Bench, I use a massive JSON file to create a comprehensive write-up about the water levels in Lake Almanor, CA. The end result combines data from the file with AI model weights to produce a complete analysis of the lake’s changing water levels over the years alongside charts and insights about changing patterns.\n\nAs these examples illustrate, publishing has changed. Content is now generated just in time for anyone on anything. And as the capabilities of AI models and tools keep advancing, we’re going to see publishing change even more."}

I thought it might be a good idea to list all the most important Clojure power tools in one blog post so that I don’t forget them in the future. I add to this list also Clojure libraries that I use in my Clojure/script fullstack applications.\n\nI use this Clojure fullstack application to introduce those power tools: replicant-webstore.\n\nVSCode, Calva and REPL Editor Integration\n\nYour editor is of course one of your most important tools what ever programming language you use. My current choice is Visual Studio Code. It is rather light but also provides a rich set of extensions for various programming purposes. Nowadays, it also provides a good generative AI integration to help you with your programming tasks, I have written a couple of blog posts about Using Copilot in Programming about and my Copilot Keybindings.\n\nIf you are programming Clojure with VSCode editor, I defnitely recommend the excellent Calva extension. It provides a great Clojure REPL integration to VSCode, paredit structural editing, and much more. If you are interested trying Calva, I recommend reading the excellent Calva documentation and start using it. I have also written three blog posts regarding my Calva configurations:\n\nAn important part of using Clojure is the keybindings (e.g. for evaluating forms, giving paredit commands, etc.). I have written a couple of blog posts regarding my keybindings:\n\nAnd one hint. Keep your VSCode configurations (at least keybindings.json and settings.json ) in version control (Git).\n\nBabashka\n\nBabashka is a marvelous tool for writing scripts and automating tasks. I have written a couple of blog posts regarding Babashka:\n\nI learned from one Metosin example project how to use Babashka as a task runner for my projects. See my latest Clojure fullstack exercise in which I used Babashka as a task runner, expecially file bb.edn and bb-scripts directory for how to start the backend and frontend REPLs.\n\nFullstack Libraries\n\nMetosin Libraries: Reitit, Malli and Jsonista\n\nThese are my favourite Metosin Libraries I always include to my Clojure fullstack projects. You can use these libraries both in the backend and the frontend.\n\nReitit provides excellent routing functionalities. See in that clojure fullstack application I mentioned previously:\n\nroutes.clj: Backend API routing.\n\nroutes.cljs: Frontend web app routing.\n\nMalli provides excellent schema that you can use as a Clojure common ( cljc ) file that you can comprise both to your backend API and your frontend to validate that the backend returned data that conforms to the schema. See example in that Clojure fullstack application: schema.cljc.\n\nJsonista is a Clojure library for JSON encoding and decoding. Using Muuntaja you can easily do edn/json encoding in your API.\n\nAero and Integrant\n\nAero is an excellent configuration library. See example in config.edn regarding the demonstration application configuration and how to read it in main.clj.\n\nIntegrant provides a nice way to define your application from components, define the relationships between the components in your configuration (see the config.edn file above), and reset/reload the state of your application using those components. See also db.clj in which the defmethod ig/init-key :db/tsv function reads the tab separated file and initializes our little “demonstration database.”\n\nReplicant and Hiccup\n\nIn the frontend, I used for years Reagent which is a React wrapper for Clojurescript. There are some technical challenges for Reagent to use the latest React versions, and I was therefore looking for some new UI Clojurescript technology. I first considered using UIx which is also a React wrapper for Clojurescript. But then I discovered Replicant which with Hiccup is a very lightweight and Clojurish way of doing frontend. I have covered Replicant in a couple of my blog posts:\n\nREPL\n\nIf you are learning Clojure, Programming at the REPL is something you definitely have to learn. You should check what kind of REPL support there is with the editor you are using, and start learning to use it. If you are using VSCode, you find more information above in chapter VSCode, Calva and REPL Editor Integration.\n\nI have three monitors at my desk. The main monitor is where I keep my VSCode editor. In the side monitor I keep the REPL window. This way I can maximize the main monitor for the editing, but also see in my side the REPL output. If you are using VSCode, this is easy. You first start the REPL with Calva. If you have done the same kind of Calva configuration that I have explained in my previous blog posts, you should have your Calva Output in VSCode editor area in a tab. Give VSCode command View: Move Editor into New Window , this will move the active editor tab into a new VSCode Window. Now you can move the REPL output window into your second monitor.\n\nI have a couple similar commands to evaluate Clojure forms in Calva. Alt-L evaluates the form and outputs the result in the editor as an ephemeral output which you can reset with Esc key. With Alt+Shift+L Calva writes the evaluation result below the evaluated form like this:\n\n( keys ( deref ( :db/tsv ( user/env )))) ;;=> (:books :movies)\n\nREPL is your power tool with Clojure and you should learn to use it efficiently.\n\nPersonal Profile Deps\n\nThis is my current ~/.clojure/deps.edn file:\n\n{ :aliases { :kari { :extra-paths [ \"scratch\" ] :extra-deps { ; NOTE: hashp 0.2.1 sci print bug. hashp/hashp { :mvn/version \"0.2.2\" } org.clojars.abhinav/snitch { :mvn/version \"0.1.16\" } com.gfredericks/debug-repl { :mvn/version \"0.0.12\" } djblue/portal { :mvn/version \"0.58.5\" }}} :reveal { :extra-deps { vlaaad/reveal { :mvn/version \"1.3.284\" }} :ns-default vlaaad.reveal :exec-fn repl } :outdated { ;; Note that it is `:deps`, not `:extra-deps` :deps { com.github.liquidz/antq { :mvn/version \"2.11.1269\" }} :main-opts [ \"-m\" \"antq.core\" ]}}}\n\nI use these tools quite often and therefore keep them in my personal profile kari.\n\nI then add my kari profile to scripts I use to start REPL in development, like this:\n\n:backend-repl-command [ \"clojure -M:dev:backend:frontend:shadow-cljs:calva-external-repl:test:kari -i bb-scripts/backendinit.clj -m nrepl.cmdline --middleware \\\"[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware,shadow.cljs.devtools.server.nrepl/middleware]\\\"\" ]\n\nInline Defs\n\nInline defs is an old Clojure trick to debug Clojure code. Let’s explain it with a small example:\n\n( defmethod ig/init-key :db/tsv [ _ { :keys [ path data ] :as db-opts }] ( log/infof \"Reading tsv data, config is %s\" ( pr-str db-opts )) ( let [ books ( read-datafile ( str path \"/\" ( :books data )) book-line book-str ) _ ( def mybooks books ) ;; THIS IS THE INLINE DEF movies ( read-datafile ( str path \"/\" ( :movies data )) movie-line movie-str )] ( atom { :books books :movies movies }))) ( comment ;; AND HERE WE EXAMINE WHAT HAPPENED. ( count mybooks ) ;;=> 35 ( first mybooks ) ;;=> {:id 2001, ;; :product-group 1, ;; :title \"Kalevala\", ;; :price 3.95, ;; :author \"Elias Lönnrot\", ;; :year 1835, ;; :country \"Finland\", ;; :language \"Finnish\"}\n\nI hardly ever use the Calva debugger, since Clojure provides much better tools to examine your live program state. Nowadays instead of inline defs, I use Snitch.\n\nHashp\n\nI used to use Hashp quite often in my debugging sessions, but nowadays more Snitch. But instead of adding a prn line in some let and see the REPL output, hashp is a good alternative.\n\nPortal\n\nYou can use portal in development to tap to various data. I have added a couple of examples how to tap to the data in files.\n\nIn the Clojure side, in routes.clj:\n\n;; Example how to tap to the data using djblue Portal: ( require ' [ clj-http.client :as client ]) ( require ' [ jsonista.core :as json ]) ( defn json-to-edn [ json-str ] ( json/read-value json-str ( json/object-mapper { :decode-key-fn keyword }))) ( json-to-edn \"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Book\\\", \\\"price\\\": 29.99}\" ) ( :body ( client/get \"http://localhost:8331/api/products/books\" )) ;; Tap to the data: ; https://github.com/djblue/portal ( require ' [ portal.api :as p ]) ; This should open the Portal window. ( def p ( p/open )) ( add-tap # 'p/submit ) ( tap> :hello ) ( tap> ( json-to-edn ( :body ( client/get \"http://localhost:8331/api/products/books\" )))) ;; You should now see a vector of book maps in the portal window.\n\nIn the Clojurescript side, in app.cljs:\n\n;; Example how to tap to the data using djblue Portal: ( require ' [ portal.web :as p ]) ; NOTE: This asks a popup window, you have to accept it in the browser!!! ( def p ( p/open )) ; Now you should have a new pop-up browser window... ( add-tap # 'p/submit ) ( tap> :hello ) ( tap> ( get-in @ !state [ :db/data :books ])) ;; You should now see a vector of book maps in the portal window.\n\nGadget\n\nGadget is nowadays my main debugging tool with Replicant. Gadget provides a very good view to your frontend state while developing the frontend.\n\nGadget.\n\nCalva Debugger\n\nCalva provides a nice debugger. As I already explained before, I very seldom use it. But now, I just used it to provide the example below, and I realized that it is actually quite a nice tool, and I should use it more in the future.\n\nCalva debugger.\n\nSo, you just add the #dbg reader tag to your code and once your code execution goes to that point the debugger triggers.\n\nSnitch\n\nPeter Strömberg, the creator of Calva, once again introduced an excellent new tool to me: Snitch. I watched Peter’s excellent demo how he uses Snitch, and I immediately realized that I switch ad hoc inline defs to Snitch. I recommend watching Peter’s video on how to use Snitch.\n\nSnitch is a tool that adds inline Defs to your function.\n\nI mostly use defn* which injects inline defs for all the bindings in the function: parameters and let bindings. If I want to examine what happens in the function, my workflow is like this: 1. Change: def => def*. 2. Integrant reset. 3. Call the API (or what ever, which finally calls the function). 4. Examine bindings in the function by evaluating them in the function context.\n\nAdd this to user.clj\n\n;; https://github.com/AbhinavOmprakash/snitch ( require ' [ snitch.core :refer [ defn* defmethod* *fn *let ]])\n\nBonus Tool: Copilot\n\nMy corporation provides GitHub Copilot Enterprise License. Copilot is a great tool to assist you in programming. I am still a bit of old school programmer in that sense that I hardly ever let Copilot to do editing in the actual text files, but I mostly have a conversation with Copilot in the VSCode integrated Copilot Chat view.\n\nI have explained my Copilot use in this blog post: Copilot Keybindings.\n\nConclusions\n\nClojure is an excellent programming language. It has a rich ecosystem and tools that you just don’t have in other programming languages, due to the fact that other programming languages not being homoiconic languages just can’t have e.g. a real REPL.\n\nThe writer is working at a major international IT corporation building cloud infrastructures and implementing applications on top of those infrastructures.\n\nKari Marttila"}

The New York Times, for example, is laden with pieces about how we’re afflicted with a God-shaped hole in our souls that must be filled by religion. They have, in fact, published several excepts (which I’ve criticized) of Ross Douthat’s new book Believe: Why Everyone Should Believe in God, and now you can find his goddy lucubrations at The Free Press as well. The New Yorker also gave his views a lot of space, views that I summarized and criticized here. An excerpt from that post:\n\nI swear, NYT columnist Ross Douthat must have a huge publicity machine, because his latest book, Believe: Why Everyone Should Be Religious, is appearing everywhere, usually as excerpts. The point of the book is to assert that religion’s decline in America is slowing, and that readers having a “God-shaped hole,” denoting a lack of religious meaning in their lives, should not just become religious, but become Christian. (Douthat thinks that Catholicism is the “right” religion, and of course he happens to be Catholic). And by “believe,” Douthat doesn’t just mean adhering to a watered-down form of Christianity that sees the New Testament as a series of metaphors. No, he really believes the tenets of his faith, including the miracles of Jesus, the Crucifixion and Resurrection, and the existence of Satan and the afterlife. (See my posts on this delusional book here.) It is a sign of the times that this book, which calls for people to embrace claims that are palpably ridiculous and totally unevidenced—unless you take the New Testament literally, which you can’t because it’s wrong and self-contradictory—is getting not only wide press, but approbation. Even the New Yorker summary and review of the book, which you can read by clicking below (the screenshot links to the archived version here) is pretty mild in its criticism. Author Rothman is a nonbeliever, and gives good responses to Douthat’s “evidence” for God, but at the end says the he “respects [Douthat’s effort to persuade.” What does that mean? He respects Douthat’s efforts to proselytize people with a divisive and harmful faith, and to believe stuff without evidence? Well, the New Yorker has always been a bit soft on faith (despite the fact that most of its writers are atheists), because some of their rich and educated readers have “belief in belief”.\n\nAll the attention devoted to the “resurgence” of religion in American seems to come from a 2024 Pew survey of “nones” (people who aren’t affiliated with a conventional church), a group that’s been increasing for a long time, Nones include atheists, agnostics, people who consider themselves spiritual, pantheists, and God-believers who don’t fit in anywhere.\n\nLook! A drop in one year!\n\nAs you see, the rise in “nones” has been pretty steady since 2007, nearly doubling in percentage by 2022. But from 2022 to 2023, the number of nones fell by 3%. That fall is what seems to have excited lots of believers (or “believers in belief”), who are pumping out articles on the resurgence of religion in America and excitedly writing books and articles dissecting why God is back.\n\nNow this fall may be real, but I doubt it will continue, if for no other reason than, as Steve Pinker has pointed out, science and rationality continue to take up the space that used to be God’s purview, at least in the West. My own prediction is that, given a few centuries, America will be about as atheistic as Scandinavia, with “religious” observances confined to weddings, holidays, and the like.\n\nWhat does the fall mean? Well, it could reflect a rise in wokeness, an ideology that nicely accommodates religious belief. It could reflect the fact that we had a pandemic, or that American economic and social well being fell during this period. It’s well known that when well-being falls, religiosity rises and “none-ness” is likely to fall. (Marx was perhaps the first to realize this but it’s been modernized and verified by the work of Norris and Inglehart, whose thesis is summarized in this book, summarized thusly:\n\nThis book develops a theory of existential security. It demonstrates that the publics of virtually all advanced industrial societies have been moving toward more secular orientations during the past half century, but also that the world as a whole now has more people with traditional religious views than ever before. This second edition expands the theory and provides new and updated evidence from a broad perspective and in a wide range of countries. This confirms that religiosity persists most strongly among vulnerable populations, especially in poorer nations and in failed states. Conversely, a systematic erosion of religious practices, values, and beliefs has occurred among the more prosperous strata in rich nations.\n\nThe U.S., by the way, doesn’t rank very highly in either happiness or well-being (including income inequality), possibly explaining why, though we have a substantial amount of secularity, it’s much lower than in countries like Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland, which are also less religious.\n\nAt any rate, the slight fall in the graph above has given rise to a huge amount of press explaining and extolling America’s return to God. We are told, for example, that we harbor a “God-shaped hole”: a longing to find meaning in life that can be fulfilled only by accepting a divine being. (Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a prominent exponent of this view,and it may have worked for her.)\n\nAll I’m saying is that I predict a spate of articles in the press touting America’s return to God and explaining our “God-shaped hole.” And, as far as I can see, it all comes down to that 3% drop in “nones” over one year. There may be more to these claims that I don’t know, but I don’t think America is reverting to conventional religious belief."}

The combination of COVID-19 seasons, prospects in their mid-20s, transfers and NIL have created several obstacles for scouts to sift through.\n\n\"Maybe this is how it's going to look [from now on], but this year feels different,\" a longtime AFC scout said. \"[It's] pretty thin on top [of the board], thick in the middle, and NIL probably carved out the back end [of Day 3].\"\n\nThat leaves a class with fewer players with first-round grades than usual. But it does have one of the most unique prospects of the modern era, as Colorado wide receiver/cornerback Travis Hunter is ranked as the No. 1 player at two different positions by much of the league. It also has a polarizing group of quarterbacks. While Cam Ward (Miami) seems destined to be the first overall pick, the rest of the crop -- led by Shedeur Sanders (Colorado) and Jaxson Dart (Ole Miss) -- has drawn a variety of reactions from decision-makers.\n\nWith those factors in mind, here is my annual top-100 list heading into the draft, which starts Thursday at 8 p.m. ET in Green Bay, Wisconsin (ESPN, ABC and the ESPN App). This list is based on grades, not position value. This isn't meant to be a mock draft, just a pure ranking of the top prospects. Thanks to all those around the league who took the time to chat and answer piles of questions around this annual project.\n\nNote: Listed 40 times are best verified or electronically timed.\n\n1. Travis Hunter, CB/WR, Colorado\n\nHeight: 6-foot-1 | Weight: 188 pounds | 40 time: Did not run (DNR)\n\nThere are minor concerns that Hunter's frame won't hold up in the NFL, especially if he plays offense and defense. But let's face it: The 2024 Heisman winner is the No. 1 player at wide receiver and cornerback, so that makes him my No. 1 player. The 96 receptions for 1,258 yards and 15 touchdowns along with four interceptions don't hurt, either. The challenge for whoever drafts him is finding the ideal play distribution between corner and receiver that maximizes his development and impact.\n\n2. Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn State\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 250 | 40 time: DNR\n\nThere are some injury concerns with Carter. He didn't work out at the combine due to a shoulder injury and had a stress fracture discovered in his right foot during the medical exam. But Carter is a relentless, explosive pass rusher, with 12 sacks and 23.5 tackles for loss last season. He should make an immediate NFL impact.\n\n3. Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State\n\nHeight: 5-9 | Weight: 211 | 40 time: DNR\n\nThere might be a slight pause about Jeanty's workload -- he averaged 31 carries per game last season -- and fumbles (nine in the past two seasons). But some believe he's the best player in this class. He rushed for 2,601 yards in 2024 and combines strength, balance and vision with big-play ability (12 runs of 50-plus yards last season).\n\n4. Tyler Warren, TE, Penn State\n\nHeight: 6-6 | Weight: 256 | 40 time: DNR\n\nWarren exploded as a senior, with 104 receptions for 1,233 yards and eight touchdowns in 2024 after compiling 49 catches the previous three seasons. He can line up in-line, in the slot or out wide and has room for further growth. His ability to run with power and drive makes him a Wildcat quarterback option, too.\n\nplay 1:41 See why NFL scouts call Penn State's Tyler Warren a 'Swiss Army Knife' Check out highlights from Penn State TE Tyler Warren ahead of the 2025 NFL draft.\n\n5. Walter Nolen, DT, Ole Miss\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 296 | 40 time: DNR\n\nA former No. 1 overall recruit, Nolen broke out with 6.5 sacks and 14 tackles in 2024 to earn All-America honors. He was aided by Ole Miss' defensive tackle-friendly scheme, but Nolen plays with urgency and top-shelf strength. His best football is in front of him.\n\n6. Will Campbell, OT, LSU\n\nHeight: 6-6 | Weight: 319 | 40 time: 4.98 seconds\n\nThere's been a lot of talk about Campbell's 32⅝-inch arm length measurement at the combine -- below the league's threshold for tackles. But Campbell has high-level movement skills and has passed every test against many of the nation's best pass rushers over the past three seasons. He's also a pounder in the run game.\n\n7. Mason Graham, DT, Michigan\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 296 | 40 time: DNR\n\nA good rule when evaluating prospects in the trenches is to defer to those with an accomplished wrestling background. Graham has that, and if there were a \"tossed defender aside\" metric, he would likely lead the nation. He's a high-effort player with 14.5 tackles for loss over the past two seasons.\n\n8. Jahdae Barron, CB, Texas\n\nHeight: 5-11 | Weight: 194 | 40 time: 4.39\n\nSome people might scoff at Barron being this high, but he's a resourceful player with the versatility to play outside, in the slot or as a dime linebacker. He has elite speed and doesn't waste steps or miss tackles. He won the Jim Thorpe Award in 2024 after recording five interceptions and 11 passes defensed.\n\n9. Colston Loveland, TE, Michigan\n\nHeight: 6-6 | Weight 248 | 40 time: DNR\n\nLoveland sat out the combine because of right shoulder surgery but said that he would be full-go for training camp. His ability to stress the seams of the defense with his speed and movement ability are highly coveted. Loveland set the Michigan school record for tight ends with 56 receptions in 2024.\n\n10. Armand Membou, OT, Missouri\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 332 | 40 time: 4.91\n\nMembou has been arguably the biggest riser in this class and projects best as a right tackle. He's smooth in pass protection and mirrored some of the nation's best edge players this past season. Membou also has the power to clear defenders in the run game.\n\n11. Jihaad Campbell, LB, Alabama\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 235 | 40 time: 4.52\n\nIs Campbell an off-ball linebacker or an edge rusher? He started as an edge as a freshman, moved to linebacker as a sophomore, then played both in 2024. Campbell led the Crimson Tide in tackles (112), tackles for loss (11.5), sacks (5) and forced fumbles (2) last season.\n\n12. Jalon Walker, Edge, Georgia\n\nHeight: 6-1 | Weight: 243 | 40 time: DNR\n\nThe Bulldogs moved Walker all over their defense, but he projects best as an edge rusher in the NFL thanks to his explosiveness and closing ability as a pass rusher. Walker has led Georgia in sacks the past two seasons but also plays with decisiveness and physicality against the run.\n\n13. Will Johnson, CB, Michigan\n\nHeight: 6-2 | Weight: 194 | 40 time: DNR\n\nJohnson has been great when he has played -- he had nine interceptions and three pick-sixes in his college career, including two in 2024. But a turf-toe injury limited him to six games last season. He's fluid in coverage and has quick recognition with ideal size, but he will need to improve his tackling.\n\n14. Mykel Williams, Edge, Georgia\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 260 | 40 time: DNR\n\nWilliams suffered an ankle injury in Georgia's season opener that held him back in 2024, so he didn't have the breakout season many expected. He ended up with five sacks and 8.5 tackles for loss, but he can make an immediate NFL impact as a pass rusher.\n\n15. Nick Emmanwori, S, South Carolina\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 220 | 40 time: 4.38\n\nEmmanwori put on a show at the combine, but he is more than a workout warrior. He had 88 tackles and four interceptions this past season, two of which he returned for touchdowns. His size and traits allow him to move around and play as a safety, dime linebacker or big nickel corner.\n\n16. Derrick Harmon, DT, Oregon\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 313 | 40 time: 4.95\n\nHarmon flourished after transferring from Michigan State, with 10.5 tackles for loss, 5 sacks and 2 forced fumbles in his only season at Oregon. His strong hands, big reach and explosiveness in shedding blockers make him a consistent interior disruptor.\n\n17. Matthew Golden, WR, Texas\n\nHeight: 5-11 | Weight: 191 | 40 time: 4.29\n\nGolden averaged 17.0 yards per catch in his only season with the Longhorns, with 58 receptions for 987 yards and nine touchdowns. The Houston transfer had the second-fastest 40 at the combine. When he's dialed in, he can separate from even the best corners and is dependable no matter where he lines up.\n\n18. Cam Ward, QB, Miami\n\nHeight: 6-2 | Weight: 219 | 40 time: DNR\n\nWard will be selected long before this -- probably before anyone else -- because of his pocket awareness and smooth short-area movements. Add in a quick release and his mental toughness with the willingness to be the \"it'' guy, and you have an immediate starter. He must clean up accuracy issues and his footwork when he's in sling-it mode.\n\nplay 1:42 Kevin Clark: Cam Ward is closest prospect to Patrick Mahomes Domonique Foxworth disagrees with Kevin Clark's comparison of Cam Ward to Patrick Mahomes.\n\n19. Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 219 | 40 time: 4.53\n\nHe is the production king of the receiver class, with back-to-back seasons of at least 84 receptions, 1,300 yards and more than 15 yards per reception. McMillan also had a 304-yard game in 2024. The former volleyball player consistently wins contested catches.\n\n20. Kelvin Banks Jr., OT, Texas\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 315 | 40 time: 5.16\n\nBanks won the Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award last season. Some in the league believe he might be a guard because he is more refined as a punishing, smooth mover in the run game than a pass protector. Banks needs a little more strength to deal with the league's speed-to-power rushers and cleaner work with his hands.\n\n21. Emeka Egbuka, WR, Ohio State\n\nHeight: 6-1 | Weight: 202 | 40 time: 4.48\n\nThis wide receiver class isn't as strong as some in previous years, but Egbuka is a safe, top-tier performer who is NFL-ready. He finished as Ohio State's all-time leader in receptions (205). Egbuka runs routes with precision and tempo and consistently creates separation.\n\n22. Tyler Booker, G, Alabama\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 321 | 40 time: 5.38\n\nBooker is a powerful interior presence who plays with quality awareness in pass protection and the strength to wall off rushers. He also finishes with purpose in the run game. He was a team captain as a junior and should start right away in the NFL.\n\n23. Luther Burden III, WR, Missouri\n\nHeight: 6-0 | Weight: 206 | 40 time: 4.41\n\nHis route portfolio will be far larger in the NFL, as the vast majority of Burden's collegiate targets came within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage. He had only one 100-yard game in 2024, though he flourished in 2023 (86 receptions for 1,212 yards and nine touchdowns). Burden has powerful hands, plays with toughness and is dynamic after the catch.\n\n24. Shemar Stewart, Edge/DT, Texas A&M\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 267 | 40 time: 4.59\n\nStewart is one of the toughest evaluations on the board. He has coveted physical abilities and had a ridiculous combine workout that featured a 40 time better than some receivers. His 4.5 combined sacks in three seasons are the biggest red flag, as well as his inconsistent pressure rate.\n\n25. TreVeyon Henderson, RB, Ohio State\n\nHeight: 5-10 | Weight: 202 | 40 time: 4.43\n\nWhat more do you want? Henderson had two 1,000-yard seasons and another 900-yard season, and did not fumble in his past three seasons. He is the best pass protector in this running back class and a quality receiver who runs with acceleration and tempo. It would be inaccurate to pigeonhole him as a third-down back.\n\n26. James Pearce Jr., Edge, Tennessee\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 245 | 40 time: 4.47\n\nPearce's speed, explosiveness off the ball and consistent high-pressure rate (19.0% in 2024, second in FBS) are tantalizing. He doesn't have the elite flexibility of some of the best edge prospects, which could slow his development if he can't consistently disengage from blockers.\n\n27. Mike Green, Edge, Marshall\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 251 | 40 time: DNR\n\nGreen broke through in 2024, leading the FBS with 17 sacks, a big step up from the 4.5 he had in 2023. He is a high-effort player with flexibility and an array of counters to get to the quarterback.\n\n28. Donovan Ezeiruaku, Edge, Boston College\n\nHeight: 6-2 | Weight: 248 | 40 time: DNR\n\nEzeiruaku is arguably the most productive player in a deep edge class, compiling 80 tackles, 16.5 sacks, 20.5 tackles for loss and 3 forced fumbles in 12 games. He moves from speed to power effectively and has the flexibility to get to the corner. He has inside counters and plays with an edge.\n\n29. Nic Scourton, Edge, Texas A&M\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 257 | 40 time: DNR\n\nFew players show as much diversity in the pass rush as Scourton, and he faced more double-teams and chips than his Aggies teammates. He also plays with consistent intensity -- a third of his tackles in 2024 were for a loss, and he had 10 sacks for Purdue in 2023 before transferring.\n\n30. Malaki Starks, S, Georgia\n\nHeight: 6-1 | Weight: 197 | 40 time: 4.50\n\nStarks has put plenty on tape during his 42 starts in three seasons. He played both safety and nickel corner, with six interceptions in his college career. Starks ran well at the combine, and teams have been impressed with his interviews.\n\n31. Kenneth Grant, DT, Michigan\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 331 | 40 time: 5.07\n\nMost evaluators want to see more consistent production, but Grant's power, agility and size make him a unique player. When he's at his best, he's the kind of interior disruptor NFL teams want. He had 6.5 sacks and knocked down 11 passes over the past two seasons.\n\n32. Shedeur Sanders, QB, Colorado\n\nHeight: 6-1 | Weight: 212 | 40 time: DNR\n\nWhen he sets his feet in a clean pocket, Sanders shows the best mechanics and accuracy of any quarterback in this draft. His 71.8% completion rate in two seasons at Colorado is an FBS career record. But he is undersized and doesn't throw the ball quickly, which partially explains why he took an FBS-leading 94 sacks the past two seasons.\n\nplay 1:42 Shedeur Sanders' college mixtape shows his NFL potential Check out highlights from Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders ahead of the 2025 NFL draft.\n\n33. Grey Zabel, OL, North Dakota State\n\nHeight: 6-6 | Weight: 312 | 40 time: DNR\n\nZabel has the potential to play every offensive line position. He started games at left guard, left tackle and right tackle at North Dakota State, then dominated at center during Senior Bowl practices. Zabel plays with maximum toughness and awareness.\n\n34. Mason Taylor, TE, LSU\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 251 | 40 time: 4.68\n\nTaylor was primarily used as an in-line player in LSU's offense, though he has some experience in the slot. He doesn't have the same timed speed as some of the other top tight ends, but his routes are clean and he knows how to put defenders in a bad spot. He's the only TE in LSU history to exceed 100 career receptions.\n\n35. Xavier Watts, S, Notre Dame\n\nHeight: 6-0 | Weight: 204 | 40 time: 4.59\n\nWatts and Travis Hunter were the only players to be consensus All-Americans in 2023 and 2024. Watts had 14 pass breakups and two forced fumbles the past two seasons combined, and his six interceptions led FBS in 2024. He has elite awareness, ball skills and is rarely flagged. He will flourish in a zone-heavy scheme.\n\n36. Dylan Sampson, RB, Tennessee\n\nHeight: 5-8 | Weight: 200 | 40 time: DNR\n\nSampson scored 22 rushing touchdowns last season to break a school record that stood for 95 years. While some might think he is undersized, he knows how to work the crowded areas of the field. Half of his touchdown runs last season were of 5 yards or fewer, and he has a top-shelf jump cut.\n\n37. Omarion Hampton, RB, North Carolina\n\nHeight: 6-0 | Weight: 221 | 40 time: 4.46\n\nHampton was highly productive the past two seasons, rushing for 1,660 yards in 2024 and 1,504 in 2023. He's not a quick cutter, but he is decisive to the point of attack and is a high-contact runner who smashes through defenders. While that might not be sustainable, he did average 3.7 yards after contact last season.\n\n38. Josh Simmons, OT, Ohio State\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 317 | 40 time: DNR\n\nSimmons' predraft assessments centered mostly around his recovery from what he said was a torn patellar tendon in his left knee that he suffered in October. Simmons has experience at both tackle spots and showed the movement ability teams want in pass protection.\n\n2025 NFL Draft Day Predictor simulator Our mock draft simulator allows users to act as the general manager of their favorite team, giving them the opportunity to make picks in all seven rounds and conduct trades throughout the draft.\n\nDraft Day Predictor » | Simulator »\n\n39. Trey Amos, CB, Ole Miss\n\nHeight: 6-1 | Weight: 195 | 40 time: 4.43\n\nAmos has the length and willingness to be physical with receivers that translates well to the NFL. He was more consistent in zone in 2024 and can disrupt receivers in press man coverage. He also finds the ball, having knocked down 26 passes over the past three seasons.\n\n40. Josh Conerly Jr., OT, Oregon\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 311 | 40 time: 5.05\n\nHe had 28 consecutive starts at left tackle for the Ducks over the past two seasons and has excelled in pass protection. Conerly is an ascending player who has made significant jumps over the past two years. His performance in the Big Ten championship game, when he held Abdul Carter without a sack, turned heads.\n\n41. Donovan Jackson, G, Ohio State\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 315 | 40 time: DNR\n\nJackson moved from left guard to left tackle after Josh Simmons' injury and impressed in that role. Despite some bobbles, he showed more positional flexibility than anticipated. The three-year starter has the power and movement skills to plug and play at guard.\n\n42. Shavon Revel Jr., CB, East Carolina\n\nHeight: 6-2 | Weight: 194 | 40 time: DNR\n\nRevel tore his left ACL during a mid-September practice, but his doctor has informed teams he is expected to be ready for training camp. He's long and has shown top-level play speed along with an understanding of route concepts.\n\n43. Quinshon Judkins, RB, Ohio State\n\nHeight: 6-0 | Weight: 221 | 40 time: 4.48\n\nJudkins had three consecutive 1,000-yard rushing seasons -- two at Ole Miss and 1,060 yards this past season for Ohio State. He scored a touchdown every 16.4 carries in his college career and runs with physicality and decisiveness.\n\n44. Maxwell Hairston, CB, Kentucky\n\nHeight: 5-11 | Weight: 183 | 40 time: 4.28\n\nHairston was the fastest player who ran at the combine and routinely closes throwing windows with his speed. He has shown comfort in man or zone, but his concentration wavers at times. He'll need to be a much better tackler as a pro to reach his potential, though his struggles there in 2024 could be attributed to a shoulder injury.\n\n45. Carson Schwesinger, LB, UCLA\n\nHeight: 6-2 | Weight: 242 | 40 time: DNR\n\nSchwesinger's film will have to speak loudly, as a hamstring injury kept him out of most combine drills and UCLA's pro day. The former walk-on was a finalist for the Butkus Award in 2024 in his only season as a starter, compiling 136 tackles (90 solo). He's an effective blitzer who rarely misses tackles.\n\n46. Tyleik Williams, DT, Ohio State\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 334 | 40 time: DNR\n\nWilliams pulled a hamstring on his first 40-yard dash attempt at his pro day, which could carry over postdraft. When healthy, he is an interior power player who gets involved. He had 54 tackles in 2023 and added 46 in 2024 despite missing three games. He plays a little upright, so taller NFL guards could give him some difficulty.\n\nplay 0:41 Tyleik Williams' NFL draft profile Check out some of the top highlights from Ohio State's Tyleik Williams.\n\n47. Demetrius Knight Jr., LB, South Carolina\n\nHeight: 6-2 | Weight: 235 | 40 time: 4.58\n\nKnight is one of the oldest prospects on the board -- he turned 25 in January and played six college seasons -- which might negatively impact his stock. But he gets off blocks, makes play after play and has shown maturity and work ethic in his interviews with teams.\n\n48. Landon Jackson, Edge, Arkansas\n\nHeight: 6-6 | Weight: 264 | 40 time: 4.68\n\nEvaluators saw his explosiveness during the season, but his combine workout had many scouts reassessing his tape. He doesn't look smooth when he plays and will need to improve his lower-body flexibility as a pro. But he produces, with 13 sacks over the past two seasons.\n\n49. JT Tuimoloau, Edge, Ohio State\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 265 | 40 time: DNR\n\nTuimoloau had a huge 2024 season, with 21.5 tackles for loss (third in FBS) and 12.5 sacks. Some defensive line coaches see him as a high-effort player who can improve his pass-rush techniques to have more success when he doesn't win with power after the snap.\n\n50. Jack Sawyer, Edge, Ohio State\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 260 | 40 time: DNR\n\nSawyer closed his 2024 season on a positive note, with 4.5 sacks and six knockdowns in the Buckeyes' four playoff games. He capped it off with a strip-sack, 83-yard scoop-and-score in Ohio State's CFP semifinal victory over Texas in the Cotton Bowl. He is a power-first player who might not fit everybody's scheme but plays with intensity.\n\n51. Shemar Turner, DT, Texas A&M\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 290 | 40 time: DNR\n\nSome see a player flagged too many times for personal fouls, while others see one with the kind of relentlessness they want from a defensive lineman. His best season came in 2023, with 10.5 tackles for loss and two blocked kicks, but he also added 5.5 tackles for loss as part of a deep D-line rotation in 2024.\n\n52. Jack Bech, WR, TCU\n\nHeight: 6-1 | Weight: 214 | 40 time: DNR\n\nBech's best seasons came in his first year (43 catches as a freshman for LSU in 2021) and his last (62 catches for 1,034 yards and nine touchdowns in 2024). He consistently creates separation at the top of the route and regularly wins in contested-catch situations. Bech had a big Senior Bowl week and was the game's MVP.\n\n53. Elijah Arroyo, TE, Miami\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 250 | 40 time: DNR\n\nLike Bech, Arroyo had a big week at the Senior Bowl. There are big questions around his health, given he was out for much of the 2022 and 2023 seasons with a knee injury. But he showed an NFL-level skill set in 2024, as more than 70% of his 35 catches went for first downs or touchdowns.\n\n54. Josaiah Stewart, Edge, Michigan\n\nHeight: 6-1 | Weight: 249 | 40 time: DNR\n\nStewart didn't work out at the combine because of a hamstring injury and chose not to work out at the Wolverines' pro day. But he gives max effort on every play, and his punishing, determined style is easy to spot on tape. He had 47 tackles for loss over four seasons and led the Wolverines with 8.5 sacks in 2024.\n\n55. Bradyn Swinson, Edge, LSU\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 255 | 40 time: DNR\n\nSwinson is an ascending player, as he didn't start more than one game in a season until 2024. He started 12 games last season and led the Tigers with 12 tackles for loss and 8.5 sacks. He didn't work out at the combine or LSU's main pro day.\n\n56. Jayden Higgins, WR, Iowa State\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 214 | 40 time: 4.47\n\nHe's a tough matchup for defensive backs because of his size and enormous catch radius. Higgins projects to play outside or in the slot and averaged 18.5 yards per catch in 2023 and 13.6 yards per catch in 2024. He had only three drops in two seasons at Iowa State after transferring from Eastern Kentucky.\n\n57. Billy Bowman Jr., S, Oklahoma\n\nHeight: 5-10 | Weight: 192 | 40 time: 4.42\n\nFew defensive backs on the board find the ball like Bowman. He had eight interceptions over the past two seasons and returned three for TDs in 2023. He does miss a lot of tackles, but Bowman showed plenty of potential as a nickel defender at the Senior Bowl.\n\n58. Ozzy Trapilo, OT, Boston College\n\nHeight: 6-8 | Weight: 316 | 40 time: 5.21\n\nTrapilo started games at both left and right tackle for the Eagles. Boston College coach Bill O'Brien, a longtime NFL coach, has lauded Trapilo's work in pass protection, where his quality hand work, reach and footwork make him tough for rushers to solve. He could be a starter with more time in the weight room.\n\n59. Marcus Mbow, G/OT, Purdue\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 303 | 40 time: DNR\n\nMbow played right guard in 2022 before starting 18 games at right tackle the past two seasons. Zone-blocking teams will be interested in his movement and awareness, as he consistently makes the right choices in space. Some might move him back to guard, but his skill set is too good to ignore.\n\n60. Kaleb Johnson, RB, Iowa\n\nHeight: 6-1 | Weight: 224 | 40 time: 4.57\n\nHis best attribute is his decisiveness -- Johnson has the size and power to brush off arm tackles and enough speed to create big plays. His 20 runs of at least 20 yards in 2024 were second in the nation, and his 21 rushing TDs were a school record. Pass-protection struggles have some scouts doubting whether he's capable of being a three-down back.\n\n61. T.J. Sanders, DT, South Carolina\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 297 | 40 time: DNR\n\nHe was smaller than many of the blockers he faced in the SEC, but Sanders is rarely knocked off his feet and plays with powerful hands. He should be able to play on multiple fronts and in the interior. He had 16.5 tackles for loss over the past two seasons.\n\n62. Azareye'h Thomas, CB, Florida State\n\nHeight: 6-1 | Weight: 197 | 40 time: 4.60\n\nHis timed speed will concern some, but Thomas knows how to play to his strengths. He consistently ruins pass routes by challenging receivers effectively at the line of scrimmage and down the field. He had just two career interceptions but knocked away 15 passes, including 10 in 2023.\n\n63. Darius Alexander, DT, Toledo\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 305 | 40 time: 4.95\n\nAlexander showed some positional versatility last season and had a quality week at the Senior Bowl against some of the better blockers in this draft. While he lined up inside most of the time, there were pass-rush situations when he played on the edge. He'll turn 25 in August, so Alexander will need to smooth his rough edges quickly, but potential is there.\n\n64. Benjamin Morrison, CB, Notre Dame\n\nHeight: 6-0 | Weight: 193 | 40 time: DNR\n\nMorrison could have been a top-40 player if not for injury concerns. He had left hip surgery in October 2024 and had shoulder surgery last spring. He had nine interceptions combined in 2022 and 2023. Morrison is a smooth player in his transitions and plays with high-end awareness.\n\n65. Jalen Royals, WR, Utah State\n\nHeight: 6-0 | Weight: 205 | 40 time: 4.42\n\nSomewhat hidden on a below-average Mountain West team, Royals averaged 15.2 yards per reception in back-to-back seasons. He had a combined 10 receptions of 50 or more yards in those two years, and he had 55 receptions for 834 yards in seven games in 2024 before a foot injury ended his season.\n\n66. Joshua Farmer, DT, Florida State\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 305 | 40 time: 5.11\n\nAt his best, Farmer plays with power and overwhelms guards and centers. There are several examples of him quickly overpowering his blocker to gain early control on a play. There are questions about Farmer's consistency, as he never exceeded 32 tackles in a season.\n\n67. Jacob Parrish, CB, Kansas State\n\nHeight: 5-10 | Weight: 191 | 40 time: 4.35\n\nHe led the team in pass breakups in the past two seasons, with nine in 2023 and seven in 2024. Some see Parrish as a physical and fluid nickel corner, but he will need to clean up some tackling issues. However, Parrish's route recognition and ability to close on the ball give him a chance to contribute quickly.\n\n68. Jaxson Dart, QB, Ole Miss\n\nHeight: 6-2 | Weight: 223 | 40 time: DNR\n\nHe finished his career as the Rebels' all-time leader in passing yards (10,617) and total offense (12,117). Dart is also a capable runner, rushing for 1,543 yards and 14 touchdowns in his college career. He'll have to clean up his footwork, throw with better anticipation and challenge defenses more outside the numbers to succeed in the NFL.\n\n69. Alfred Collins, DT, Texas\n\nHeight: 6-6 | Weight: 332 | 40 time: DNR\n\nHe was limited to 12 starts between 2021 and 2023, buried behind future NFL players Byron Murphy II and T'Vondre Sweat. Collins started all 16 games for Texas last season and showed untapped potential with 55 tackles, a blocked kick and seven knocked-down passes.\n\n70. Tre Harris, WR, Ole Miss\n\nHeight: 6-2 | Weight: 205 | 40 time: 4.54\n\nHarris has the size-speed combination the NFL likes but will be expected to diversify his route tree after little more than hitches and go routes in the Ole Miss offense. He missed five games this past season but still finished with 1,030 receiving yards and seven touchdowns.\n\n71. Princely Umanmielen, Edge, Ole Miss\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 244 | 40 time: 4.72\n\nUmanmielen is an active player with pop after the snap. He had seven sacks in 12 games at Florida in 2023, with 10.5 sacks in 12 games with the Rebels last season. Over the past two seasons, 28.9% of his tackles have gone for lost yardage. He might be a situational rusher early in his career until he adds more strength.\n\n72. Jaylin Noel, WR, Iowa State\n\nHeight: 5-10 | Weight: 194 | 40 time: 4.39\n\nNoel brings value as a potential kickoff and punt returner (he was the Big 12's Co-Special Teams Player of the Year), and is a receiver who consistently showed some of the best play speed in this class. He plays closer to his timed speed than many others and averaged 14.9 yards per catch last season.\n\n73. Kevin Winston Jr., S, Penn State\n\nHeight: 6-1 | Weight: 215 | 40 time: DNR\n\nWinston is another player whose draft stock was likely impacted by an injury last season -- he suffered a torn right ACL in the Nittany Lions' second game. He led the team in tackles in 2023 with 60. Winston has some assignment bobbles, but he tackles with purpose and can cover tight ends.\n\n74. Aireontae Ersery, OT, Minnesota\n\nHeight: 6-6 | Weight: 331 | 40 time: 5.01\n\nA durable three-year starter who started his final 38 games at left tackle for the Gophers, Ersery is a powerful presence in the run game. NFL teams with a healthy dose of inside zone plays might provide the best fit. Ersery likely projects as a right tackle as a pro.\n\n75. Jordan Burch, Edge, Oregon\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 279 | 40 time: 4.67\n\nHe had 8.5 sacks and knocked down five passes in 10 games last season (he missed four games with injuries). Burch has all of the physical traits defensive coaches want in a pass rusher, but many scouts believe he needs to be more consistent with his effort and production.\n\nplay 0:40 Jordan Burch's NFL draft profile Check out some of the top highlights from Oregon edge rusher Jordan Burch.\n\n76. Tate Ratledge, G, Georgia\n\nHeight: 6-7 | Weight: 308 | 40 time: 4.97\n\nRatledge started parts of four seasons at guard for the Bulldogs but missed most of 2021 with a foot injury and was sidelined for four games last season after ankle surgery. He is a brawler who has battled some of the country's best interior defensive linemen, which should quickly make him an NFL starter.\n\n77. Andrew Mukuba, S, Texas\n\nHeight: 5-11 | Weight: 186 | 40 time: 4.45\n\nHe started at least 10 games in each of his four college seasons. Mukuba plays with strong awareness, totaling five interceptions last season after transferring from Clemson. Some scouts believe he could play slot corner if needed as well as the deep middle. He's a spotty tackler at times, but Mukuba's coverage skills are coveted.\n\n78. Bhayshul Tuten, RB, Virginia Tech\n\nHeight: 5-9 | Weight: 206 | 40 time: 4.32\n\nTuten averaged at least 5 yards per carry in all four of his college seasons -- two at North Carolina A&T, two at Virginia Tech -- topping out at 6.3 yards per carry in 2024. He runs with quality power for his size, and once he's in the open, he closes the deal. But his fumbles -- eight over the past two seasons -- are a red flag.\n\n79. Oluwafemi Oladejo, Edge, UCLA\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 259 | 40 time: DNR\n\nScouts' opinions on Oladejo evolved after he switched from inside linebacker to edge rusher two games into the 2024 season. He ended 2024 with 57 tackles, 13.5 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks. He will need to smooth out some rough edges, but Oladejo has the length and speed to be a quality edge rusher with the physicality of an inside linebacker.\n\n80. Wyatt Milum, G/OT, West Virginia\n\nHeight: 6-7 | Weight: 313 | 40 time: 5.27\n\nA former pitcher who had offers to play collegiate baseball, Milum projects to be a guard as a pro and plays with toughness and savvy in pass protection. He started 43 games over the past four seasons for the Mountaineers -- eight at right tackle, 35 at left tackle.\n\n81. Jonah Savaiinaea, G/OT, Arizona\n\nHeight: 6-4 | Weight: 324 | 40 time: 4.95\n\nSavaiinaea has potential positional versatility given he started games at right guard, left tackle and right tackle with the Wildcats. He likely projects to be a guard as a pro and has the kind of stoutness in pass protection that playcallers want on the interior.\n\n82. Darien Porter, CB, Iowa State\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 195 | 40 time: 4.30\n\nPorter is a special teams ace who could be a real find at cornerback for an ambitious team. He blocked at least one kick in four different seasons, including two last season. He started his college career at receiver and didn't start a game on defense until 2024, but he had three interceptions in his seven starts.\n\n83. Anthony Belton, OT, NC State\n\nHeight: 6-6 | Weight: 336 | 40 time: 5.26\n\nDespite being a three-year starter at left tackle for the Wolfpack, Belton projects as a right tackle in the NFL. His footwork is a little clunky at times, but he can overwhelm defenders when his technique is right.\n\n84. Elic Ayomanor, WR, Stanford\n\nHeight: 6-2 | Weight: 206 | 40 time: 4.44\n\nThe native Canadian is still early in his developmental curve but burst on the scene with a 294-yard performance against Colorado and Travis Hunter in October 2023. Ayomanor tips his hand at times in his routes, but he possesses too much potential to ignore.\n\n85. Charles Grant, OT, William & Mary\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 311 | 40 time: 5.09\n\nGrant might need some time to make the jump from the FCS Coastal Athletic Association to the NFL. But the former wrestler is a four-year college starter and is an intriguing big-framed tackle prospect who has shown quality footwork and hand placement.\n\nplay 0:36 Charles Grant's NFL draft profile Check out some of the top highlights from William & Mary's Charles Grant.\n\n86. Smael Mondon Jr., LB, Georgia\n\nHeight: 6-2 | Weight: 224 | 40 time: 4.58\n\nMondon can be a tough evaluation. Scouts would see him get fooled on play-action or miss a run fit but also consistently fill up the stat sheet against top competition. A three-year starter for the Bulldogs who pursues plays with vigor, Mondon has shown blitzing ability and comfort dropping in coverage. He had surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left foot in the spring of 2024.\n\n87. Harold Fannin Jr., TE, Bowling Green\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 241 | 40 time: 4.71\n\nHe went from 19 receptions as a freshman in 2022 to an FBS-leading 117 receptions last season. Fannin also led the FBS in 2024 with 1,555 receiving yards and scored 10 touchdowns. He looks a little stiff at times, but he catches everything and has shown good run-after-the-catch work. Fannin must show he can consistently win against man coverage to succeed in the NFL.\n\n88. Tyler Shough, QB, Louisville\n\nHeight: 6-5 | Weight: 219 | 40 time: 4.63\n\nThere are question marks around Shough, who started his college career at Oregon in 2018. He will turn 26 in September and missed parts of three seasons with a broken collarbone, broken left leg and a left shoulder injury. But he has a quality arm, works the entire field and understands coverages. He needs to get rid of the ball quicker and maintain his mechanics under duress.\n\n89. Chris Paul Jr., LB, Ole Miss\n\nHeight: 6-1 | Weight: 222 | 40 time: 4.63\n\nHe's the size of a big safety, so Paul will need to add bulk if he's going to be a weakside linebacker. But he's active and sound in his assignments, and his 2024 season -- 88 tackles, 11 tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks and an interception -- against SEC competition can't be dismissed.\n\n90. Ashton Gillotte, Edge, Louisville\n\nHeight: 6-3 | Weight: 264 | 40 time: 4.65\n\nHe consistently affects the pocket -- 15.5 sacks over the past two seasons to go with 24.5 tackles for loss -- and plays with savvy power. He works the edge with balance, and his active hands make it difficult for blockers to get in the first punch. Gillotte could fit a 4-3 or a 3-4."}

But, after replacing Conor Bradley in the 71st minute, Alexander-Arnold produced a moment of magic just five minutes later with a left-footed volley firing past Mads Hermansen in the Foxes’ net.\n\nHis celebration caught the eye as the full-back whipped his top off and burst towards the away fans, causing some speculation over a potential U-Turn that would see him remain at Liverpool after this season, despite being expected to join Real Madrid upon the expiry of his contract in June.\n\nHowever, that won’t be the case according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, who has revealed that the move is on the verge of being completed.\n\n‘Final Stages’\n\nSpeaking on his YouTube channel, Romano said: “The agreement between Trent Alexander-Arnold and Real Madrid is yet to be completed in terms of signing the contract, but verbally is at the final stages.”\n\n“Expected to be Here We Go” – as quoted by @LFCTransferRoom.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LFCTransferRoom/status/1913914233420447902\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, Liverpool have confirmed new contracts for both Mohamed Salah and Virgil Van Dijk in deals that will keep the star duo at the club until at least 2027.\n\nHowever, it’s starting to look more and more likely that won’t be the case for Alexander-Arnold, who will leave his boyhood club at the end of the season.\n\nAs it stands, Trent will leave as a two-time Premier League winner, two-time Carabao Cup winner, a UEFA Champions League winner, an FA Cup winner, a UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup winner.\n\nHis goal winner against Leicester City will join the long list of memorable moments since coming through the ranks and into the first-team back in 2016.\n\nWhether his future lies at Liverpool or not, the most important thing is getting this 20th league title over the line and there’s no doubt that Alexander-Arnold will continue to play a big part in that, like he has all season."}

In the latest Daily Red podcast for Anfield Index, Dave Davis unpacks a fresh round of speculation surrounding the future of Liverpool’s No. 66. With Real Madrid frequently linked and fans on edge, the question now is: is Trent staying at Liverpool after all?\n\nUproar Over Tour Guide Whisper\n\nIt’s not every day that a stadium tour guide sets the fanbase ablaze. Yet, that’s exactly what happened when a father taking his daughters around Anfield overheard a casual mention from a tour guide. As Dave recounted:\n\n“One of the guys talked about the great news and he thought he meant Virgil’s contract… then said no, Trent. So I said ‘Oh, he’s going for sure then.’ And looked to me and implied he’d heard he was staying after all.”\n\nThe ripple effects were immediate. Social media pounced, forums lit up, and speculation surged like a spring tide.\n\n“People seem to be basing into it genuinely, honest—absolutely nothing on it,” Dave cautioned, striking a sceptical but hopeful tone.\n\nTier Anfield Tour Guide: Legend or Wind-Up Merchant?\n\nThe origin of the rumour lies with an account dubbed “Tier Anfield Tour Guide”, now elevated to folk-hero status or dismissed as master troll, depending on your outlook.\n\n“This guy has now either pegged himself level with Indykaila or it’s the greatest blag account ever,” Dave quipped. “There’s no in-between.”\n\nWhile Dave Davis confessed he hadn’t “heard anything on it at all,” he didn’t dismiss the emotional pull of the notion:\n\n“I would love it to be true… of course we want Trent to renew. Of course we do.”\n\nLove Hearts, Likes, and Instagram Hype\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, Kostas Tsimikas recently posted a photo featuring Trent with a love heart emoji, celebrating his return to training. Simultaneously, fans clocked Trent’s sudden reappearance on Instagram after a long absence.\n\nDave’s take?\n\n“People jumped on that one as well, didn’t they?”\n\nThe implication: fans are desperate for clues, and even the smallest social media nudge is read like a sacred text. Still, caution ruled the day:\n\n“I wouldn’t get too excited on this… I hope I’m wildly wrong as I say that.”\n\nTrent on the Bench: What Slot Said\n\nSo where does Arne Slot, Liverpool’s current manager, stand? For now, the official line is that Trent will be on the bench against Leicester, according to Slot’s Friday press conference. Not quite a decisive U-turn, but hardly a farewell lap either.\n\n“We’ll have to wait there,” Dave said, “but is it a Trent U-turn?”\n\nIn his own words, the podcast host summed it up best:\n\n“Who knows… we probably won’t have to wait too long to find out in that regard.”\n\nReal Madrid or Red Forever?\n\nSpeculation about Trent Alexander-Arnold joining Real Madrid has always carried a sting. A Scouser born and bred, a player who’s lifted the Champions League in red, and one of the club’s modern icons—it’s little wonder the mere hint of his departure unsettles supporters.\n\nBut if whispers from a tour guide, emojis from teammates, and Insta-activity are anything to go by, there’s at least a flicker of hope that Trent stays at Liverpool.\n\nWhether this is a full-blown Trent U-turn or just the latest episode in a saga of speculation remains to be seen. But one thing’s for sure: Liverpool fans will be watching this one as closely as they watch the title race."}

Mentioned on the Daily Red podcast hosted by Dave Davis for Anfield Index, the Juventus midfielder, currently on loan at Lazio, is now being linked to a potential move to Anfield.\n\nDavis didn’t spend long on Rovella, but what he did say was enough to raise eyebrows — especially when he bracketed him with none other than Martín Zubimendi, the Real Sociedad midfielder Liverpool pursued last summer.\n\nDefensive Metrics Make the Difference\n\n“This kid has been compared directly to two players that Liverpool have looked at in recent times — Lazar Samardžić… and also Martín Zubimendi,” Davis said.\n\nThe numbers back that comparison. According to Davis, Rovella’s stats this season with Lazio are solid across multiple key areas, particularly from a defensive standpoint:\n\n“92nd percentile for interceptions — that’s pretty hot, by the way. 86 for tackles.”\n\nThat level of activity in breaking up play is precisely what Liverpool’s midfield has often lacked in the absence of a peak Fabinho. And with Wataru Endō not seen as a long-term solution, options like Rovella now carry weight.\n\nNot Just a Ball-Winner\n\nDavis was quick to point out that Rovella isn’t just a disruptor. His distribution from the middle of the park is just as tidy:\n\n“91st percentile for passes — that’s brilliant. Pass completion rate as well, 89.3% in the middle.”\n\nThe comparisons to Zubimendi aren’t just theoretical. Zubimendi’s passing control, composure in tight spaces and ability to control tempo are all mirrored — if not equalled — in Rovella’s numbers, based on what Davis presented.\n\n“That’s why we looked at Zubimendi, isn’t it? That pass completion rate.”\n\nAn Under-the-Radar Option?\n\nIn typical Liverpool fashion, Rovella would represent a quieter signing. There’s no public courting, no agent pushing leaks to the media. Just a player with the right mix of age, numbers and style — and a price that won’t likely hit Zubimendi levels.\n\n“This is one where you could say, ‘another midfielder and all this’, but this kid…” Davis paused before outlining why Rovella fits the profile.\n\nAt 23, with experience in both Serie A and European competition, Rovella may not be a headline name, but he’s the sort of midfielder that Liverpool have often targeted: functional, adaptable, and just under the elite radar.\n\nOne to Watch\n\nWhile there’s no suggestion a deal is imminent, Rovella’s name now joins the wider conversation about Liverpool’s midfield rebuild. And as Davis summed up:\n\n“You could absolutely see why Liverpool would like this guy.”\n\nIn a summer that will likely involve both outgoings and calculated incomings, Nicolò Rovella may yet prove to be one of the most realistic and clever links of the window — if Liverpool choose to move."}

Arne Slot’s side sit on the brink of something big, and a win at the King Power Stadium could push them even closer—especially if results elsewhere go their way.\n\nTrent’s Touch and Go Return\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold hasn’t pulled on a Liverpool shirt since that gut-wrenching Champions League exit to PSG on penalties back in March. That night at Anfield saw the right-back limp off with an ankle injury, and he’s missed four games since—three in the Premier League, plus the Carabao Cup final loss to Newcastle.\n\nBut there’s a flicker of good news. He’s trained this week, tentatively at first, and might be back on the bench against Leicester. Starting? No chance, says Slot.\n\n“Trent is coming back from an injury, he trained with us yesterday and every time he plays with us and trains with us he shows his commitment,” said the manager on Friday.\n\n“He has worked so hard to be back already now… He has worked so hard during the whole season and now during his rehab to be back with the team again.”\n\nSlot was clear—Trent’s still not match sharp.\n\n“[He is] not [ready] to start but if things go well today and tomorrow, he might – might – be on the bench… So it would be nice if Trent is with us during the weekend, yes.”\n\nWith Joe Gomez still recovering from hamstring surgery, and Conor Bradley only just back from injury himself, Liverpool will be hoping Alexander-Arnold’s recovery keeps heading in the right direction.\n\nInjury Updates and Selection Calls\n\nThe injury list is starting to ease, but choices remain tight. Joe Gomez is still out, while Darwin Núñez is expected to return after illness ruled him out of the late win over West Ham.\n\nBradley filled in well at right-back against the Hammers and could start again, but asking him to go the full 90 after a lengthy layoff is a risk. Having Trent on the bench gives Slot a safety net.\n\nOn the left, Andy Robertson is likely to come back in for Kostas Tsimikas. Further up the pitch, Dominik Szoboszlai will be hoping for a recall after being benched in favour of Curtis Jones last time out.\n\nEyes on the Prize\n\nIf Liverpool beat Leicester and Arsenal slip up at Ipswich earlier on Sunday, the title could be theirs—with five matches to spare.

Dominik Szoboszlai, speaking to LFC Official Website ahead of the Reds’ trip to Leicester, captured this quiet intensity with striking clarity.\n\n“It’s very important to be just calm,” the Hungarian midfielder stated, “focus on Leicester [and] don’t even think about what Arsenal does.”\n\nIn many ways, his sentiment reflects a broader truth about this Liverpool side under Arne Slot. The drama and dazzling flair that once defined Jürgen Klopp’s version of the Reds has given way to a side built on control, clarity, and quiet conviction. There’s an absence of noise, but no shortage of purpose.\n\nControl Is the New Chaos\n\nThe permutations are tantalising. Six points from six games are all that separate Liverpool from officially reclaiming the Premier League crown. Should they win at Leicester and Arsenal stumble at Ipswich earlier in the day, it could be decided as early as Sunday. But Szoboszlai’s words steer away from the hypotheticals.\n\n“You have to focus on yourself,” he said. “Because it is in your own hand and you have to be happy that it is only in your hand.”\n\nThere is something mature—almost surgical—about this mindset. It is a stark contrast to previous title chases drenched in adrenaline and emotional chaos. Now, Liverpool speak with the poise of champions-elect, not pretenders.\n\nSzoboszlai, who has quietly accumulated 43 appearances and seven goals this season, has embodied this composure on the pitch. His blend of positional discipline and creative bursts has added a layer of fluidity to a side.\n\nReflection on a Relentless Season\n\nThe midfielder’s post-match candour offered a candid reflection of the campaign so far: “Unbelievable,” he said. “Ups and downs: being first in the Champions League group stage and then [going] out against Paris [Saint-Germain], went to the Carabao Cup final [and] lost against Newcastle.”\n\nIt’s easy to gloss over these moments when silverware is within reach, but Szoboszlai’s account is honest. This season hasn’t just been a crescendo of wins—it’s included sharp disappointments. Yet that adversity, more than the brilliance, might define how this side finally crosses the line.\n\nIn essence, Liverpool have turned those setbacks into fuel. The pain of defeat to PSG and heartbreak at Wembley haven’t derailed the mission; they’ve fortified it.\n\nSquad Unity and City-Wide Drive\n\nSzoboszlai made a point to include not just the players, but everyone involved. “Everybody was involved somehow – from the players, from the staff, from the fans, from the city, from everybody.”\n\nThat’s not just lip service. It’s a theme deeply woven into Liverpool’s identity: unity. It’s the old Shankly principle of everyone pulling in the same direction, whether they’re in the technical area or the terraces.\n\nThere are still hurdles, notably an unpredictable Leicester side and the tightrope of pressure that defines run-ins. But with voices like Szoboszlai’s at the heart of this dressing room, calmness—rather than chaos—feels like Liverpool’s sharpest weapon.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index\n\nFor fans, Szoboszlai’s interview will hit all the right notes. His measured tone and refusal to be distracted by Arsenal’s results show a player who truly gets what it means to wear the Liverpool shirt.\n\nSupporters will particularly admire how he doesn’t shy away from mentioning the lows—the PSG exit and the Carabao Cup loss—because those moments mattered too. They’ve shaped the team’s resilience.\n\nThis isn’t a side riding a wave of good fortune. It’s one that’s built something sustainable, and Szoboszlai has been a vital part of that. At 23, he’s already sounding like a future captain. His message to the fans is clear: trust the process, stay focused, and don’t celebrate until the job’s done."}

But if you’re expecting Liverpool to enter a bidding war, think again. On the latest episode of the Daily Red podcast for Anfield Index, host Dave Davis laid it out with clinical certainty: Ekitike won’t be wearing red if Eintracht Frankfurt’s €100 million price tag holds.\n\nNo Interest at That Price\n\nThe French forward, currently on the books at Eintracht Frankfurt after a loan and eventual exit from PSG, has had his name linked with a host of top clubs across Europe. But for Liverpool, the reality is simple.\n\n“If the fee for Hugo Ekitike is £88 million (€100m), I guarantee you there’s not a chance in hell Liverpool are in at that price,” said Davis.\n\nIt wasn’t just an offhand remark either. Davis was crystal clear that this is not how Liverpool operate in the transfer market:\n\n“Liverpool, as we know the way they operate, always set a top marker… I’d be surprised if it’s above anything like £60 million.”\n\nThe implication? If Frankfurt want to do business with the Reds, they’ll need to come down — way down.\n\nAgent Activity Raises Flags\n\nAccording to Davis, much of the Ekitike noise has been driven by the player’s representatives rather than by concrete club interest:\n\n“His agent and his agency have been really driving the talk, leaking all and everything about Hugo to Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle.”\n\nThis heavy-handed push from the agent’s side appears to be in direct conflict with how Liverpool like to go about their business.\n\n“Usually if Liverpool are doing it, it’s under wraps. The agent’s not shouting about it, they’re being told to keep it quiet.”\n\nThat disconnect is often enough to take a name off the shortlist.\n\nNot Worth The Fee\n\nEkitike’s performances have been watched. Davis confirmed as much, saying:\n\n“We’ve watched him enough… the two Spurs games, quite a few in their league.”\n\nBut watching isn’t buying — especially not at inflated prices:\n\n“€100 million euros? Absolutely not a chance… Not even worth £60 million.”\n\nHe went on to suggest that clubs are “getting carried away a bit” with the valuation, possibly off the back of inflated markets and player potential rather than present output.\n\nLiverpool’s Transfer Logic Remains Firm\n\nWhile other clubs may be swayed by hype or agent-driven campaigns, Liverpool’s approach remains rooted in value and discretion. The club has a history of walking away from inflated deals — and it looks like Ekitike is next on that list.\n\nDavis didn’t leave any ambiguity:\n\n“He is not in the mix for the Reds as a number nine anymore.”\n\nSo, for those hoping to see Ekitike at Anfield next season, don’t hold your breath. Unless Frankfurt shift drastically on price, this is a door Liverpool will leave firmly shut."}

That familiar blend of humility, ambition, and pure love for the club shines through in every quote.\n\n“It would be really special if we can get over the line,” he told BBC Sport NI. That ‘if’ still matters, even with Liverpool 13 points clear at the summit of the Premier League, needing just two wins from six to be crowned champions. But Bradley doesn’t get carried away.\n\nThis season has been stop-start for the Northern Irishman, disrupted by injury yet punctuated by moments of real impact — including a memorable Champions League night against Real Madrid where he crunched into a challenge on Kylian Mbappé, showcasing both his fearlessness and his defensive mettle.\n\nAs Bradley put it: “It’s been a bit of a frustrating year for me with injuries, but I am really happy to be back… hopefully I can help as much as I can and bring the Premier League home.”\n\nFrom Tyrone to Anfield: The Road Less Travelled\n\nThere is a poetic quality to Bradley’s journey. A Liverpool fan since childhood, now pulling on the shirt with pride, and doing so in a season that could end with the club’s second league title in over three decades. It’s a narrative that mirrors so many supporters’ dreams — only Bradley is living it.\n\n“When you join a club like Liverpool you dream of winning the Premier League… bringing home the Premier League would be so special.”\n\nWith Trent Alexander-Arnold’s future still uncertain, Bradley’s own place in the Liverpool machine becomes ever more significant. He is not just a promising deputy — he is a potential heir. And with contract negotiations reportedly underway, the club seems to share that belief.\n\n“I just want to keep working really hard… and keep bringing trophies home if possible.”\n\nFocus on Football, Not the Finish Line\n\nLiverpool could lift the title this weekend if results fall their way. A win at Leicester combined with an Arsenal slip against Ipswich would crown them early.\n\nYet Bradley remains firmly grounded: “We have just got to keep playing our football… hopefully if we can do that for a few more games we should have it won.”\n\nThere’s something deeply refreshing about that mindset. Not complacency, nor over-excitement — just a steely sense of purpose. It’s the same mentality Arne Slot has instilled in his squad since day one. Quiet confidence, measured ambition.\n\nBradley may not be the loudest voice in the room, but he speaks like someone who understands what this club means, both to himself and to millions of others.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index\n\nConor Bradley is quickly becoming more than just a promising talent — he’s shaping up as a cultural fit for the club in the way Scousers appreciate most: hard-working, humble, and quietly passionate.\n\nHis comments to BBC Sport NI strike the perfect note. He doesn’t shout for attention. He doesn’t make the moment about him. But it’s evident he feels the weight of Liverpool’s hopes as deeply as any fan on the Kop.\n\nFrom a supporter’s perspective, the excitement around Bradley is twofold. First, he’s come through tough injuries and still looks ready to step up when needed. Second, with Trent’s contract situation still in flux, there’s a growing sense of comfort knowing the right flank has serious talent waiting in the wings.\n\nHe might not be the star name yet, but if Liverpool do lift the title this season, it’ll be players like Bradley — the steady, selfless squad members — who’ve helped make it possible. His future at the club looks bright, and more importantly, it looks red."}

The car is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 linked to an eight-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential and equipped with the Technology Group, the Plus Package, a competition suspension, Brembo brake calipers, 20″ Warp-Speed wheels, HID Air-Catcher headlamps, and widebody fenders. The interior features heated and ventilated front seats, adaptive cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Harman Kardon sound system, and Uconnect infotainment with navigation. Acquired by the seller in 2024, this Black Ghost has 86 miles and is now offered with a clean Carfax report and a Michigan title.\n\nThe Black Ghost was the sixth of seven Last Call special editions, and all 300 cars in it were finished in Pitch Black with a white stripe and a faux-alligator-skin roof graphic. Additional features include HID Air-Catcher headlamps, widebody fenders, an aluminum hood with dual air scoops, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, and dual exhaust outlets finished in Black Vapor chrome. The seller notes that in its capacity as a promotional vehicle, this car would have received Dodge’s “auto spa” treatment as outlined in this Dodge Garage article.\n\nSatin Carbon 20″ Warp-Speed wheels are mounted with 305/35 Pirelli P Zero All Season tires. The car is equipped with a Widebody competition suspension system with adaptive Bilstein dampers. Braking is handled by black-finished six-piston front and four-piston rear Brembo calipers.\n\nThe heated and ventilated front seats are upholstered in Black Laguna leather and Alcantara with embossed Hellcat logos on the front backrests, and carbon-fiber trim accents the instrument panel and center console. Amenities include driver-seat power adjustability, a folding rear seat, keyless entry, push-button start, adaptive cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Harman Kardon high-performance sound system, and a Uconnect infotainment system with navigation.\n\nThe Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel is mounted to a tilting and telescoping column and frames a red 220-mph speedometer, 7k-rpm tachometer, and a configurable digital display with an odometer that indicates 86 miles.\n\nThe supercharged high-output 6.2-liter Hemi V8 features a high-performance engine controller as part of the Black Ghost configuration for a factory-rated output of 807 horsepower and 707 lb-ft of torque.

Speaking passionately on the Redmen TV podcast, Lynch drew attention to the emotional, tactical, and symbolic layers underpinning the result.\n\nLeicester’s Form Didn’t Mean a Comfortable Ride\n\nFacing a Leicester side “who had lost 10 of the last 11” and hadn’t scored a home goal in the Premier League since December, many anticipated a straightforward match for Arne Slot’s Liverpool. Yet, Lynch was quick to highlight the club’s penchant for drama.\n\n“We should have known, shouldn’t we, that Liverpool don’t do it easy.”\n\nDespite dominating possession and the shot count, the Reds found it difficult to convert. “Liverpool 28 shots, Leicester 5. Liverpool 10 on target, Leicester 0,” Lynch said, underscoring the frustration in the final third.\n\nStats Highlight Liverpool’s Total Dominance\n\nWhile some critics might point to Liverpool’s inefficiency, Lynch dismissed any notion that this was a poor performance.\n\n“Although Liverpool didn’t put their chances away… they played really well.”\n\nCiting an expected goals figure of 2.62 for Liverpool and just 0.25 for Leicester, he noted the result could have been far more emphatic were it not for bad luck and committed defending from the hosts.\n\nTrent’s Decisive Moment and the Celebration That Spoke Volumes\n\nThe decisive goal came from Trent Alexander-Arnold, a moment met with jubilation on and off the pitch. But it was the celebration – intense and directly in front of the travelling fans – that sparked speculation. “The nature of his celebration… the enthusiasm… addressed the away end.”\n\nLynch revealed that Trent offered only a cautious hint post-match when asked about his future: “I’ve said all season I’m not getting into my situation. These days are special.”\n\nWhile this suggests nothing definitive, Lynch remarked: “It still feels very much nailed on that he is going to leave… this is soon going to become a memory.”\n\nAttack Shows Why Slot Might Want to Rebuild\n\nLiverpool may top the league in goals, but Lynch believes the attacking line still needs reshaping.\n\n“Slot has masked it very well… but I do wonder whether you just think he needs a few more killers in that attack.”\n\nHe critiqued the over-reliance on Salah, referencing decisions like using Luis Díaz out of position and the absence of Federico Chiesa, adding: “The writing’s on the wall for him… he’s not going to make it at Anfield.”\n\nHe also hinted at deeper issues: “Darwin Nunez… clear suggestion there’s been a bit of a falling out there on the training ground.”\n\nAlexis Mac Allister: Liverpool’s Most Important Midfielder\n\nAmong the positives, Alexis Mac Allister earned particular praise. “Five out of nine ground duels won, three out of three tackles, six recoveries, three chances created.”\n\nLynch described him simply as: “Liverpool’s most important midfielder… so good on both sides of the ball.”\n\nTitle Inevitable – But When Will It Be Clinched?\n\nWith Arsenal facing Crystal Palace next, the Premier League title could be confirmed midweek. Still, Lynch has a personal preference: “It would be quite nice if Liverpool could go into that Tottenham game with a chance to go and win it themselves.”\n\nRegardless of when it’s secured, the title is in touching distance."}

TOPIC_ARN ; for ( const finding of findings ) { try { const chatbotMessage = { version : \"0\" , id : finding . Id || ` finding- ${ Date . now ( ) } ` , \"detail-type\" : \"Security Hub Findings - Imported\" , source : \"aws.securityhub\" , account : finding . AwsAccountId || event . account , time : new Date ( ) . toISOString ( ) , region : finding . Region || event . region , resources : finding . Resources ? finding . Resources . map ( ( r : any ) => r . Id ) : [ ] , detail : { findings : [ finding ] } } ; await snsClient . send ( new PublishCommand ( { TopicArn : topicArn , Subject : ` Security Alert:開発環境 ${ finding . Title . substring ( 0 , 80 ) } ` , Message : JSON . stringify ( chatbotMessage ) } ) ) ; } catch ( error ) { console . error ( 'Error sending SNS message:' , error ) ; } } } ;\n\nハマりポイント\n\n過去の記事で実装したLambda関数では、SNSトピックへ送信するメッセージを単純なテキスト形式で設定していました。しかし、Amazon Q Developer in chat applicationsと連携する場合、この方法では通知が届かないという問題に直面しました。\n\n動作しない例\n\n下記のようなプレーンテキスト形式では通知が届きませんでした。\n\nawait snsClient . send ( new PublishCommand ( { TopicArn : topicArn , Subject : ` Security Alert:開発環境 ${ finding . Title . substring ( 0 , 90 ) } ` , Message : ` Severity: ${ finding . Severity . Label }\n\nResource: ${ finding . Resources [ 0 ] ?. Id || 'Unknown' } ` } ) ) ;\n\n解決策\n\nSNSトピックへ通知するメッセージで、EventBridge形式のJSONオブジェクトを作成し、それをJSON.stringify()でシリアライズしました。この形式に変更することで、Security Hubのアラートが正しくSlackチャンネルに通知されるようになりました。\n\n動作確認\n\n設定が正しく機能しているか確認するため、下記の手順でテストを実施しました。\n\nテスト手順\n\nSecurity Hubコンソールにアクセスし、重要度「MEDIUM」以上の検出結果を選択 選択したアラートのワークフローステータスを「通知済み」に変更 アラートを手動で通知\n\n結果\n\nテスト実行後、SlackチャンネルにSecurity Hubアラート通知がAmazon Qアプリを介して届きました！\n\n通知は見やすく整形され、重要な情報が一目でわかるようになっています。\n\n\n\nおわりに\n\n今回ご紹介したAmazon Q Developer in chat applicationsを使用したSlack連携によって、チームが日常的に目にするコミュニケーションツール上でセキュリティアラートを受け取ることができるようになります。Lambda関数を使用したWebhook実装と比較して、簡易的に実装できました。\n\nさらに、Amazon Q Developer in chat applicationsを使用することで、通知を受け取るだけでなく、Slackチャンネル内から直接AWSリソースに対してコマンドを実行することも可能になります。\n\n皆様のAWS環境のセキュリティ向上に少しでもお役に立てれば幸いです。"}

Aaron vs. Aaron: After two weeks on the job, coach Aaron Glenn fired a future Hall of Fame quarterback -- not the cushiest way to break into the new gig. Details of that Feb. 6 confab with Aaron Rodgers have come to light, courtesy of Rodgers, who said on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on Thursday that Glenn disrespected him. Their meeting was quick and cold and became combative, according to Rodgers.\n\nYes, there's a new boss and a new vibe at One Jets Drive. Hugs and happy talk are out; hard truth and no-nonsense are in.\n\n\"With A.G., he's going to do it a certain way -- a way he believes in,\" former Jets quarterback Chad Pennington said this week before Rodgers went public. \"I think that's one of his strong points. That's what made him a great DB. He had a certain way of doing things and he's a true professional, so it doesn't surprise me that it correlates to him being a coach as well.\"\n\nPennington was Glenn's teammate in 2000 and 2001, as were Shaun Ellis, John Abraham and Anthony Becht -- the Jets' four first-round draft picks in 2000. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the draft -- the only time in NFL history that team made four first-round choices in the same year -- the four appeared as guests on ESPN's \"Flight Deck\" podcast.\n\nWhen Glenn came up in the conversation, his former teammates described a highly focused, serious-minded person who isn't afraid to upset the status quo.\n\nGlenn has transformed the Jets into \"a tight ship,\" according to Becht, who added, \"He's going to make sure they weed out anything that shouldn't be around to keep it very tight inside, so that only the players and coaches uniformly come together for the single purpose of turning that organization around.\"\n\nHe did that with Rodgers rather quickly, summoning him to New Jersey for a chat a few days before the Super Bowl. The four-time MVP flew on his private jet from California, expecting a long discussion about his future. Glenn cut to the chase, handing Rodgers a pink slip less than a minute into the conversation, per the quarterback. It was quicker than his ill-fated debut in 2023 that lasted four snaps.\n\nMaybe Glenn should've expressed more compassion, but he acted decisively and showed he's thinking like a head coach, not an ex-player. Former players sometimes fall into the trap of getting too cozy with their players; it appears that won't happen with Glenn, though his occasionally prickly personality might chafe some feelings along the way.\n\nThe way Rodgers explained it, Glenn seemed concerned that his presence on the team would undermine his authority. If true, that could be perceived as a sign of insecurity, but let's be honest: Glenn wouldn't have been the first coach to see Rodgers as a distraction.\n\n\"He's going to have the players different, man,\" Abraham said of Glenn. \"I just hope they give him the time to build this team.\"\n\nEllis said of his old teammate: \"My memories of him are coming into the locker room, always seeing him smiling and laughing and joking. But when it came to the meeting rooms, he was on his stuff. He knew exactly what to do. Seeing him [coaching], I'm not surprised at all.\"\n\nQuarterback Aaron Rodgers opened up about his very-brief exit meeting with the Jets. Jasen Vinlove/Imagn Images\n\n2. Latest draft buzz: The popular mock draft choice for the Jets at seventh overall is Missouri right tackle Armand Membou, whose stock has risen since an impressive combine performance. But what if Membou is off the board? There's a chance he could be picked No. 6 by the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nIn that case, the Jets could opt for Penn State tight end Tyler Warren or Texas tackle Kelvin Banks Jr. -- a name that hasn't garnered much buzz in the top 10.\n\nBanks (6-foot-5, 315 pounds) won the Lombardi Award (best lineman in college football) and Outland Trophy (best interior lineman) in 2024. His background at left tackle (three-year starter) provides more value than Membou, according to some NFL evaluators.\n\nObviously, the Jets would have no qualms about shifting Banks (or Olu Fashanu) to right tackle if they go in this direction. Banks is generally regarded as a mid- to late first-round prospect; maybe they could get him in a trade-down.\n\nWarren is intriguing because of his production (104 receptions for 1,233 yards in 2024) and versatility, not to mention the Jets' crying need at tight end. They covet a No. 2 option in the passing game to reduce the pressure on wide receiver Garrett Wilson.\n\n3. Hometown connection: Picking Banks would hit close to home for Glenn -- literally.\n\nBanks grew up in Humble, Texas, the same hometown as the coach. They attended different high schools, though. Banks' father, Kelvin Sr., also was raised in the same area. He, too, went to a different high school than Glenn. Kelvin Sr. was an offensive lineman who began his college career at the Houston.\n\n4. A 320-pound question mark: Speaking of right tackles, Chukwuma Okorafor was an intriguing addition in free agency. He has 60 career starts, including 59 with the Pittsburgh Steelers, yet he arrived with a red flag because of what went down last season with the New England Patriots.\n\nHe opened the season as their starting left tackle, but he allowed three quarterback pressures to Cincinnati Bengals star Trey Hendrickson and got benched after 12 snaps. Abruptly, Okorafor left the team and never played again for the Patriots, who cut him this offseason.\n\nIn 2023, Okorafor ranked 12th out of 40 right tackles in pressure percentage, per Next Gen Stats -- but carries the stigma of having walked away from a team. Glenn said they did \"a good amount of investigation\" into the situation and came away satisfied after speaking directly with Okorafor.\n\n\"I think he's a really good player,\" Glenn said. \"We're trying to build this O-line to be dynamic, and we feel like he could be a piece of that puzzle.\"\n\n5. Heeere's Darren: General manager Darren Mougey steps into the spotlight this week. He has no drafting history because it's his first time in the big chair, so it's hard to predict what might happen.\n\nMinnesota Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell, a former college teammate at San Diego State, praised Mougey's personnel acumen.\n\n\"He's somebody I always really, really valued -- his opinion on players, putting together a team, scheme, all that stuff,\" O'Connell told ESPN at the recent annual league meetings. \"I think he's going to do a phenomenal job in that role.\"\n\n6. Did you know? The Jets have made 625 player selections in the common-draft era (since 1967), and not once have they picked a player at No. 7 overall. That ends Thursday, barring a trade.\n\nBy the way, the Jets are open to trading back, per league sources.\n\n7. More beef wanted: The Jets hosted no fewer than four defensive tackles for visits -- Mason Graham (Michigan), Derrick Harmon (Oregon), Darius Alexander (Toledo) and Omarr Norman-Lott (Tennessee). Despite signing three low-cost free agents, they're still looking to upgrade. They need more size in the middle.\n\n8. A curious comp: In the past five seasons, only one player in the league -- Jets linebacker Neville Hewitt -- played more than 50% of his team's snaps (offense and defense combined). He played 51% in 2020 on a Jets team that had the second-most defensive snaps. Why are we bringing this up?\n\nAaron Rodgers last season with Jets Aaron Rodgers finished 25th in QBR last season (48.2), the second-worst mark of his career, behind only the last time he started multiple games in 2022. He also averaged career lows in yards per attempt and yards per dropback. Rank QBR 48.2 25th Yards per attempt 6.7* 28th Yards per dropback 5.8* 27th * Career lows\n\n-- ESPN Research\n\nThere's a lot of talk about Travis Hunter playing both ways in the NFL, as he did at Colorado, where he played 86% of his team's snaps last season. The Hewitt reference gives some context to what Hunter hopes to accomplish.\n\nBet you didn't expect to see Hunter and Hewitt in the same sentence.\n\n9. A familiar farewell: Tyron Smith, who retired Wednesday in a news conference at the Dallas Cowboys, failed to mention the Jets in his retirement speech. Granted, last season was his only one in New York, but the Jets did pay him $9.25 million when no other team was banging down his door. Smith joins a long list of fading greats who played out the string with the Jets, a group that includes Rodgers, Ed Reed and Art Monk.\n\n10. Busy week: Starting Monday, the Jets will hold a minicamp. Teams with new coaches are allowed to have a minicamp before the draft. This one is voluntary, which means a player could skip it to take a vacation in, say, Egypt, and not be fined."}

It is, however, designed to meet certain requirements that the U.S. government instituted in order to sell the chips in China.\n\nEven as the trade war between the U.S. and China continues to ramp up, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the company will still work with China during his visit to the country.\n\n\"The increased restrictions have impacted our company significantly,\" Huang said on CCTV. \"Growing up in China, I’ve seen how the country has watched us grow over the last 30 years. Of course, it’s a very large market, and our interactions with and work serving Chinese companies have made us better. We will continue to make significant efforts to optimize our products to comply with regulations and continue serving the Chinese market.\"\n\nNvidia CEO Pledges to Continue Serving Chinese Market - YouTube Watch On\n\nA terrible time with tariffs.\n\nNvidia lost more than $270 billion in market value since the Trump tariffs, although it got off easier compared to Apple, which lost $700 billion. And like Apple, Nvidia is working to try to avoid dealing with Trump's tariffs by manufacturing its products in the U.S.\n\nJust days before filing that it was going to take a $5.5 billion hit, the company pledged that it would invest $500 billion into U.S. manufacturing, according to a press release from The White House.\n\nGet The Snapshot, our free newsletter on the future of computing Sign up to receive The Snapshot, a free special dispatch from Laptop Mag, in your inbox.

These highly anticipated updates are expected to introduce notable advancements, particularly for iPadOS, which may adopt features that bring it closer to macOS while maintaining the distinct roles of iPads and Macs. A central focus of the discussion surrounding these updates has been device compatibility, with reports suggesting that older devices may no longer be supported. Here’s a detailed look at what you can expect from these upcoming operating systems. The video below from iDeviceHelp gives us more details.\n\niPadOS 19: Enhancing Productivity and Functionality\n\niPadOS 19 is poised to be one of the most impactful updates in Apple’s history, with rumors indicating a significant shift in its functionality. The update is expected to bring iPads closer to macOS in terms of multitasking and productivity tools, making them more versatile for professional use. This evolution could redefine how users interact with their iPads, offering enhanced capabilities for tasks such as document editing, creative workflows, and multitasking, while still retaining the simplicity that appeals to casual users.\n\nDevice compatibility for iPadOS 19 is expected to focus on newer hardware, making sure that the advanced features perform seamlessly. This approach reflects Apple’s commitment to delivering a high-quality user experience without compromising performance on older devices.\n\niPad Mini: 5th generation or later\n\n5th generation or later iPad: 8th generation or later\n\n8th generation or later iPad Air: 3rd generation or later\n\n3rd generation or later iPad Pro: 2018 models or later\n\nBy limiting compatibility to devices powered by the A12 chip or newer, Apple ensures that iPadOS 19 can fully use the hardware capabilities of these models. This strategy not only enhances the performance of the new features but also aligns with Apple’s broader goal of balancing innovation with reliability.\n\niOS 19: Evolving Device Support\n\nThe release of iOS 19 has sparked considerable speculation about which iPhone models will remain supported. While some reports suggest that all devices running iOS 18 will transition to iOS 19, others indicate that older models such as the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max may lose support. If the latter scenario proves accurate, these devices—introduced in 2018—would no longer receive updates after seven years of software support.\n\nFor users of newer devices, iOS 19 is expected to deliver a range of enhancements designed to take full advantage of modern hardware. However, for owners of older models, the potential loss of support underscores the challenges of balancing hardware longevity with the demands of increasingly sophisticated software.\n\nLikely supported devices: iPhone 11 and newer models\n\nIf the iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max are excluded, it would mark a significant shift in Apple’s approach to device support. While these models have been celebrated for their durability and performance, the growing complexity of software features may necessitate this change, making sure that iOS 19 operates efficiently on supported devices.\n\nApple’s Strategy: Longevity Meets Innovation\n\nApple’s decisions regarding device compatibility reflect its ongoing effort to balance hardware longevity with the demands of new software advancements. By focusing on devices with the A12 chip or newer, Apple ensures that iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 deliver innovative functionality without compromising the user experience. This approach highlights Apple’s commitment to supporting devices for as long as possible, even as technological advancements push the limits of older hardware.\n\nFor iPad users, the potential for Mac-like functionality in iPadOS 19 could significantly enhance the device’s versatility, making it an even more powerful tool for both professional and casual use. For iPhone users, the transition to iOS 19 may signal the end of support for some older models, but it also promises a range of improvements that use the capabilities of newer hardware.\n\nLooking Ahead to WWDC 2025\n\nAs the June 2025 WWDC event approaches, more details about iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 are expected to emerge. The final list of compatible devices will likely be confirmed closer to the release date, but current reports provide valuable insights into Apple’s priorities. Whether you’re an iPad user eager to explore new productivity tools or an iPhone owner curious about the future of your device, these updates promise to shape the next chapter of Apple’s ecosystem.\n\nStay tuned for further announcements as Apple prepares to redefine the user experience with iOS 19 and iPadOS 19.\n\nUncover more insights about iOS 19 in previous articles we have written.\n\nSource & Image Credit: iDeviceHelp\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

Rating: About this rating Mostly True\n\nPhotographs purporting to authentically depict stock traders' reactions to the historic Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash known as \"Black Monday\" circulated online in April 2025.\n\nBlack Monday was a catastrophic financial event that, according to news coverage at the time, many people feared would result in another Great Depression.\n\nThe alleged Black Monday photographs surfaced amid discourse about the April 2, 2025, stock market crash that resulted from global concern over U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of expansive global tariffs, most of which the president later paused.\n\nOne internet user shared the photos in a popular gallery on Reddit. Some of the photos also made their way to Instagram (archived) and Facebook (archived).\n\nAll five photographs shared in the Reddit thread were authentic, and none showed evidence of any digital manipulation or use of artificial intelligence.\n\nFour of the five photographs show scenes at the New York Stock Exchange and are the work of photographer Maria Bastone according to Getty Images, a major supplier of editorial photographs to media outlets.\n\nThe captions for two of the photographs read, \"A trader (c) on the New York Stock Exchange looks at stock rates 19 October 1987 as stocks were devastated during one of the most frantic days in the exchange's history. The Dow Jones index plummeted over 200 points in record trading.\"\n\nHowever, one of the photographs on Getty has a date of Oct. 16, 1987 — the Friday before the stock market crash that would become known as Black Monday. That Friday saw what was, at the time, \"the largest one-day drop in the history of the DJIA,\" according to Federal Reserve History, and is considered one of the early indicators of what was to come the following week.\n\nBecause one of these photos was from a different date, it is not technically correct to say all of the photos in the claim authentically depict Black Monday. For this reason we've determined this claim to be mostly true.\n\n(The New York Daily News, Oct. 20, 1987)\n\nThe fifth photograph shared in the Reddit post, credited to photographer Tim Clark, can be found on The Canadian Press' image database. Unlike the other four, it does not depict the NYSE, but the Toronto Stock Exchange. The photo's caption reads, \"An exhausted trader slumps in his chair at the Toronto Stock Exchange October 19, 1987, known as Black Monday.\"\n\nReverse-image searches on Google Images and TinEye returned multiple instances of these photographs in publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The Globe and Mail, NPR, The Denver Post, Yahoo Finance and Financial Post.\n\nAn article in the New York Daily News from Oct. 20, 1987, described the previous day's events:\n\nThe market free-fall easily eclipsed the crash of Black Tuesday, 1929. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 508 points, more than four times the \"old\" record of 108.35 set Friday. The blue-chip stocks that make up the Dow lost 22.62$ of their value, easily topping the 12.82% decline of Oct. 28, 1929.\n\nAs a result of Black Monday, stock exchange organizations implemented new restrictions on the markets. These trading curbs, also called circuit breakers, are meant to automatically halt trading for a period of time should an unexpected massive drop occur.\n\nThese fail-safes were implemented during the stock market crash in March 2020 that stemmed from fears of the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic."}

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in VEEM's (ASX:VEE) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for VEEM, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.085 = AU$6.4m ÷ (AU$94m - AU$19m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nTherefore, VEEM has an ROCE of 8.5%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Machinery industry average of 11%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for VEEM\n\nASX:VEE Return on Capital Employed April 20th 2025\n\nIn the above chart we have measured VEEM's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering VEEM for free.\n\nSo How Is VEEM's ROCE Trending?\n\nWhile in absolute terms it isn't a high ROCE, it's promising to see that it has been moving in the right direction. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 8.5%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 43% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at VEEM thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that VEEM is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has returned a staggering 111% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\n\nIf you want to continue researching VEEM, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered."}

ReadCloud Limited provides eLearning software and industry-based training solutions to schools and educational institutions in Australia. On 30 September 2024, the AU$15m market-cap company posted a loss of AU$1.0m for its most recent financial year. The most pressing concern for investors is ReadCloud's path to profitability – when will it breakeven? In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable.\n\nReadCloud is bordering on breakeven, according to some Australian Software analysts. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2025, before turning a profit of AU$700k in 2026. So, the company is predicted to breakeven just over a year from now. How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2026? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 98% year-on-year, on average, which is extremely buoyant. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.\n\nASX:RCL Earnings Per Share Growth April 20th 2025\n\nGiven this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of ReadCloud's upcoming projects, but, keep in mind that generally a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.\n\nView our latest analysis for ReadCloud\n\nOne thing we’d like to point out is that ReadCloud has no debt on its balance sheet, which is rare for a loss-making growth company, which typically has high debt relative to its equity. The company currently operates purely off its shareholder funding and has no debt obligation, reducing concerns around repayments and making it a less risky investment.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nThis article is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis on ReadCloud, so if you are interested in understanding the company at a deeper level, take a look at ReadCloud's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also compiled a list of relevant aspects you should look at:\n\nValuation: What is ReadCloud worth today?

(SGX:BS6) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 13th of May to CN¥0.12. This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 5.6%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nYangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings)'s Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. However, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings)'s earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.\n\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 44.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 5.2%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.\n\nSGX:BS6 Historic Dividend April 20th 2025\n\nView our latest analysis for Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings)\n\nYangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from CN¥0.223 total annually to CN¥0.647. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) has impressed us by growing EPS at 16% per year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.\n\nYangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.

Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 47% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.\n\nOne more thing, we've spotted 2 warning signs facing UMS Holdings Berhad that you might find interesting.\n\nWhile UMS Holdings Berhad may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

This means the annual payment is 6.3% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.\n\nOur free stock report includes 3 warning signs investors should be aware of before investing in PWO. Read for free now.\n\nPWO's Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings\n\nWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, PWO's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 43.8% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 31% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\n\nXTRA:PWO Historic Dividend April 20th 2025\n\nView our latest analysis for PWO\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was €1.45, compared to the most recent full-year payment of €1.75. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 1.9% per annum over that time. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.\n\nThe Dividend Has Growth Potential\n\nGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. PWO has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.7% per year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.\n\nOur Thoughts On PWO's Dividend\n\nOverall, we think PWO is a solid choice as a dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't raised this year. The payout ratio looks good, but unfortunately the company's dividend track record isn't stellar. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for PWO (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing.

(NASDAQ:AVPT) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. AvePoint, Inc. provides cloud-native data management software platform in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. On 31 December 2024, the US$2.9b market-cap company posted a loss of US$29m for its most recent financial year. As path to profitability is the topic on AvePoint's investors mind, we've decided to gauge market sentiment. We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nConsensus from 7 of the American Software analysts is that AvePoint is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2024, before turning a profit of US$4.6m in 2025. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly 12 months from now or less. How fast will the company have to grow to reach the consensus forecasts that anticipate breakeven by 2025? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 96% year-on-year, on average, which signals high confidence from analysts. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.\n\nNasdaqGS:AVPT Earnings Per Share Growth April 20th 2025\n\nWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for AvePoint given that this is a high-level summary, however, keep in mind that generally a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for AvePoint\n\nBefore we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. AvePoint currently has no debt on its balance sheet, which is rare for a loss-making growth company, which usually has a high level of debt relative to its equity. The company currently operates purely off its shareholder funding and has no debt obligation, reducing concerns around repayments and making it a less risky investment.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nThere are key fundamentals of AvePoint which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview. For a more comprehensive look at AvePoint, take a look at AvePoint's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also put together a list of important factors you should further examine:\n\nValuation: What is AvePoint worth today?

And while there’s nothing wrong with that sort of entertainment, anime music can also be enjoyed in more elegant ways, and it’s a safe bet than none are more elegant than when the music s being performed by Jo Hisaishi and the U.K.’s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nThe legendary composer, best known for Studio Ghibli’s most memorable theatrical soundtracks, has been traveling the world with the British musicians for the Studio Ghibli Film Concert Tour. Following performances at Wembley Arena and Madison Square Garden, the tour is coming to Tokyo for its final stop, with the finale to take place at Tokyo Dome this summer.\n\n▼ Jo Hisaishi as he’s most commonly seen: dapperly dressed and concentrated on conducting\n\nThe performance combines Hisaishi’s emotional compositions with projected images from the Ghibli anime in which the music originates. For the Tokyo Dome finale, which is actually taking place over two days, the schedule includes pieces from Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Castle in the Sky/Laputa, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Porco Rosso, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, Ponyo, and The Wind Rises.

He also said that those who lie to the public “have to be held responsible.”\n\nTrump sent out an Easter message early on Sunday, and in the afternoon kicked things off with several ALL-CAPS posts on different topics, including tariffs.\n\nAfter that half-hour or so starter, Trump shared multiple articles and re-shared posts from others, before ultimately going in on Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident and El Salvador native who has been at the center of a firestorm and has even had podcast host Joe Rogan questioning the administration’s actions.\n\n“Radical Lunatic Democrats and their Comrades in the Fake News Media are falsely making Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia out to be a very sweet and innocent person, which is a total, blatant, and dangerous LIE,” Trump wrote. “Garcia has been found by two separate Courts to be a member of the violent, killer gang MS-13, was in our Country illegally, and is under a Deportation Order.”\n\n“It is despicable and unAmerican for Liberals and the Mainstream Media to hate our Country so much, and be obsessed with protecting criminals, instead of working to keep our Border, streets, and families safe,” Trump said. “Those lying to the American People on behalf of violent criminals have to be held responsible by the Agencies and the Courts.”\n\nThe administration has repeatedly accused Abrego Garcia of being affiliated with violent street gang MS-13, and critics have pressed the administration over the lack of due process of law and for deporting him despite a previous immigration court suspending his removal."}

Pearl brand drums and rock-paper-scissors are but a few, and now I’m going to have to add the game Pop-up Pirate to that list.\n\nThis is the game where you have a plastic pirate hiding in a plastic barrel and each player sticks plastic swords into the slots on the side of the barrel. If a sword goes into a certain spot it causes the pirate to pop out and that player to lose the game. It was originally created by Japanese toy giant Takara Tomy under the name Kurohige Kiki Ippatsu (literally, “Blackbeard’s One-shot Crisis”) in 1975. Because it required no speaking or reading, the universal appeal of the game made it a hit in 47 countries around the world, regrettably but wisely under the name of “Pop-up Pirate” rather than a literal translation of the Japanese title.\n\nNow in its 50th year, over 20 million games have been sold, and if we assume each one was played at least once that little pirate’s 10-centimeter take-off would amount to 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles), or enough for five trips to the International Space Station.\n\n▼ “Ken-chan! Look at the pirate, not the cam… Oh, well.”\n\nIn honor of this, Takara Tomy will release the seventh edition of Pop-up Pirate and will revert it to the original rules set in 1975. As surprising as it may sound, this simple game has undergone a few rule changes throughout its history. When the game was originally designed 50 years ago, the concept was that all the players were pirates trying to free their boss, Blackbeard, who was trapped inside the barrel. This meant, that whoever made him pop out was the one who saved him and thus won the game.\n\n▼ The original Kurohige Kiki Ippatsu design from 1975\n\nIn 1979, that rule was loosened so that popping out Blackbeard would cause the player to either win or lose the game, as long as it was clearly defined prior to playing. However, around the ’80s there was a television game show in which players lost points or prizes either for making the pirate appear or failing to catch him when he did appear. This strengthened the association of bringing out Blackbeard with losing such that in 1995 it became the game’s official rule.\n\nBut with this newest edition of Pop-up Pirate, the official rule will once again be that making Blackbeard emerge is a victory. This is because Takara Tomy wants the game to be about the joy of winning rather than the fear of losing.\n\n▼ The 2025 Edition of Pop-up Pirate\n\nThe new version will come with a booklet that gives the history of the game and some related trivia. It also will have a redesigned pirate, which is actually more in line with the overseas version of the pirate and probably won’t look redesigned at all outside of Japan.\n\n▼ Left: The old Japanese Blackbeard, Right: The new Japanese Blackbeard\n\nAlso in honor of Blackbeard’s 50 years of crises, a series of Line messaging app stamps have been released to communicate those complex emotions that can only be expressed in Pop-up Pirate terms.\n\n▼ “I’ll fly over!”\n\nSo, whether it’s buying the new Pop-up Pirate when it hits Japanese stores and e-commerce sites on 5 July, downloading some pirate stamps, or just dusting off your old game and hoping you haven’t lost too many swords, be sure to take a moment to honor this long-running game for its half a century in existence.\n\nSource, images: PR Wire\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio.\n\nInvestors in Dogecoin were sent mixed signals this week after market analysts disclosed forecasts regarding the future price action of the meme cryptocurrency. Some predict a spectacular rally, while others forecast a sharp decline before there can be any rally.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAnalyst Predicts 500% Price Jump Based On Chart Pattern\n\nFrom crypto commentator “Steph is Crypto,” Dogecoin looks primed for an epic price surge in excess of 500%. That’s the estimate based on a chart pattern seen before a preceding market cycle during which Dogecoin surged 501% after trending down in the last few weeks.\n\n“Bottom signal flashing,” Steph tweeted on social media site X, implying that the same pattern is developing again following another 129-day downtrend. If this trend holds, Dogecoin will rise as much as $0.73583 within the next few weeks.\n\nThe Drop Before Reversal\n\nNot everyone agrees with this optimistic view, though. An alternative prediction from SwallowAcademy on TradingView is that Dogecoin may first see a dramatic fall before it can go up. Their study of the price action of Dogecoin relative to Tether (USDT) indicates a possible 40% drop to the $0.09 support level.\n\nSwallowAcademy’s analysis observes that following a brush with close to $0.23 earlier this year, Dogecoin dropped to $0.09 before rising above $0.45.\n\nThe analyst foresees the same trend happening, with a sharp drop followed by a four times jump that might ultimately retest the $0.45 level. When this report was made, Dogecoin was trading above $0.15.\n\nShort-Term Trader Numbers Spike\n\nMarket intelligence company IntoTheBlock’s data shows dramatic shifts in the behavior of Dogecoin holders. Long-term holders who owned the cryptocurrency for more than a year fell by 2.67% last month. Medium-term holders (one to 12 months) fell by nearly 12%.\n\nMeanwhile, short-term traders with holding time of less than one month rose by over 100%. This radical movement toward short-term speculation might signify greater price volatility since these traders will respond rapidly to changes in the market.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nShiba Inu Sees $120 Million Weekly Surge—Whales Tighten Their Grip 1 month ago\n\nLarge Investor Activity Shows Massive Increase\n\nPerhaps the most dramatic statistics come from monitoring large holder transactions. Large holder inflows increased by over 5% in the last week, as reported by IntoTheBlock. On a longer term basis, these inflows were up 324% in the last 30 days.\n\nThis increase in whale activity indicates significant investors may be setting themselves up for future price action even though daily trading continues to be dominated by smaller, short-term traders.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"}

Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio.\n\nNew blockchain information shows that large investors remain in control of the Shiba Inu crypto market, potentially creating both stability and risk for smaller traders. The meme coin has experienced regular trading activity throughout while exhibiting zero price actions over recent days.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nMajor Holders Hodl Most Of SHIB Tokens\n\nAccording to blockchain tracking site IntoTheBlock, around 74% of Shiba Inu’s 95 billion circulating tokens are in whale-like large addresses. The concentration is high and puts the token’s ecosystem into the hands of few wealth investors.\n\nConcentration among large holders sends contradictory signals to the market: some analysts interpret it as a confidence vote for SHIB’s future, while others see it as a double-edged sword that creates an unstable environment wherein the big players would set off cataclysmic price fluctuations should they wish to liquidate their assets.\n\nWeekly Transaction Volume Exceeds $120 Million\n\nIn the same tracking metrics, there have been large trades covering over $120 million with respect to SHIB within the last week (each trade being above $100,000). This substantial trading volume comes despite minimal price action, with the meme crypto having a current price tag of $0.00001226 and showing less than 1% daily change.\n\nThe volume of transactions provides a glimpse into institutional and whale-scale activity on the platform, a market analyst disclosed. The ongoing high-value transactions indicate sustained interest among large investors, despite the price staying flat.\n\nRetail Traders Confronted With Reassurance And Risk\n\nThe large holding of SHIB tokens by rich investors is a mixed picture for small investors. On the positive side, the investment from such huge investors could assuage retail investors regarding the token’s stability and long-term worth.\n\nBut this configuration also creates substantial risk. Any abrupt change of position by these large holders can bring on rapid and steep price action. Market watchers point out that when the ownership is so concentrated, even normal portfolio rebalancing by a handful of large holders can make a huge market disturbance.\n\nCrypto Market Watches Whale Behavior For Price Signals\n\nSince whale activity usually precedes significant market action, it is closely monitored by the crypto community. With over 70% of the SHIB supply in the hands of moneyed investors and $120 million in recent high transactions, many are keeping tabs for reversals in sentiment from such powerful hands.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nWhales Swallowing Bitcoin Fast — Will This Push BTC Price Up? 1 month ago\n\nThe current context of SHIB truly depicts a classic case of where a few well-to-do investors can significantly impact price action in cryptocurrency markets. In these circumstances, the very high transaction volumes reflect true interest among institutional investors, while the extreme concentration of holdings must certainly remain a foremost consideration in the assessment of any market dynamics concerning SHIB.\n\nFeatured image from Gemini Imagen, chart from TradingView"}

Recent statistics indicate that these large holders, or “whales,” are acquiring around three times the amount of daily Bitcoin produced by miners as the cryptocurrency sits at key price levels.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight—Report 1 month ago\n\nWhales Purchase At Record Levels While Exchanges Witness Outflows\n\nAccording to Glassnode information, investors possessing between 100 and 1,000 Bitcoins are buying up the cryptocurrency aggressively. These giant holders are at present taking on over 300% of the annual supply emission of Bitcoin.\n\nMeanwhile, large crypto exchanges are seeing steady outflows of Bitcoin. This indicates that increasing numbers of whales and large holders are taking their assets to long-term storage instead of leaving them on hand for trading. Market observers view this exodus from exchanges as a sign of improving confidence in the long-term worth of Bitcoin.\n\nMost of these large investors have persisted in buying when prices drop, viewing downturns as opportunities to increase their positions rather than sell. Onchain analysts have reported that this activity is reminiscent of trends during Bitcoin’s 2020 bull cycle.\n\nTechnical Indicators Reflect Key Resistance Points\n\nBitcoin is now testing its 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages as points of resistance. Based on previous examination by analysts, these levels are approximately $85,500.\n\nA pullback could occur if Bitcoin does not manage to breach the technical barriers. The next important support lies at about $80,000 on the upper trendline of the current wedge formation.\n\nA narrow price range has existed for some time, between about $75,000 and $85,000.

The price has seen a drop of nearly 30% since then.\n\nAccording to analysts, this drop follows the typical trend of previous bull markets. A decrease of 25-35% occurring midway through the cycle would usually denote a situation from which the prices would then continue up once again.\n\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"}

His assertions have both interested and confused investors.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBNB Weathers The Storm Better Than Altcoins, Stats Show 1 month ago\n\nInvestor Forecasts 50-Fold Return On XRP\n\nAs per the Alpha Lions Academy founder Edoardo Farina, an investment of $1,000 in XRP today can increase to more than $50,000 in the future. The estimate is based on the altcoin crossing Farina’s desired price target of $100 per token, from its current value of around $2.\n\n“Buying $1,000 worth right now is really buying over $50,000 in the future when $XRP hits $100+”, Farina tweeted recently.\n\nFarina previously revealed he will not sell any of his XRP holdings until the price reaches at least $100 per token. He terms the coin as sitting at the hub of what he refers to as a “multi-generational pump” and points out its potential function within the international finance system.\n\nXRP @ $2 Buying $1,000 worth right now is really buying over $50,000 in the future when $XRP hits $100+ 50x return — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 18, 2025\n\nMinimum Holdings Suggestion Sparks Skepticism\n\nAccording to reports, Farina urges retail investors to own a minimum of 1,000 XRP tokens. He asserts that such an amount is the minimum one needs in order to take advantage of the use and greater adoption of XRP in the future.\n\nSuch opinions regarding the issue have been unequivocal. Farina has reportedly said that individuals who have fewer than 1,000 XRP tokens “don’t care enough about their financial success” and called possessing less than that amount “insanity.”\n\nThough these comments represent Farina’s individual investment strategy, they echo a developing perception among XRP enthusiasts that the asset is undervalued and poised for strong growth if regulatory clarity increases and more businesses embrace it.\n\nDoubters Challenge The Life-Changing Assertions\n\nNot everyone shares Farina’s positive perspective. Doubters have raised issues with his assertion that $1,000 in XRP today may be worth $50,000 someday.\n\nOne critic pointed out that even if XRP hits $100 and converts $1,000 into $50,000, this may not be sufficient for early retirement. The remark points out that what appears to be a good return may not necessarily be the life-altering wealth many investors expect.\n\nQuestions also arise regarding if XRP will ever hit the $100 level, and if so, how long it would take to arrive there.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nWhales Swallowing Bitcoin Fast — Will This Push BTC Price Up? 1 month ago\n\nPrice Target Timeline Indicates Long Way To Go\n\nThe journey to $100 looks long for XRP, which is currently trading at about $2.

Taylor, argue the Montgomery County Board of Education is infringing on their free exercise rights under the First Amendment.\n\n“New government-imposed orthodoxy about what children are ‘supposed’ to think about gender and sexuality is not a constitutional basis to sideline a child’s own parents,” the parents, backed by The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, wrote in their petition.\n\nBooks elementary school teachers read to students include “Pride Puppy,” which asks students to look for images of items like “underwear” and the name of a “controversial LGBTQ activist and sex worker,” and “Intersection Allies,” which asks students to consider questions like what it means to be transgender, according to court documents.\n\nWhile the school board initially allowed parents with religious objections to opt their children out of the program, it later changed its decision and declined to even offer parental notice.\n\nOpt-outs are available for sex ed classes mandated in high school, yet the district denies opt-outs for the “LGBTQ-inclusive” storybooks it required for elementary students in just 2022, according to parents’ petition. The parents sued in May 2023.\n\n“Our nation has a long tradition of respecting parents’ right to decide when and how to introduce their children to such sensitive topics, and we are confident the Court will uphold that enduring freedom here,” Eric Baxter, vice president and senior counsel at Becket, said in a statement.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found 2-1 last year that the parents’ free exercise rights were not burdened because the school board had not compelled them to “change their religious beliefs or conduct.”\n\n“[S]imply hearing about other views does not necessarily exert pressure to believe or act differently than one’s religious faith requires,” the court held.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to take up the case in January. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Blue State Schools Facing Trump Admin Investigation Helped Hundreds Of Kids Change Their Gender Last Year)\n\nThe district argues that there is “no evidence that any parent or child was penalized for his or her religious beliefs, asked to affirm any views contrary to his or her faith, or otherwise prohibited or deterred from engaging in religious practice.”\n\nThe Trump administration, in a brief backing the parents, wrote that the lower court “overlooks that the relevant religious practices are parents’ sincere beliefs.”\n\n“The Board’s policy requires parents to ‘shed their religious beliefs,’ about how to raise their children within their faiths: They cannot subject their children to the schools’ instruction regarding the storybooks without violating those beliefs,” they wrote.\n\nMahmoud v. Taylor is one of several religious liberty cases at the Supreme Court this term. In March, the justices heard a case brought by Catholic Charities, which challenged Wisconsin’s decision to deny it an unemployment tax exemption for religious organizations.\n\nThe justices will also consider a challenge to the country’s first religious charter school — which the Oklahoma Supreme Court found violates the First Amendment’s establishment clause — on April 30.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump’s tariffs, which have now risen to a whopping total of 245% for some goods, aim to cripple China by cutting access to its largest export partner and cut off the nation from other trading partners, sources told the Wall Street Journal Tuesday.\n\n“This is the first time that anyone of any consequence has stood up and said, ‘no more,'” Stephen Yates, senior research Fellow for China and National Security Policy at the Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “We are going to renegotiate the terms of our engagement in a way that is more fair to my country’s interests, and there are some priorities that you’re going to have to address.” (RELATED: Trump Weighs Tariffs As Tool To Break China’s Stranglehold On ‘Critical Minerals’)\n\nVietnam accounts for nearly 4% of all exports from China in 2023, totaling $135 billion worth in goods, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) data. Vietnam signed a trade deal with China during Xi Jinping’s visit Monday, further strengthening the two communist country’s ties.\n\nVietnam is also a large U.S. trade partner, exporting over $136 billion of goods to the states in 2024, according to U.S. Census data.\n\nMalaysia netted around 1.91% of all Chinese exports with a value of $65.5 billion in 2023. Xi Jinping stressed cooperation between the two nations Wednesday, with Malaysia also supplying the CCP with nearly 66% of its crude oil exports in 2023.\n\n“Beijing believes it has advantages in its neighboring region and Trump’s volatile policy is harming America’s credibility and soft power in Asia,” Zhao Minghao, professor of international studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the WSJ.\n\nChina has also shown an interest in partnering with Europe amid Trump’s tariffs, with Beijing being the second largest trading partner with the EU behind the U.S. Recently, The EU considered dropping tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, instead setting minimum prices on the products.\n\nChina’s economy was already in a precarious position before the onset of the trade war, in part due to an ongoing struggle to fix a dismal real estate market and a rapidly aging population. Moreover, China is struggling to find buyers for its large sums of cheap goods it once sent to the U.S. en masse.\n\nTrump signed an executive order Wednesday directing Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick to investigate the possibility and feasibility of new tariffs on “critical minerals,” which include cobalt, lithium, nickel and others frequently used to produce advanced goods.\n\n“China seems to think it can survive without the United States making substantial investments in China,” Yates told the DCNF. “It doesn’t seem to believe that after tariffs, COVID, fentanyl and other activities, America and others just might be serious about re-balancing our supply chains. So they seem to be not in a panic, but somewhat arrogant, if you ask me.”\n\nThe Department of Commerce did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Oriental Interest Berhad's ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nWe've discovered 2 warning signs about Oriental Interest Berhad. View them for free.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Oriental Interest Berhad is:\n\n11% = RM102m ÷ RM940m (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every MYR1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn MYR0.11 in profit.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Oriental Interest Berhad\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nOriental Interest Berhad's Earnings Growth And 11% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Oriental Interest Berhad's ROE doesn't look very promising. However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 5.1%, is definitely interesting. This certainly adds some context to Oriental Interest Berhad's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years. That being said, the company does have a slightly low ROE to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average. Hence there might be some other aspects that are causing earnings to grow. Such as- high earnings retention or the company belonging to a high growth industry.\n\nNext, on comparing Oriental Interest Berhad's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 16% over the last few years."}

Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nPrivate companies, on the other hand, account for 32% of the company's stockholders.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sing Investments & Finance.\n\nView our latest analysis for Sing Investments & Finance\n\nSGX:S35 Ownership Breakdown April 20th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Lack Of Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sing Investments & Finance?\n\nInstitutional investors often avoid companies that are too small, too illiquid or too risky for their tastes. But it's unusual to see larger companies without any institutional investors.\n\nThere are many reasons why a company might not have any institutions on the share registry. It may be hard for institutions to buy large amounts of shares, if liquidity (the amount of shares traded each day) is low. If the company has not needed to raise capital, institutions might lack the opportunity to build a position. Alternatively, there might be something about the company that has kept institutional investors away. Sing Investments & Finance might not have the sort of past performance institutions are looking for, or perhaps they simply have not studied the business closely.\n\nSGX:S35 Earnings and Revenue Growth April 20th 2025\n\nHedge funds don't have many shares in Sing Investments & Finance. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is F. H. Lee Holdings (Pte) Limited with 28% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 2.6% and 1.9% of the stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Sze Leong Lee directly holds 0.8% of the total shares outstanding.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 19 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. We're not picking up on any analyst coverage of the stock at the moment, so the company is unlikely to be widely held."}

Despite a low return on equity at 16.1%, its price-to-earnings ratio of 4.8x indicates potential undervaluation compared to the broader Australian market average of 17.1x. However, concerns about dividend sustainability exist as current payouts are not well covered by free cash flows, and management's relatively short tenure may impact strategic continuity.\n\nOverview: Hearts and Minds Investments (ASX:HM1) is an Australian-listed investment company with a market cap of A$618.25 million, focusing on generating long-term capital growth by investing in high-conviction ideas from leading fund managers.\n\nThe Australian stock market has shown resilience, climbing back above the 7,800 points level despite mixed signals from global markets.

Short-term assets exceed liabilities, ensuring liquidity stability; however, profit margins have declined to 1.4% from 3.1%.

But the long term shareholders of OFX Group Limited (ASX:OFX) have had an unfortunate run in the last three years. Sadly for them, the share price is down 58% in that time. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 28% in the last year. Furthermore, it's down 22% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.\n\nNow let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nWe check all companies for important risks. See what we found for OFX Group in our free report.\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nAlthough the share price is down over three years, OFX Group actually managed to grow EPS by 11% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.\n\nSince the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.\n\nWe note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 17% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. It's probably worth investigating OFX Group further; while we may be missing something on this analysis, there might also be an opportunity.\n\nYou can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nASX:OFX Earnings and Revenue Growth April 20th 2025\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWhile the broader market gained around 5.8% in the last year, OFX Group shareholders lost 28%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 2% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be two business days before the record date, which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade can take two business days or more to settle. This means that investors who purchase Crescendo Corporation Berhad's shares on or after the 24th of April will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of May.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be RM00.04 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of RM0.07 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Crescendo Corporation Berhad has a trailing yield of approximately 8.4% on its current stock price of RM01.19. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nOur free stock report includes 1 warning sign investors should be aware of before investing in Crescendo Corporation Berhad. Read for free now.\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Crescendo Corporation Berhad is paying out just 3.1% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. The good news is it paid out just 7.2% of its free cash flow in the last year.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Crescendo Corporation Berhad\n\nClick here to see how much of its profit Crescendo Corporation Berhad paid out over the last 12 months.\n\nKLSE:CRESNDO Historic Dividend April 20th 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Crescendo Corporation Berhad's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 83% per annum for the past five years. With earnings per share growing rapidly and the company sensibly reinvesting almost all of its profits within the business, Crescendo Corporation Berhad looks like a promising growth company."}

(NYSE:IBP) might not have the largest market cap around , it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$206 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$156. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Installed Building Products' current trading price of US$158 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Installed Building Products’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nWe've discovered 1 warning sign about Installed Building Products. View them for free.\n\nIs Installed Building Products Still Cheap?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 16% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Installed Building Products today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $188.53, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Installed Building Products’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Installed Building Products\n\nWhat does the future of Installed Building Products look like?\n\nNYSE:IBP Earnings and Revenue Growth April 20th 2025\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 8.1% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Installed Building Products, at least in the short term.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? IBP’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?"}

These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nCantex Mine Development Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman of the Board Charles Fipke bought CA$1m worth of shares at a price of CA$0.12 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (CA$0.18), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.\n\nCantex Mine Development insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any.

So it is hard to draw any conclusion about how insiders are feeling about the stock, from these recent trades.\n\nDoes Cantex Mine Development Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Cantex Mine Development insiders own about CA$7.2m worth of shares. That equates to 30% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders."}

So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that TMC the metals does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see TMC the metals' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNasdaqGS:TMC Earnings and Revenue Growth April 20th 2025\n\nTMC the metals is not owned by hedge funds.

Additionally, the company's CEO Gerard Barron directly holds 5.2% of the total shares outstanding.\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 15 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."}

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on XRF Scientific's ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nWe've discovered 1 warning sign about XRF Scientific. View them for free.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for XRF Scientific is:\n\n18% = AU$9.8m ÷ AU$54m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.18.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for XRF Scientific\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nXRF Scientific's Earnings Growth And 18% ROE\n\nAt first glance, XRF Scientific seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 8.7%. Probably as a result of this, XRF Scientific was able to see an impressive net income growth of 23% over the last five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nAs a next step, we compared XRF Scientific's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 19% in the same period.\n\nASX:XRF Past Earnings Growth April 20th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if XRF Scientific is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry."}

That is, insiders acquired the stock in greater numbers than they sold it.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nWe've discovered 2 warning signs about 4Sight Holdings. View them for free.\n\n4Sight Holdings Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by CFO, Financial Director & Executive Director Eric van Merwe for R8.5m worth of shares, at about R0.71 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of R0.70. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Eric van Merwe. We note that Eric van Merwe was both the biggest buyer and the biggest seller.\n\nEric van Merwe bought a total of 15.33m shares over the year at an average price of R0.61. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for 4Sight Holdings\n\nJSE:4SI Insider Trading Volume April 20th 2025\n\nThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. If investing in lesser known companies is your style, you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nAre 4Sight Holdings Insiders Buying Or Selling?\n\nIn the last three months company insider Marie-Louise Zitzke divested R1.8k worth of stock. That is not a lot. Ultimately the overall selling isn't enough to tell us much.\n\nInsider Ownership Of 4Sight Holdings\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. 4Sight Holdings insiders own about R218m worth of shares (which is 58% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About 4Sight Holdings Insiders?\n\nWhile there has not been any insider buying in the last three months, there has been selling. But given the selling was modest, we're not worried. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like 4Sight Holdings insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing 4Sight Holdings. For example - 4Sight Holdings has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of."}

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Hume Cement Industries Berhad's (KLSE:HUMEIND) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Hume Cement Industries Berhad:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.31 = RM311m ÷ (RM1.3b - RM259m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nSo, Hume Cement Industries Berhad has an ROCE of 31%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Basic Materials industry average of 7.0%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Hume Cement Industries Berhad\n\nKLSE:HUMEIND Return on Capital Employed April 20th 2025\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Hume Cement Industries Berhad's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Hume Cement Industries Berhad for free.\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Hume Cement Industries Berhad's ROCE Trend?\n\nWe're delighted to see that Hume Cement Industries Berhad is reaping rewards from its investments and is now generating some pre-tax profits. About five years ago the company was generating losses but things have turned around because it's now earning 31% on its capital. And unsurprisingly, like most companies trying to break into the black, Hume Cement Industries Berhad is utilizing 57% more capital than it was five years ago. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, both common traits of a multi-bagger.\n\nOne more thing to note, Hume Cement Industries Berhad has decreased current liabilities to 20% of total assets over this period, which effectively reduces the amount of funding from suppliers or short-term creditors. Therefore we can rest assured that the growth in ROCE is a result of the business' fundamental improvements, rather than a cooking class featuring this company's books."}

[Review]", "fullContent": "Star Wars Day (May the 4th) is always a fun day for LEGO Star Wars fans. As well as the usual festivities, it often coincides with the launch of several new sets in the theme – and a new Gift with Purchase (GWP). This year, we’re visiting the cloners on Kamino with 40765 Kamino Training Facility. With 190 pieces, you’ll need to spend US $160 | CAN $210 | UK £145 on Star Wars products between May 1st and May 5th to get it added to your shopping cart. Luckily there are loads of ways to do that with new sets: helmets from the prequels and sequels, the galaxy’s most violent astromech droid, or to get it all in one go, the UCS Slave I. If you’re on the fence about getting it, read our review to see if it will sway your opinion!\n\nThe LEGO Group provided The Brothers Brick with an early copy of this set for review. Providing TBB with products for review guarantees neither coverage nor positive reviews.\n\nThe box and contents\n\nThe box is pretty small, and is more akin to mainline Star Wars sets than anything with the black 18+ backgrounds.\n\nOn the back we can see the cadets recovering from the training session they just had on the front of the box.\n\nThen it’s punch, punch and we find two plastic bags and an instruction booklet within. We can already get a good idea of how the build will be split up based on the colour palette of each one!\n\nThe build\n\nAnd sure enough, we start with the two bits of training facility furniture. One is a turret, the other a small barricade with weapons storage. They’re decked out in the black-and-white of the training facility, as seen in the Clone Wars and Bad Batch animated series.\n\nThe rest of our parts go towards the KE-8 Enforcer – a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it ship that appeared on Kamino in Attack of the Clones. The parts of it that we have in bag one make up its core, with SNOT bricks and brackets aplenty.\n\nHere’s how it looks before we tackle bag 2…\n\n… at which point we add on some external detailing. There’s a big turntable on either side, to which will be attached the ship’s thruster pods later.\n\nFor now, though, it’s a question of building the rest of the cockpit. There’s a neat stud inversion at the bottom using clips and bars. Those quarter-domes are making only their second appearance in white, having also popped up in 77072 Peely Bone. They line up very nicely with the trans-black cockpit piece.\n\nThe spur at the bottom of the ship is next. It’s all one stud wide. The lower section includes what is presumably the “electroshock stun device” (Thanks Wookieepedia!).\n\nThen, finally, we have the thruster pods. These are probably the most intricate bit of the whole thing, although that’s not saying much. All told, it’s a very quick build – the whole set took me less than half an hour.\n\nThe minifigures\n\nWe have three brand-new minifigures in this GWP. Well, technically it’s just one, but there are three of them, so… Look, you get what I mean. Anyway, there’s a new torso print with an awesome Kamino cloners logo on the arms. The dual-moulded legs, normally seen on Santa Claus minifigures, are a nice inclusion.\n\nAside from their choice of weapon, all three are identical. They are clones, after all. We’re building up quite the repertoire of clone variants: all we need are some clone younglings and we can see the lineage all the way back to the proto-clone himself, Jango Fett!\n\nThe finished model\n\nIn some respects, this set feels a little bit like a battle pack, albeit with one minifigure traded out for a more substantial build in the Enforcer. The two obstacles definitely feel like they come from one: decent small-scale representations of what they are, but more likely to end up in the parts bin.\n\nAnd now, a confession: although I consider myself a pretty big Star Wars nerd, I had absolutely no idea what the white ship was. It took some fellow nerds to point out it was a KE-8 Enforcer. Its main appearance was in Attack of the Clones, where it was seen flying around the cloning facility on Kamino (or it was if you were paying close attention). Apparently it did feature in the Battlefront II video game as well. Here’s what it looks like if you did miss it:\n\nDespite the limited reference material, this is a pretty good representation of this obscure craft. Given they were for keeping unruly clone cadets in line, it’s likely they would have been piloted by Kaminoans, rather than cadets as depicted here. Although I didn’t get a picture, I can confirm that the Taun We figure from 75333 Obi-Wan Kenobi’s Starfighter just about fits in the cockpit, too.\n\nThe only inaccuracy – at least based on the photo above – is that the spur on the bottom seems to be a little long. At least it makes for a sturdy base when folded up. It’s tricky to take a photo of it upright: as you’d expect, it doesn’t balance particularly well on the tip of that wedge piece.\n\nConclusion and recommendation\n\nThis is a very niche setting for a LEGO set. Kamino gets plenty of screen-time in the animated series especially, but a repelled invasion aside there’s not much action. The training facility is seen far more infrequently. In a sense, that makes it perfect for a GWP: there probably isn’t enough demand to justify a full-scale release, but it’s a nice opportunity to get a clone variant that probably wouldn’t appear otherwise.\n\nBut to be honest, the clone cadet minifigures are the only real draw in this set. With the exception of the white quarter-domes, none of the other parts are especially rare, so it shouldn’t be too difficult to re-create yourself for a fraction of the buying threshold. I’d say this is one for the minifigure or clone collectors (or anyone who really loves Kamino). If that’s you, then fortunately, there is no shortage of clone-themed sets to qualify for it.\n\nLEGO Star Wars 40765 Kamino Training Facility contains 190 pieces and three minifigures, and is free with LEGO Star Wars purchases totalling US $160 | CAN $210 | UK £145 or more between May 1st and May 5th.\n\nThe LEGO Group provided The Brothers Brick with an early copy of this set for review.

Here’s How to Fix It!", "fullContent": "If your iPhone’s battery life has noticeably declined after updating to iOS 18.4.1, you’re not alone. Many users report similar issues following major system updates. The good news is that there are practical steps you can take to address this problem. The video below from iReviews provides ten effective strategies to help you conserve battery life and maintain optimal performance on your device.\n\nWhy Battery Drain Happens After Updates\n\nBattery drain after a system update like iOS 18.4.1 is often caused by background processes running to optimize your device for the new software. These processes include system recalibrations, indexing, and other adjustments that can temporarily increase power consumption. Typically, this adjustment period lasts 4–5 days. During this time, it’s important to monitor your usage and avoid activities that could further strain the battery. Understanding this process helps you take proactive steps to mitigate the impact.\n\n1. Update Your Apps\n\nOutdated apps are a common cause of battery drain, as they may not be fully optimized for the latest iOS version. Developers frequently release updates to improve compatibility, fix bugs, and enhance performance. To ensure your apps are running efficiently:\n\nOpen the App Store and update all installed apps to their latest versions.\n\nEnable automatic updates to keep your apps current without requiring manual intervention.\n\nKeeping your apps updated ensures they work seamlessly with iOS 18.4.1, reducing unnecessary battery consumption.\n\n2. Adjust Haptic Feedback Settings\n\nHaptic feedback, such as vibrations for keyboard interactions or system notifications, can subtly drain your battery over time. While these features enhance user experience, they are not essential for everyone. To conserve energy:\n\nNavigate to Settings > Sounds & Haptics .\n\n. Reduce or disable haptic feedback for non-essential features, such as keyboard vibrations.\n\nThis small adjustment can make a noticeable difference in your device’s overall battery performance.\n\n3. Optimize 5G Connectivity\n\nAlthough 5G offers faster internet speeds, it can significantly impact battery life, especially in areas with weak 5G signals. To manage this:\n\nSwitch to LTE/4G in areas with poor 5G coverage by going to Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options .\n\n. Use Wi-Fi whenever possible, as it generally consumes less power than cellular data.\n\nBy optimizing your connectivity settings, you can balance speed and battery efficiency.\n\n4. Refine Control Center Widgets\n\nWidgets in the Control Center, particularly those with live updates like weather or news, can continuously refresh in the background, consuming battery. To minimize this:\n\nLimit the number of widgets displayed in your Control Center.\n\nChoose static widgets that don’t require constant updates.\n\nSimplifying your widget setup reduces background activity and helps conserve power.\n\n5. Identify Battery-Draining Apps\n\nSome apps may use more battery than expected, even when they’re not actively in use. To identify and address these apps:\n\nGo to Settings > Battery and review the battery usage breakdown by app.\n\nand review the battery usage breakdown by app. Uninstall or limit the usage of apps that consume excessive battery power.\n\nThis step allows you to pinpoint and manage apps that are disproportionately affecting your battery life.\n\n6. Disable AirDrop When Not in Use\n\nAirDrop is a convenient feature for sharing files, but leaving it enabled unnecessarily can drain your battery. To prevent this:\n\nTurn off AirDrop by swiping down to open the Control Center and tapping the AirDrop icon.\n\nEnable it only when you need to share files.\n\nDisabling AirDrop when it’s not needed reduces background activity and conserves energy.\n\n7. Manage Background App Refresh\n\nBackground App Refresh allows apps to update their content even when not in use, which can significantly impact battery life. To optimize this feature:\n\nGo to Settings > General > Background App Refresh .\n\n. Disable it for non-essential apps or turn it off entirely.\n\nThis adjustment ensures that only critical apps refresh in the background, reducing unnecessary battery drain.\n\n8. Optimize Location Services\n\nLocation Services can be a major source of battery drain if not carefully managed. To reduce its impact:\n\nGo to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services .\n\n. Set most apps to “While Using the App” and disable location access for apps that don’t require it.\n\nTurn off precise location for apps unless absolutely necessary.\n\nFine-tuning these settings ensures that location-based features only use power when needed.\n\n9. Adjust Siri Settings\n\nSiri’s voice recognition features, such as “Hey Siri,” can consume battery even when not actively used. If you don’t rely on Siri frequently:\n\nGo to Settings > Siri & Search .\n\n. Disable “Listen for ‘Hey Siri’” and other Siri-related features.\n\nThis adjustment reduces background activity associated with Siri, helping to extend battery life.\n\n10. Monitor and Adjust Over Time\n\nBattery optimization is an ongoing process. Regularly reviewing your settings and usage patterns can help maintain your iPhone’s efficiency. Additionally:\n\nKeep an eye on new iOS updates, as Apple often releases patches to address battery-related issues.\n\nPeriodically revisit your settings to ensure they align with your current usage habits.\n\nBy staying proactive, you can ensure your iPhone remains reliable and efficient over time.\n\nCheck out more relevant guides from our extensive collection on iOS 18.4.1 Battery Optimization that you might find useful.\n\nSource & Image Credit: iReviews\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

Whether the apps originate from the Mac App Store or third-party sources, removing them properly ensures that no residual files clutter your system. The video from Daniel About Tech provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to uninstalling apps effectively, addressing common challenges such as system restrictions and apps with built-in uninstallers.\n\nStep 1: Locate Installed Applications\n\nThe first step in uninstalling apps is identifying which ones you want to remove. This process helps you prioritize and focus on applications that consume the most storage or are no longer in use. To locate installed apps:\n\nNavigate to System Settings > General > Storage on your Mac.\n\non your Mac. Review the list of installed applications, noting the storage space each app occupies.\n\nThis overview allows you to make informed decisions about which apps to delete. For instance, targeting larger or rarely used apps can have the most significant impact on freeing up storage space.\n\nStep 2: Delete Applications\n\nOnce you’ve identified the apps to remove, follow these steps to delete them:\n\nIn the Storage menu, locate the app you wish to delete.\n\nmenu, locate the app you wish to delete. Click the “i” icon next to the app’s name to access its details.\n\nicon next to the app’s name to access its details. Select the “Delete” option to initiate the uninstallation process.\n\nYou may be prompted to authenticate the action using your password or Touch ID. This security measure ensures that only authorized users can delete applications. After the app is removed, the system will display the amount of storage space that has been freed, providing immediate feedback on the effectiveness of your actions.\n\nStep 3: Handle Apps with Built-in Uninstallers\n\nCertain applications, particularly those downloaded from third-party sources, include their own uninstallers. These uninstallers are designed to remove all associated files and components. If the “Delete” option is unavailable or grayed out in the Storage menu, follow these steps:\n\nOpen the application and look for an “Uninstall” option, typically located in the app’s settings or help menu.\n\noption, typically located in the app’s settings or help menu. Follow the on-screen instructions provided by the uninstaller to ensure all components are removed.\n\nThis step is especially important for apps that install additional files, such as plugins or system extensions, outside the main application folder. Using the built-in uninstaller ensures a thorough removal process.\n\nStep 4: Understand System Restrictions\n\nSome native Apple applications, such as Safari or Mail, cannot be deleted due to system restrictions. These apps are integral to macOS and are protected to ensure system stability. Instead of a “Delete” option, these apps will display a “Show in Finder” button. While you cannot remove these apps, you can take the following actions:\n\nDisable specific features within the app to reduce its impact on your workflow.\n\nAdjust app settings to optimize performance without uninstalling the app entirely.\n\nUnderstanding these restrictions helps you manage your system more effectively without compromising its functionality.\n\nStep 5: Optimize Storage Beyond App Removal\n\nUninstalling unused apps is just one aspect of effective storage management. To further optimize your Mac’s performance and storage capacity, explore additional tools and options available in the System Settings > Storage menu. This section provides insights into:\n\nLarge files that may be unnecessarily occupying space.\n\nSystem caches and temporary files that can be safely deleted.\n\nOther storage categories, such as documents, downloads, and backups, that may require cleanup.\n\nBy combining app removal with broader storage optimization strategies, you can ensure your Mac operates efficiently and has sufficient space for essential tasks and applications.\n\nMaintain a Clean and Efficient System\n\nProperly uninstalling Mac applications requires more than simply dragging them to the Trash. By using the Storage menu, using built-in uninstallers, and understanding system restrictions, you can ensure that no residual data remains on your device. This systematic approach not only frees up storage space but also enhances your Mac’s overall performance. A well-maintained system allows you to focus on your work and enjoy a seamless computing experience without unnecessary clutter slowing you down.\n\nDiscover other guides from our vast content that could be of interest to you on Mac Apps.\n\nSource & Image Credit: Daniel About Tech\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

Sometimes, you just want to throw an axe around, lay the beat down on a valkyrie or two, and travel across the realms with your son while you mourn your goddess wife, y'know? Pretty much everyone was doing exactly that back in 2018 when God of War came out on the PS4, and since then, we've yearned to take Kratos and Atreus on the go, so we can embark on a treacherous journey to scatter ashes at the highest peak in all the nine realms. As we, too, brave an equally perilous commute.\n\nIt took several years for Sony to release God of War from its exclusive shackles, only coming to PC systems almost a full four years after its initial release. But it further proves that it works fantastically on handheld devices. God of War is Steam Deck verified, meaning Valve's handheld console can, well, handle the intense graphical demands, high-octane gameplay, and gorgeously cinematic cutscenes of arguably one of the greatest action-adventure games of all time. With the Switch 2 offering a significant upgrade to processing power, we see no reason why Sony shouldn't bestow a little mythos to Nintendo's second-gen handheld.\n\nNow, we know as well as anyone that Sony likes to keep a tight lock on its exclusive games. For good reason, because the majority of them are absolutely seminal. But with the likes of The Last of Us 2 on Steam Deck performing so well, we're still surprised that we haven't seen more appear elsewhere. But now that the Switch 2 promises a system worthy of such demanding games, we'd love to see Sony send the infamous Spartan to Nintendo's neck of the woods.\n\nGranted, we're lucky to even see God of War on anything other than the PlayStation. Just look at poor ol' Bloodborne, still stuck within its Sony-shaped prison after all this time (ten years, 27 days, and give or take a couple of hours, not that we're counting or anything), despite a cult following practically begging for one of the best soulslike games of all time to be released on other platforms. Developer FromSoftware even went as far as to create a completely new IP in the form of The Duskbloods, an exclusive to the Switch 2 coming in 2026, which is even more proof that the people (we, and you) yearn for more sprawling adventure games on Nintendo's console.\n\nMaybe once the Nintendo Switch 2 release date rolls around, we'll get whispers from the trees about a God of War port, so you'd better make sure to get your Switch 2 pre-orders in. While you're waiting, check out our picks for the biggest upcoming Switch games, as well as the best action games."}

One such method of heat relief comes in the form of igusa (rush) mats and pillows, as the natural material helps to regulate temperatures with its excellent breathability while also purifying the air, making it the primary material for tatami mats around the nation.\n\nIgusa has been a part of Japanese life since the prehistoric Jomon era (13,000-300 BCE), with evidence of igusa mats found in ancient settlements, and it’s still used in similar ways today, being a popular choice for cushions and thin mats, especially in rural areas. As Studio Ghibli is a keen supporter of traditional culture and rural communities, it’s now stepping in to help keep the culture of rush-making alive with a new collection of products made from the natural material.\n\nThe range has a traditional charm that ties in perfectly with the rural idyll of My Neighbour Totoro, and the forest characters feature on each item in the collection, starting with the “Igusa Candy Pillow” (3,828 yen [US$26.88]).\n\nSo named as the rolled shape and ties on the end are reminiscent of a candy roll, these pillows come in two designs:\n\n▼ Raspberry…\n\n▼ …and Fireworks.\n\nDesigned to be used as a neck pillow while lying on a tatami mat, the height on these can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the ties on the ends.\n\nFilled with polyethylene pipe pieces, the pillow is resistant against heat, helping to keep you cool during summertime naps.\n\nThose wanting a slightly firmer cushion with a more moderate height can opt for the “Tawara Pillow” (3,278 yen), so named as these types of cushions were historically made by filling a straw bag (“tawara”) with materials like buckwheat husks, rice hulls, or straw.\n\nLike the candy pillow, this style is available in the Raspberry and Fireworks designs, but with more urethane chips in the filling, it has slightly more firmness.\n\nNext up, we have a couple of Mini Flat Pillows, in the same designs, priced at 2,728 yen each.\n\nThese ones are filled with polyethylene pipe pieces, and like all the other items in the collection, the rush surface has been specially processed with “hiba essence” extracted from the hiba tree native to Aomori Prefecture, using original technology by the manufacturer.\n\nHiba Essence contains a natural substance called hinokitiol, which has an antibacterial and deodorising effect. The scent also helps to promote relaxation, as it’s one of the beneficial aromas present in forest walks, or “shinrin-yoku” (“forest bathing”) as it’s known in Japan.\n\nWrapping up the collection is a pair of seat cushions, priced at 2,728 yen each.\n\nMeasuring 40 x 40 centimetres (15.7 x 15.7 inches), these are filled with urethane for a relatively thin but supportive two-centimetre cushioning.\n\nIf you really want to bring the forest feel into your home, you can splurge on the final item in the collection — the Igusa Rug.\n\nThis rug will fill your home with the scent of the forest and the charm of Totoro, as he gazes up at the fireworks in a way that’s reminiscent of summer festivals.\n\nAvailable in two sizes, the rug is priced at 8,778 yen for the smaller 140 x 200 centimetre variety, and 14,080 yen for the larger 176-230 centimetre size.\n\nWith all the items manufactured by Ikehiko, a Japanese company that’s been in business since 1886, the range supports local industry and tradition with the the help of Totoro, and it can be purchased at Donguri Kyowakoku stores and online (links below) while stocks last.\n\nSource: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\nTop image: Donguri Kyowakoku\n\nInsert images: Donguri Kyowakoku (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

The patents are directed to solving problems in the entertainment industry and television broadcasting with respect to optimizing the scheduling of live events and “network maps,” which “determine the programs or content displayed by a broadcaster’s channels within certain geographic markets at particular times.”\n\nThe district court ultimately granted Fox’s motion to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim on the ground the patents were ineligible under Section 101. The court said the claims of the patents failed at Alice step one as they were “directed to the abstract ideas of producing network maps and event schedules, respectively, using known generic mathematical techniques,” and at step two the claims failed to show an “inventive concept” as “the machine learning limitations were no more than ‘broad, functionally described, well-known techniques” and claimed “only generic and conventional computing devices.’”\n\nOn appeal, the CAFC agreed that “the patents are directed to the abstract idea of using a generic machine learning technique in a particular environment, with no inventive concept.” While Recentive argued that its application of machine learning in the patents is not generic because it improved the technology by manipulating the algorithms to function so that “the maps and schedules are automatically customizable and updated with real-time data,” the CAFC said Recentive conceded that the patents do not claim a specific method of improving the algorithm. Furthermore, neither the claims nor the specifications describe how any improvement was accomplished via steps or otherwise. “[T]he only thing the claims disclose about the use of machine learning is that machine learning is used in a new environment,” wrote the CAFC.\n\nThe claims are also are not rendered eligible just because they perform a task previously carried out by humans with greater speed and efficiency. “We have consistently held, in the context of computer-assisted methods, that such claims are not made patent eligible under § 101 simply because they speed up human activity,” the opinion said. That applies whether the issue is raised at step one or step two, it added.\n\nTurning to Alice step two, the CAFC rejected Recentive’s argument that the inventive concept of the claims is “using machine learning to dynamically generate optimized maps and schedules based on real-time data and update them based on changing conditions.” It instead agreed with the district court that this amounted to nothing more than claiming the abstract idea itself.\n\nThe opinion ended with a note that “[m]achine learning is a burgeoning and increasingly important field and may lead to patent-eligible improvements in technology.” The court explained that its instant opinion held “only that patents that do no more than claim the application of generic machine learning to new data environments, without disclosing improvements to the machine learning models to be applied, are patent ineligible under § 101.”\n\nPillsbury Wintrhrop Shaw Pittman LLP, which represented Fox, said in a statement sent to IPWatchdog that the decision “affirms our longstanding contention that technological improvements created merely by the ordinary use of generic machine language (or AI) are not patent eligible.” Pillsbury added that the CAFC’s ruling “has far-reaching implications, as courts and companies grapple with the best way to commercialize and use new AI technologies across a wide range of fields.”\n\nImage Source: Deposit Photos\n\nAuthor: alexmillos\n\nImage ID: 35440567"}
