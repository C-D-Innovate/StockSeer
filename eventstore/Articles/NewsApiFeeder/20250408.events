This is basically the “heart” of Yakread, the whole reason I\nwanted to make the app in the first place. (And it's about 200 lines of\ncode.\nFunny how much additional stuff has to be layered on top just to make those 200\nlines of code usable.)\nThis part of the algorithm does three main things: it picks which subscription\nposts to recommend; it picks which bookmarked articles to recommend; and it\ndecides in what order to mix those posts and articles together. The end result\nis a batch of, say, 30 items which will be displayed to the user on their For\nYou feed.\n(Instead of “posts” and “articles”, I typically use the more general term\n“item”, which is a common term for things that recommender systems recommend.)\nFirst we take all your unread bookmarked items and sort them by how many times\nyou've scrolled past them previously. For items with the same number of “skips,”\nwe sort by how recently the item was bookmarked. “Fresher” items (those that\nhave been skipped less and were bookmarked more recently) come first.\nTo shake things up a bit, we then partially shuffle the items. I wrote a simple\nshuffle algorithm that has a bias toward leaving items close to their original\nspots. There's a “randomness” parameter (I'll call it p) you can set between 0\nand 1: 0 will make the algorithm behave like a completely random shuffle, and 1\nwill leave the items in their original order.\nI've set p to 0.1. That might make it sound like the items will be\nmostly-but-not-completely in random order, minimizing the impact of the initial\nsort-by-freshness. However, the parameter affects the randomness in a non-linear\nway. The following graph approximately shows the probability that the first item\nin the shuffled list will be one of the first ten items in the original list (y\naxis), given different values for p (x axis):\n\n(The formula technically needs one more term that takes into account the size of\nthe original list; however, if the original list is at least 50 ish items then\nthat term is pretty small.)\nSo for p = 0.1, there's a 65% chance the first bookmark item will be one of\nthe ten freshest items. I might tweak that parameter based on gut feel after I\nstart using the rewritten app.\nThe final step for bookmark recommendations is that we look at the items’ URLs\nand only recommend at most one bookmark per website (host). I added this filter\nbecause about six months ago I bookmarked a few hundred articles from a\nparticular website, and they still dominate my Yakread feed. I already had a\nfilter like this for subscriptions (each batch of subscriptions includes at most\none item per subscription).\nSubscription recommendations have two main steps: first we pick a list of\nsubscriptions to recommend (and in which order); then pick one item from each\nsubscription.\nI'll knock out the second step first: it's basically the same as the bookmark\nalgorithm. We sort the items by freshness, do our randomish-shuffle thing, then\npick the first item in the resulting list.\nTo pick the subscriptions in the first place, first we calculate an “affinity\nscore” for each subscription that represents how much you like it. I look at the\n10 most recent interactions you've had with each subscription:\nTo turn those interactions into a single score, I’ve currently assigned\nsomewhat-arbitrary weights to each interaction (e.g. +2 for a view and -1 for\na skip) and then I take the “beta distribution expected value,” which means: if\nyou’re flipping a coin and +2 represents getting heads twice while -1\nrepresents getting tails once, what is the probability of getting a heads next?\nAlso, to help new subscriptions get more exposure, I give them a starting score\nof +3.\nThis approach is simple and seems to work well enough (when I use the score to\nquery for my own top/bottom 10 subscriptions, the results seem reasonable). It\nwould be nice to remove the need for me to pick weights though. At some point I\nmight try using some kind of machine learning model that can take a list of\ninteractions and predict the probabilities of what the next interaction will be\n(apparently an RNN would work). Then the score can be the probability that the\nnext action is positive (i.e. a view or a like).\nAfter sorting the subscriptions by their affinity score, we give some extra\npriority to subscriptions that the user has manually pinned. We split the\nsubscriptions into two lists, pinned and unpinned. Then we interleave those\nthose lists back into a single list by repeatedly picking from which of the two\nlists to take the next interleaved subscription.\nMost of the time we simply pick whichever subscription (pinned or unpinned) has\nthe highest affinity score. But 30% of the time, we pick the next pinned\nsubscription regardless of affinity.\nAfter doing all that, we do our random-ish shuffle thing on the subscriptions\nlist, then we move on to the step described above where we pick an item from\neach subscription.\nAt this point we have a list of subscription items and a list of bookmarked\nitems, and we need to interleave them into a final list which will be shown to\nthe user. An easy and not terrible approach would be to flip a coin for each\nitem in the final list: heads and it comes from subscriptions, tails and it\ncomes from bookmarks. And at a base level, that is what I’m doing.\nHowever, that could have issues if the user has more subscription items than\nbookmarks or vice versa. If you’ve already scrolled past all your unread\nbookmarked items several times but you have a bunch of new subscription items,\nwe should probably lean towards recommending the subscription items.\nI do this by comparing the two lists pairwise and selecting an item via weighted\nrandom choice based on how many times they’ve been previously skipped (i.e.\nscrolled past in the For You feed). e.g. if the first bookmark item has been\nskipped twice and the first subscription item has been skipped once, then\nthere’ll be a 60% chance we select the subscription item and a 40% chance we\nselect the bookmark item.\nPublished 7 Apr 2025\nI write an occasional newsletter about my work and ideas.\nError: It looks like that email is invalid.

Our Editorial Team appreciates your cooperation in keeping these guidelines in mind as you prepare articles for submission. Our team reviews every article, but following the style guidelines will expedite the editorial process.\nPlease be aware that this style guide is a living document and as such continues to evolve. If it has been a while since you have submitted an article for The Earth Observer, please be sure you are using the latest version of the Style Guide. The date of the most recent update is printed in the footer of the document to make it easier to maintain the most current version of the document.\nEditing is sometimes more art than science, and while the Editorial Team will endeavor to follow the rules that follow in most cases, there may be specific cases where the Executive Editor may decide to deviate from these guidelines.\nThe EO has a robust editorial team to assist with the editorial process to maintain the quality and style of the publication.\nThe EO editorial staff includes:\nThe editorial process is iterative. The author will typically go through two rounds of edits with the EO Editorial Team. The text is then put into a preview layout on a staging server for the author’s final review before the story is published on the EO website.\nThe Earth Observer provides authors an opportunity to tell their compelling stories of Earth Science. As such it does not impose strict word count limits, but the EO has established certain general guidelines that provide a framework to follow for several types of articles.\nGeneral article format\nPlease write articles in MS Word and save as a .doc file.\nThe article should begin with an introduction that provides the essentials – who, what, where, when, and why – to provide the reader with an overview of the topic to be discussed. For articles about meetings include the number of people who attended (e.g., in-person and virtual) and the objective of the meeting.\nThe introduction paragraph is followed by a transition paragraph that takes the reader into the main content of the article. The article should wrap up with a conclusion.\nThe suggested page length for each type of article includes inserted visual elements. In addition to the Word file, please also send separate higher resolution files for graphics, photos, animations, or visualizations. More specific requirements are available in the Guidelines for Graphics, Photos, Visualizations, Animations.\nAnnouncement article\nAnnouncement articles promote a variety of topics. Historically this type of article includes releases of new or updated Earth Science data products, information on new tools for processing and viewing data, previews of outreach activities for the Science Support Office (e.g., AGU, Earth Day), and details on upcoming science meetings or workshops (i.e., beyond the information conveyed on the NASA science calendar).\nThe article is structured like a Feature article, but it is shorter, no more than two pages, including graphics and captions – see Guidelines for Graphics, Photos, Visualizations, Animations.\nFor Example: NASA Invites You to Create Landsat-Inspired Arts and Crafts, The Earth Observer, Mar–Apr 2021, 33:4, 13–14. Other examples are available on the archived issues of The Earth Observer.\nIf you have an idea for an Announcement article, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\nFeature article\nFeature articles cover a wide range of Earth science topics, including satellite mission launches and historic milestones, field campaign updates, data processing tool tutorials, and summaries of NASA Science Support Office outreach events. Typically, these articles span ~8–14 pages (3000–4000 words). There are cases where longer or shorter articles are acceptable.\nA photo essay format for some topics, such as outreach event summaries, offer an option to convey a significant portion of the information using a collection of photos and descriptive captions.\nFor Example: Looking Back on Looking Up: The 2024 Total Solar Eclipse\nIf you have an idea for an Feature article, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\nHybrid article\nHybrid articles combine elements of a Feature and a Summary article. Often, these articles start with a few pages of descriptive text about the subject, followed by a summary of a particular meeting. Owing to their hybrid nature, these articles tend to run a bit longer than the standard Summary article. These articles typically range between 8–12 pages (3000–5000 words.)\nIf you have an idea for a Hybrid article, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\nIn Memoriam article\nIn Memoriam articles recognize individuals who have played prominent roles in NASA Earth Science. These articles tend to include biographical information about the deceased individual, a brief mention of their education, and a summary of their major career achievements – with emphasis on achievements related to NASA. A typical In Memoriam article layout includes one or more photos, including one of the person being memorialized.\nFor Example: In Memoriam: Mary Cleave [1947–2023] The In Memoriam link provides recent examples of In Memoriam articles published in The Earth Observer. Other articles are available by searching the publication’s archived issues.\nThis type of article is structured like a Feature article with the exception that the subject is referred to by their first name. In Memoriam drafts should be no more than two pages in Word – including graphics and captions – see Guidelines for Graphics, Photos, Visualizations, Animations.\nIf you know someone to eulogize in The Earth Observer for their contributions to NASA Earth Science, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\nKudos article\nKudos articles acknowledges individuals or groups either within or connected to (funded by) NASA who receive significant NASA-wide awards.\nA Kudo article follows a structure similar to a Feature article. It should be a maximum of one page in Word – including a photo of person(s) or group being honored – see Guidelines for Graphics, Photos, Visualizations, Animations.\nFor Example: MOPITT Canadian Principal Investigator Receives Two Awards, The Earth Observer, Mar–Apr 2021, 33:2, 28 [bottom]. Other examples are available by searching through archived issues of The Earth Observer.\nIf you know an individual or a group of people worthy of recognition for their NASA-related achievement, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft submission. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\nSummary article\nSummary articles provide an overview of recent scientific meetings and/or workshops. Ideally, a Summary article should be no more than 6 pages (~2500 words).\nProvide the flavor of the event rather than describe it in detail. Summarize the overall nature and sense of sessions. The Editorial Team has found that a mix of narrative descriptions of key (usually programmatic) presentations (e.g., plenary sessions) and summaries with less detail for the remaining (e.g., technical) presentations is optimum.\nNow that The Earth Observer is published online, it is the view of the Editorial Team format summary articles using a “minutes-style” report of the meeting. While space no longer precludes publishing such an article as it did in the past, the format does not translate well to the online communication medium. Unless a reader is really interested in the specific topic(s) discussed in the article, it is likely that they will not scroll through to the end – no matter how nice the layout looks.\nIf you have an idea for a Summary article, please email the EO Editorial Team who will work with you on a draft. The EO Editorial Team emails are available in the section – The Earth Observer Editorial Process\nEOis a hybrid publication, landing somewhere between a science journal and popular science magazine. Therefore, the focus should be on phenomena rather than data. The article provides an opportunity to publicize your mission, research to ~1653 subscribers (as of August 2024) around the world. Please review the content in this guideline before writing your article and reach out to the Editorial Team if you have any questions.\nWriting for the web\nThe EO audience ranges from scientists to the general public. When writing an article, use plain language and active voice. When in doubt, write the article so that it would be understandable to a friend or relative not in the field.\nFor Example:\nPassive voice: The rate of evaporation is controlled by the size of an opening.\nActive voice: The size of an opening controls the rate of evaporation.\nAvoid using jargon and technical language. When it is necessary to use technical language, please use ITALICS to offset the word in the text. Follow the italicized word with a brief definition or explanation.\nFor Example: Inference – formally derived uncertainty for area estimates of biomass, height, or other metrics – can take different forms, each of which includes specific assumptions. In this breakout session, participants considered the strengths and limitations of different inference types (e.g., intensity of computation or the ability to use different models).\nWriting content for a website differs from print. The human eye is more inclined to read shorter paragraphs separated by breaks. It is ideal to keep sentences and paragraphs short.\nUse one space after a period. The two spaces after a period is an artifact of conventional type writers.\nAvoid editorializing in the article. For example, do not characterize a spacewalk as “daring” or “dangerous.” Describe the events factually. If things are described well, readers easily can decide for themselves whether they are daring or dangerous. Never, under any circumstances, insert any personal, political, ideological, or religious opinions or beliefs into NASA news media products.\nCatchy headline\nWrite a headline that is short, searchable, and shareable. Try to keep the headline to 60 characters (including spaces). Longer headlines may be invisible to search engines.\nUnlike journal articles, The Earth Observer only includes individuals who made a significant contributions to the EO article. A typical article should only lists one or two authors. In some occasions, an article may have up to four authors. The authors should be formatted as follows:\nFirst Last, Organization, author email\nIf there are more you wish to give credit, consider doing so in an Acknowledgment section, as discussed in the next paragraph.\nNaming files\nFor consistency moving documents through the editorial process, please name the file by the file type, the topic, and the author’s last name.\nFor Example: announcement_topic_author\n feature_topic_author\n hybrid_topic_author\n memoriam_topic_author\n kudos_topic_author\n summary_topic_author\nUse visuals to draw the reader in\nThe Earth Observer is now published online. Visual elements are critical to all EO stories and are a required element to submissions. The Editorial Team would prefer having too many graphics (i.e., photos, figures, animations, and visualizations) than too few. It is helpful to insert this content into the Word file as well as include the graphics as separate files at the time of the initial submission of the draft for editorial review. See the Guidelines for Graphics, Photos, Visualizations, Animations section for more information.\nSearch engine optimization\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) is a broad set of techniques to capitalize how search engines, such as Google, scrub content on the internet. By optimizing how articles are written, it is possible to influence where content shows up in an organic, online search. The different approaches can fill an entire book. This style guide provides a few pointers to help tweak articles to optimize how the content appears in online searches.\nHeadline and subheads\nA headline should be clear and compelling to reveal what the content is about as well as entice the searcher to click for more. A SEO headline is a ranking factor in search engine results. A headline can be crafted to rank higher in search results, which increases an article’s visibility and generate more clicks. This can be done by using SEO search terms — those terms that a person would type into a search box — in the headline. Shorter headlines (i.e., 60 characters including spaces) are often more effective during searches.\nSubheads provide a way to organize an article and separates the content into digestible sections. Like headlines, subheads can be optimized for SEO searches. Subheads may include key takeaways from the specific section. Keep subheads clear and concise.\nLinks\nEarth Observer articles are now being posted online. Footnotes are no longer a functional option, which is a significant change for authors who have published articles in our print issues in the past. It is helpful to hyperlink words or short phrases in the article that directs the reader to additional content from the meeting, such as presentations, poster sessions, talks by attendees, programs/satellites, journal articles, etc. Relevant links should also be added to captions. See the Hyperlinks section for guidance on how to insert and format a hyperlink in the article.\nInternal links tie content in the article to other pages within an organization, such as NASA, to boost site authority. External links direct a reader to sites outside the organization. This approach also drives up site authority in SEO searches. By connecting relevant pages, it will improve article navigation and ensure users can locate relevant information.\nAlternate text for graphics\nAlternate text, or alt text, is the small description added to visual elements on the back end of a website. Search engines use the alt text to identify relevant content. Alt text also improves accessibility for all users. Tools that read webpages aloud can read alt text to help explain what visual elements contain for the visually impaired.\nAlt text should be concise, accurate, and use keywords. Keywords are highly relevant words or phrases associated with the picture and the content of the article.\nFor Example: Figure 1. Forty SWOT Early Adopter (EA) teams span the globe with a wide range of operational and applied science project topics.\nFigure credit: NASA\nKey word tag: A global map showing the locations of early adopter organizations.\nSubmitting An Outline\nAn outline is not requiredprior to submitting the first draft of an article, but an outline may be beneficial for lengthy articles (i.e., features, hybrids). Outlines are particularly helpful for first-time authors or when an author is seeking guidance about the appropriateness of content for The Earth Observer. It is hard for the team to comment without seeing something in writing. More generally, submitting an outline presents an opportunity for the editorial team to provide input on the article during the writing process – as opposed to waiting until the first draft is submitted.\nSubmitting Your Draft\nDo not submit a draft for review unless it is complete (i.e., contains all visual elements, captions, credits, and content). Unless you clearly indicate otherwise, the Editorial Team will assume your submission is ready for them to review. Version control problems result when text is updated after reviews have started.\nThe initial draft submitted for editorial review should include graphics. including captions and credits. The editorial process is delayed when graphics, credits, and captions are added iteratively once the process has begun.\nOver more than 35 years as a NASA publication, The Earth Observer has developed its own unique style. Please review these specific guidelines detailed below, and let the Editorial Team know if you have any questions. In addition, The Earth Observer also adheres to the NASA Stylebook and Communications Manual, 9th edition (June 2020), which is closely aligned with the AP Stylebook.\nAcronyms\nScience is rife with acronyms. On first usage, always spell out the acronym and follow with the acronym in parenthesis. From that point on in the article, use the acronym. To ensure photos, figures, visualizations, and animations are understandable if removed from the larger text, please spell out acronyms in captions.\nWell-known acronyms (e.g., NASA, U.S., etc.) do not need to be spelled out. Separate the acronym for United States (e.g., U.S.) and United Kingdom (e.g., U.K.) with periods.\nFor Example: Level-1 (L1), Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), International Space Station (ISS), Precision Orbit Determination (POD), etc.\nOnly capitalize proper nouns as defined by the dictionary or AP style. The Earth Observer style does capitalize the first letter of a specific product that will be turned into an acronym.\nFor Example: Do not capitalize the first letter of each word in “solid rocket booster (SBR),” even though the subsequent use of the acronym SRB will appear in the article.\nA compound acronym arises when parentheses occur inside of parentheses. In this situation, use [BRACKETS] for the outer set of parentheses and (PARENTHESES) for those inside.\nFor Example: Thomas Neumann [GSFC—Deputy Director of GSFC’s Earth Sciences Division (ESD)] welcomed meeting participants on behalf of the ESD.\nAffiliations\nUse a possessive for an organization when it is part of NASA. Do not use a possessive when using the agency as an adjective.\nFor Example: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC); subsequent references would just use “GSFC.”\nFor Example: SWOT data products available through PO.DAAC provides centralized, searchable access that is available using an in-cloud commercial web service through the NASA EarthData portal.\nWrite out an organization that is not part of NASA.\nFor Example: Gustavo Oliveira [Clark University] presented details on the project \"Irrigation as Climate-Change Adaptation in the Cerrado Biome of Brazil.\"\nWhen multiple “levels” of affiliation are listed, start with the “top-level” affiliation as a possessive followed by lower level. If the affiliations are mentioned again later in the article, only the acronym for the lowest level needs to be repeated.\nFor Example: For NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO), subsequent references to this entity would be “GMAO.”\nFor Example: For University of Maryland, Baltimore County’s Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC), subsequent references to this entity would be “ESSIC.”\nWhen a person is affiliated with two (or more) distinct entities, separate the two entities by slashes.\nFor Example: Project Scientist Felix Landerer (NASA/JPL), followed by detailed assessments of the G-FO mission and operations status from the core SDS centers and flight operations teams.\nWhen a NASA Center and contractor are listed, please list the NASA Center followed by contractor and separate the two entities by a slash.\nFor Example: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)/Global Science & Technology, Inc. (GST).\nCapitalize Earth, Moon, Sun\nNASA capitalizes the first letter in Earth, Moon, and Sun.In addition, do not use the modified ‘the’ before Earth.\nFor Example: This strategy acknowledges the urgency of global changes, such as accelerating environmental shifts, understanding Earth’s interconnected systems, and developing scalable information. \nChemical formulas\nChemical formulas should be treated like acronyms. Spell out a chemical formula upon first use in an article followed by the chemical formula in parenthesis. Use appropriate subscripts and superscripts in the chemical formula. From that point onward, use the chemical formula in the article.\nFor Example: The data show that global and East Asian emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) have decreased since 2010, contrasting India and Southeast Asia’s rising trends. In Southeast Asia, NOx and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions increased from 1990–2018, while black carbon (BC) emissions peaked in 2007.\nCompound words\nMake one word out of all compound words (e.g., multipurpose, multiangle).\nException: Hyphenate cases where the same vowel repeats (e.g., bio-optical, multi-imager).\nCross-references\nIt is common to reference a previous EO article to provide context and background for the current story. The Editorial Staff recommends authors cross-reference prior EOarticle. The title of the article, volume, issue, and page range in parenthesis. The information should be italicized, except for “The Earth Observer,” which should be plain text.\nThe name of the cross-referenced article should be hyperlinked to that article. You can find past Earth Observer newsletters on the archive page.\nFor Example: ESIP was created in response to a National Research Council (NRC) review of the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). (To learn more about EOSDIS, see Earth Science Data Operations: Acquiring, Distributing, and Delivering NASA Data for the Benefit of Society, in the March–April 2017 issue of The Earth Observer [Volume 29, Issue 2, pp. 4–18].) As NASA’s first Earth Observing System (EOS) missions were launching or preparing to launch, the NRC called on NASA to develop a new, distributed structure that would be operated and managed by the Earth science community and would include observation and research, application, and education data.\nDates, months, and seasons\nWhen referencing a date, spell out the month, followed by the day (if included) and year. This style differs from AP. A comma always follows a year if the date is written in-line of the sentence.\nFor Example: January 27, 2022; January 2022\nFor Example: PACE launched on February 8, 2024, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\nCapitalize a season followed by a year, but not when just referring to a season.\nFor Example: Spring 2022; summer\nSpell out time zones, such as Eastern Daylight Time, and thereafter replace with the acronym (i.e., EDT).\nFor Example: In Cleveland, the eclipse began at 1:59 PM. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), with totality spanning 3:13–3:17 PM.\nDirections and regions\nEO articles follow AP style for directions (e.g., north, south, east, west, northeast, southwest, norther, western, southern, eastern). The directions should be lowercase when indicating a compass direction and when it is used to describe sections of states or cities.\nFor Example: The cold front is moving east.\nThe direction should be capitalized for a proper name or large regions. \nFor Example: NASA’s South/Southeast Asia Research Initiative (SARI) is a regional initiative under the LCLUC program that addresses the critical needs of the South/Southeast Asia region.\nFor Example: West Virginia or North Dakota\nFootnotes\nThe Earth Observer has transitioned to an online publication. Footnotes will no longer be used in articles. Instead of footnotes, the publication will use hyperlinks to direct readers to additional content. Refer to the section on Hyperlinks for more information on how to include a hyperlink in an article. A good mantra to follow – if you are unsure if a reference is needed, leave it out.\nFormal titles\nFormal titles, such as Ms. or Dr., are used in articles that are more personal, such as Kudos, In Memoriam, and The Editor’s Corner. For all other articles, the professional title is not used. When you introduce a person in the story, present the name in BOLD followed by their agency and position in ITALICS, offset by brackets.\nFor Example: First Last [Agency—Job Title] began by providing an update on the status of the new launch date for the. . . .\nAfter the individual is introduced in the article, EO style follows a particular style for using the name again. If the individual’s name is included in the same paragraph where the person was introduced, only use the last name [UNBOLD]. If the individual is mentioned later in the article, several paragraphs removed from introduction, use the full name [FIRST LAST, UNBOLD].\nHyperlinks, the how and the why\nPrior to moving online, The Earth Observer used footnotes to reference information in an article. The online publication will now use hyperlinks to refer the reader to additional content on a topic. As a general rule, hyperlink content regarding missions, instruments, field campaigns, models, papers, and other programs named in the article. It is not necessary to link to each individual institution mentioned when individuals are identified in summaries.\nHow to insert a hyperlink\nThe first step in this process is to identify the anchor text to highlight in the sentence. The anchor text includes a word or phrase that points the reader to additional content.\nFor Example: Anchor text: Volume 35 Issue 6 of The Earth Observer\nFind the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the webpage. The URL is an address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet.\nFor Example: URL: https://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/eo_pdfs/EO%20Nov-Dec%202023-Digital%20508.pdf\nNote: When inserting a link to a prior published article from The Earth Observer’s archive, be certain to capture the URL for the first page of the referenced article, as opposed to the issue’s first page.\nTo insert a hyperlink, copy the URL from the website where the additional content can be found. Select the word or phrase to use as anchor text. Do not include an acronym as part of the anchor text for a hyperlink. Select the hyperlink command under the Insert dropdown menu. Paste the URL into the link box. Be sure the ‘Web Page or File’ tab is selected (not the Email tab). The hyperlinked text will appear blue and underlined.\nFor Example: It is possible to find this information in Volume 35 Issue 6 of The Earth Observer.\nFor Example: The Hyperwall presentation highlighted recent discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mission. \nHyphens, en dashes, and em dashes—oh my!!\nHyphen: - A hyphen is used to separate compound adjectives or words. \nFor Example: The satellite reached a near-Earth orbit.\nEn Dash: – An en dash spans the length of a typed lowercase ‘n.’ This special character is used to separate numbers.\nFor Example: The meeting was held March 5–8 in Denver, CO. [Note there is no space between the numbers in this example.]\nThe Earth Observer style follows the NASA style guide that uses an en dash to insert a pause in the sentence. The en dash is set apart by a space on either side. In this instance, the en dash is used instead of an em dash.\nFor Example: The passport identified six hidden images – all six posters from the Science Explorers Poster Series– strategically placed within the exhibit’s perimeter.\nYou can insert an en dash in Word on a Mac by typing the “Option” and “hyphen/dash” keys simultaneously.\nYou can also insert an en dash in Word using the Insert tab and select Advanced Symbols. A box will open with a variety of characters. Select “Garamond” from the Font pulldown menu (Garamond is the newsletter’s preferred font), then select the – symbol (or “en dash”) from the array of options displayed. You will then see a confirmation of your selection appear below the symbol options (i.e., “Insert [Garamond] character 150 (Unicode character 2013).” Please note: the character number (150 in the case of Garamond) could be different. For example, an en dash in Palatino font is character 208.\nEm Dash: — An em dash spans the length of a typed lowercase ‘m.’ This special character is used when separating the organization and the job title when introducing a person in the article. In other styles, the em dash is used as a pause in a sentence. Following NASA style guidelines, the pause is provided by the en dash.\nFor Example: Thomas Neumann [GSFC—Deputy Director of GSFC’s Earth Sciences Division (ESD)] welcomed meeting participants on behalf of the ESD.\nYou can insert an em dash in Word by going to the Insert tab and selecting Advanced Symbols. A box will open with a variety of characters. Select character 151. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the section above regarding how to insert an en dash.\nItalics and quotes\nPlace Latin phrases in ITALICS (e.g., in situ, a priori, ad hoc, ex officio) on every appearance in the article. Do not italicize abbreviated Latin phrases (e.g., i.e., a.k.a., et al.). Use the Latin phrase i.e., instead of ‘such as’ and e.g., instead of ‘that is to say.’\nFor Example: The Afternoon Satellite Constellation, a.k.a., the“A-Train,” can see Earth in a whole new dimension.\nFor Example: Guy Schumann [Water in Sight]explained this Swedish start-up company uses SWOT data to validate in situ gauge data in Malawi.\nPlace technical language in the text in ITALICS followed by a definition. Only use the italics on the first usage of the word.\nFor Example:There were several large polynyas – areas of open ice where sea ice would be expected – detected.\nItems in a series\nThe Earth Observer deviates from AP style in the use of commas in a list or series. Use the Oxford comma in a series of items.\nFor Example: The sensor measures at three different wavelengths corresponding to blue, green, red, and infrared light.\nIn more complex series where one of the items is a series of items within a series, it is permissible to use semi-colons to separate the series (see below).\nFor Example: The blue, green, and red channels; the two-infrared channels; and ultraviolet channel were all impacted.\nNumbers\nIn the article, spell out zero to nine. Use numerals for any number greater than or equal to 10. If a sentence contains several numbers, excluding a year, that are both greater than and less than 10, use the numerals for all numbers.\nFor Example: Improving the data calibrations of the acceler­ometer measurements – which are noise contaminated on one of the two G-FO spacecraft – remains a core focus of the project SDS team.\nFor Example: The NASA Hyperwall served as the backdrop for 57 Hyperwall Storiesat the meeting, including 8 presentations delivered by the 2023 winnersof the AGU Michael Freilich Student Visualization Competition.\nFor Example: Following the project team’s status presentations, there was a 30-minute session to answer questions from the science community and discuss in more detail the mission performance, near-term operations and data processing plans, as well as to gather suggestions and feedback from the community.\nOrdinal numbers\nOrdinal numbers are words representing position or rank in sequential order. The EO follows AP rules in how to present ordinal numbers in an article. Spell out one through nine and use figures for 10 and above. This rule holds for article headlines and subheads.\nFor Example: AEOIP Holds Third Annual Workshop\nFor Example: As GPM is now well into its 10th year in orbit, the time is fitting to reflect on and celebrate what this mission has accomplished and showcase its contributions to science and society.\nReferences\nThe Earth Observer is not a peer-reviewed journal and typically does not include a list of references. It is helpful to hyperlink key words/phrases to other resources, such as journal articles. See Hyperlinks section to learn how to insert and format this text.\nIn rare instances when a formal reference is required (e.g., referencing a Figure that originally appeared in another journal article), please use theAmerican Meteorological Society format.\nReferences to teams\nIn a story, spell out “Science Team (ST)” in the first instance and use the team acronym from that point forward in the story.\nFor Example: The Precipitation Measurement Mission (PMM) Science Team (ST) includes more than 20 international partners.\nFor other named teams, use the initial caps for the team name and then use “Team” as shorthand afterwards (e.g., “Informatics Team” first time, then abbreviate as “Team” subsequently).\nDo not capitalize generic references to a team (e.g., a team of experts).\nState abbreviations\nThe Earth Observer differs from AP style in how it presents state abbreviations. This publication uses the two-letter postal code for state abbreviations.\nFor Example: The meeting was held March 5–8 in Denver, CO.\nTypographical emphasis\nPlease do not use specialized typographic formatting (e.g., Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.). Instead, please use internal formatting (e.g., BOLD and ITALIC) as directed in the style guide (e.g., headings, subheads, author/speaker names, etc.). If you do use the specialized typographic formatting, it affects the insertion and layout of text on the EO website, which takes time to correct and slows publication.\nWhen inserting a table, do not use framed or shaded boxes.\nUnits\nDo not spell out units. Use the standard abbreviation. Include both English and metric units in the text. One exception is The Editor’s Corner column, which does not use both the English and metric units.\nFor Example: The data collected from G/G-FO has a native resolution of about 300 km (~186 mi).\nThe EO supports several visual options to enhance the text of an article. A figure refers to a visual display of data. An photo refers to a photograph. An animation is a series of images or model results that illustrate a concept. A visualization is a video of content.\nTo maintain a consistent design for The Earth Observer, please insert the graphic, photo, animation, or visualization in the appropriate location in the Word document. Along with the Word document, please submit the photo, graphic, visualization, or animation as separate files. \nInserting figures, photos, animations, and visualizations\nUpon first usage in the text, include the correct graphic descriptor (i.e., figure, photo, animation, or visualization) and appropriate number in the text in bold. Restart numbering for each visual element type (e.g., Figure 1, Photo 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Photo 2, Visualization 1).\nFor Example: The GMI is a 13-channel conically scanning PMW radiometer providing observations across a wide swath (885 km or ~550 mi) to estimate precipitation – see Figure 1.\nThe EO editorial staff ask that no additional formatting be used when inserting these files into the Word document. At the location in the text where the photo, figure, animation, or visualization should appear in the story, advance the text by two lines. Place the cursor in the first blank line. Go to the insert tab and select the picture icon. Select ‘Picture from File’ from the dropdown. Navigate to the location on your computer where the file is located and select ‘Insert.’\nCaption, credit, and tags\nAfter inserting the figure, photo, visualization, or animation, provide a caption and credit. It is important to think of the caption and credit as stand-alone items in the story.\nThe graphic may need to be revised to accommodate EO style. Remove indicators, ‘a’, b’, etc from panels or items of note. EO style requires that different panels or points of interest in the graph should use “pointers,” such as top, middle, bottom.\nThe caption should be descriptive and not overly technical. It should convey the content in image/figure without relying too heavily on the surrounding text to add context. Relevant links should also be added to captions. Spell out all acronyms, whether for equipment or institutions, are already spelled out in the text, because the image can be lifted from the article and used without the article where it originated. The pointer in the caption should be enclosed in brackets and the text ITALICIZED (e.g., [left]).\nThe credit line should include the name of the institution or individual who should be credited for the image/figure/photograph. If an institution is listed, write the name [NO ITALICS]. Ifan individual is listed, include their institution in brackets. If the credit refers to a journal article, please use a reference to the journal (e.g., Williams et al. 2024) and link the credit reference to the DOI for the journal article. Note: there is no period after the credit line.\nFor Example:\nPhoto 1. Group photo of 2024 Quadrennial Ozone Symposium in-person attendees at the University of Colorado, Boulder’s University Memorial Center.\nPhoto credit: Chelsea Thompson [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]\nPhoto 2. Sophie Godin-Beekman presents awards during the QOS dinner. Luke Western accepts the Dobson Award [left]; [Herman Smith receives the Farman award [middle]; and Valerie Thouret accepts the Farman award on behalf of Philippe Nédélec [right].\nPhoto credits: Irina Petropavlovskikh [CIRES Global Monitoring Laboratory]\nFigure 1.Annual mean anomalies of ozone (%) in the upper stratosphere [top three panels] near 42 km (26 mi) altitude or 2-hPa pressure, and for the lower stratosphere, [bottom three panels] near 22 km (14 mi) or 50 hPa for three zonal bands: 35°N–60°N [top graph in each grouping] , 20°S–20°N [middle graph in each grouping], and 35°S–60°S [bottom graph in each grouping]. Anomalies are with respect to the 1998–2008 baseline. Colored lines correspond to different long-term satellite records. The black line is the merged ground-based dataset. The gray-shaded area shows the range of chemistry–climate model simulations from CCMI-1 refC2 (SPARC/IO3C/GAW 2019).\nFigure credit: from the BAMS State of the Climate in 2023\nAlong with the caption, please include alternate keywords to include with the graphic. The alternative text does not appear with the article, but is added to the backend of website (i.e., Content Management System). The alt text aids in SEO. See the section on Search Engine Optimization for additional guidance.\nKey word tag: A global map showing the locations of early adopter organizations.\nIf a figure or photo contain multiple elements, provide directionals in the caption to direction the reader to the different elements. The directionals should be italicized and in brackets. When referencing multiple Figures at once, use an en dash to separate the figure numbers.\nFor Example [in text]: After the presentation, the attendees heard from Karen St. Germain [NASA HQ—Director of NASA’s Earth Science Division], who gave inspiring remarks and answered questions for 15 minutes – see Photos 6–7.\nFor Example: Photos 6–7. Former NASA astronaut Paul Richards takes audience questions at the NASA Earth Day event. Credit: NASA\nFor Example: Figure 2.

Figure credit: Williams et al. 2024\nGraphic/photo requirements\nThere are many style topics not specified here. As stated earlier, the NASA Stylebook and Communications Manual and AP Style Guide (in that order) should be followed when something is not explicitly described in this guide.\nIn addition, previous articles from The Earth Observer (particularly those from recent years) can serve as templates for future articles. It is a good idea when preparing to submit an article to look at some previous articles available in The Earth Observer archive.\nThe Earth Observer: Editorial GuidelinesLast Updated: 01/30/25 \nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery."}

In response to President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports to the U.S., many Canadians are boycotting American goods, particularly whiskey. \nViral videos show Canadian liquor store employees pushing carts with popular American whiskey brands like Jack Daniels and Maker’s Mark into the back of stores, instead encouraging consumers to “buy Canadian.”\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nWhile there are economic and political reasons for targeting whiskey in trying to retaliate against the U.S., there is an additional motive at play. Canadians are trying to damage an American industry that has long sought to position itself as central to the U.S.’s history and identity. For example, in 2011 Jack Daniels, the number one selling whiskey in the U.S., launched its “As American As” advertising campaign. The ads depicted images of classic Americana—blue jeans, cowboy hats, and white picket fences—while a voiceover claimed: “We’re the creators of things born of an independent spirit.” Other popular American whiskey brands like Bulleit, 1792, and High West proclaim their association with the American frontier and perceived American values like individualism and perseverance.\nYet, despite this imagery, the whiskey industry has been shaped by global forces for close to a century. These forces helped it to grow in the post-World War II period as American cultural influence spread around the globe. Today, it leaves whiskey producers vulnerable to the sorts of boycotts now taking place in Canada. \nRead More: Using Tariffs to Try to Turn Canada into American State Backfired in the Past\nThe history of American whiskey, its rise to global prominence, and its status as a symbol of American identity are rooted in a unique confluence of factors. \nIn the early 20th century, prohibition crippled the whiskey industry. Many distillers shuttered and those that survived did so by producing medicinal whiskey or pivoting to other industries. At the end of Prohibition in 1933, whiskey distilling boomed in the U.S. as restrictions against mass production ended. Nonetheless, producers faced an uphill battle. Whiskey retained an association with criminality and drunkenness—one that whiskey makers were desperate to break.\nWorld War II again laid the industry low, as distilleries were repurposed to produce industrial alcohol for the war effort. As the war ended, it provided an unexpected boost to American whiskey production, albeit in two indirect ways.\nThe U.S. emerged as a dominant economic power, which led to rapid expansion of American industry, including whiskey production. Whiskey became a key export that followed the rise of American cultural and economic influence abroad. Additionally, the war introduced many American soldiers to whiskey, and as they returned home, they brought with them a taste for the spirit. \nThe postwar economic boom, coupled with rising disposable income and the expansion of consumer culture, fueled whiskey’s golden age in the 1950s and 1960s. As global markets adjusted to America's economic expansion in this period, whiskey remained a staple of U.S. exports. The Bourbon Institute, a trade society formed in 1958, fought to lower trade restriction on American whiskey abroad, eventually removing almost all trade barriers in Europe. \nThe increasing demand for American goods abroad meant that the spirit, once primarily a domestic product, became a key player in international trade in the 1950s and 1960s. The Bourbon Institute framed this growth explicitly in cultural terms. In 1960, its president William J. Marshall, proclaimed, “The bourbon industry feels that its product is a distinctively unique American product and that the sale of this product plays its part in the broader program of having American ways and products known throughout the world.” \nThis shift reinforced whiskey’s role as a symbol of American craftsmanship, while also tying it to the country’s broader economic influence on the world stage. Overseas, American advertising for whiskey retained the claims of Americana and frontier individualism that championed brands like Jack Daniels and Jim Beam as uniquely American even as they flooded foreign markets.\nHowever, despite this branding, the whiskey industry was not immune to changing consumer preferences. By the 1970s, a new generation of American drinkers increasingly turned to vodka and lighter spirits, seeing them as more modern and fashionable, than whiskey. Especially given the linkage between vodka and the USSR in Cold War imagery, the spirit became cooly subversive in a way whiskey couldn’t match. That left the whiskey industry, like so many other types of American manufacturers, to confront a period of decline, with sales dropping and many historic distilleries closing their doors. By the 1980s, fewer than 100 distilleries remained in operation in the U.S., a stark contrast to the postwar boom years.\nAs distilleries shuttered, it also sparked the consolidation of the industry. Over the ensuing decades, a handful of conglomerates came to dominate the American whiskey industry, acquiring smaller family-run distilleries at a rapid pace. Today, the spirit of individuality heralded in whiskey advertisements is not reflected in its production. By 2015, eight companies produced roughly 99% of all whiskey made in the U.S. \nRead More: Why Trump’s Threats to Canada Will Continue to Backfire\nIn fact, many of America’s most popular whiskey brands are currently owned by international conglomerates with enormous financial portfolios: Jim Beam (owned by the Japanese company Suntory Global Spirits), Bulleit (owned by the British company Diageo), and Wild Turkey (owned by the Italian company Campari Group) are but a few of the American-made brands currently part of a global network of capital.\nThis reality exposes how claims that whiskey is a uniquely American product—an industry rooted in the frontier, perseverance, and economic independence—are as much industry mythmaking as fact. The American whiskey industry has long been shaped by global forces, from the export and advertising of whiskey abroad to the increasing dominance of international conglomerates.\nThis history helps explain why Canadians have targeted American whiskey in their boycotts. Indeed, Bourbon, Tennessee Whiskey, and other American-made whiskeys come overwhelmingly from states that voted for Trump, especially Kentucky and Tennessee. Canadian politicians are leveraging this partisan divide. Last month, the Premier of British Columbia, David Eby directed British Columbia’s state-run liquor stores to stop purchasing American liquor from “red states.” \nCanadians want to target the heart of a movement that sees itself as being about American identity and they see no better means than by boycotting an industry that still markets itself as distinctly American. Even 60 years later, Bourbon distillers still trumpet a 1964 congressional resolution declaring their spirit “a distinctive product of the United States.” Writer Reid Mitenbuler recounts that American whiskey and bourbon distillers rely on “the values implied by the frontier iconography found on countless bourbon bottles [which] are inherently American: individualism, self-sufficiency, practicality, and guts.” \nAmerican whiskey relies on these claims of authenticity and tradition to sell the industry’s product. That may need to change for the industry to thrive at a moment when the U.S. is antagonizing many countries around the globe\nThis branding played a key role in elevating American whiskey around the globe in the post-war period when U.S. influence was burgeoning globally. Yet, the international marketplace that has shaped the whiskey industry for a century is susceptible to political forces. That means it isn’t immune to the consequences of geopolitical disputes and shifting consumer preferences worldwide. Today, as the Trump administration courts opprobrium abroad, the industry’s identity and branding leaves it uniquely exposed and vulnerable, as the Canadian boycott efforts spotlight. \nE.

Razer appears to still be selling its PC and console peripherals on the site, however.

In a Monday post on Truth Social, the President threatened an additional 50 percent tariff on goods imported from China in response to a retaliatory tariff from the Chinese government.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, President Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed that the additional tariff would take effect on Tuesday night, reaching a whopping 104 percent.\n“When America is punched, he punches back harder,” Leavitt said. “That’s why there will be 104 percent tariffs going into effect on China tonight at midnight.”\nFramework has paused sales of some of its laptops in response to the tariffs, and Micron has reportedly warned of tariff price hikes as well.\nMark has written for PCWorld for the last decade, with 30 years of experience covering technology.

The Ottoman Empire was in the 32nd year of Sultan Abdulhamid II’s rule. England was focused on pushing the German Empire, which it saw as its greatest threat and wanted to reach the oceans and establish itself in the colonies, to the continent and stopping its advance.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nEditor’s Note 4/9/2025: The Trump Administration “paused” worldwide tariffs on Wednesday, reducing them to 10 percent worldwide. As a result, Framework said that it is returning U.S. system prices to the original pre-tariff prices.  However, some prices (like the Framework Laptop 13 Professional pre-built configuration, are now higher: $1,649 versus $1,499 a day ago. “For our lowest-priced base systems, where we’re unable to absorb the remaining 10% tariff, ordering is still paused for US customers,” Framework said. \nFramework has decided to “temporarily pause” sales of certain low-end Framework 13 Laptops due to the new tariffs implemented by the Trump administration, the company said.\n“Due to the new tariffs that came into effect on April 5th, we’re temporarily pausing U.S. sales on a few base Framework Laptop 13 systems (Ultra 5 125H and Ryzen 5 7640U),” Framework said on Twitter/X. “For now, these models will be removed from our U.S. site. We will continue to provide updates as we have them.”\n404 Media reported that the models had in fact been removed from Framework’s web page, with models starting at $799.\nIn a followup post, Framework explained: “We priced our laptops when tariffs on imports from Taiwan were 0%. At a 10% tariff, we would have to sell the lowest-end SKUs at a loss. Other consumer goods makers have performed the same calculations and taken the same actions, though most have not been open about it.”\nWhat wasn’t clear, however, was why Framework didn’t simply raise its prices to compensate. Economists and trade organizations have predicted since last year that manufacturers would simply raise prices by the tariffed percentage, simply passing along costs to the consumer. Potential customers responding to the Twitter post wondered the same thing, but the company didn’t respond. However, the full effects of the various Trump tariffs (up to 54 percent on imports from China, aluminum imports, and semiconductors) are slowly being understood and may vary depending upon company and product. \nFramework doesn’t seem to have raised its pre-order prices as a result of the tariff, however. When the Framework Desktop was first announced, the base price was $1,099. Though Framework sold out of its first few batches, at press time the company had moved on to “Batch 9” — which will ship in the third quarter, well after any tariffs have taken effect. However, Framework is still charging $1,099 for the base model, as before, as of press time.\nMark Hachman / Foundry\nInstead, Framework is apparently in the process of re-adjusting its prices for its existing PCs. For example, Framework’s DIY edition of the Laptop 13 indicates that the cheapest version available is priced at $749. In reality, a Framework 13 with a AMD Ryzen 7640U (at $899) is the cheapest option available. The company’s prebuilt page also indicates that Framework is selling a prebuilt Framework Laptop 13 for $899, when in fact only the “Professional” version for $1,499 appears to be in stock.\nFramework representatives declined to comment further.\nMark has written for PCWorld for the last decade, with 30 years of experience covering technology.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nAnyone who owns a Roku streaming player is familiar with the Roku remote, the one with the four “shortcut” buttons in the bottom third of the device. \nThe buttons are marked with a revolving door of streaming service logos, from Netflix and Hulu to Max and Apple TV+. Press one of the buttons, and you’ll jump directly to that streaming service. \nThat’s great if you happen to be subscribed to those four particular streaming services, but if you’re not—and I’d wager most of us don’t subscribe to four streaming services at a time—you’re stuck with one or more useless buttons on your Roku remote. (And no, you can’t reprogram those buttons.) \nLuckily, the other big streaming device players don’t put shortcut buttons on their remotes… oh wait, they do. (The Siri remote that ships with an Apple TV doesn’t have them, or at least not yet.) \nThese TV remote shortcut buttons are nothing new, but now Google is upping the ante with a “Free TV” button for Google TV devices made by third parties (a story that was broken by Android Authority.) \nWe’ve already seen an example on Walmart’s Onn Google TV 4K Pro, which sports a big blue “Free TV” button right in the middle of the remote. Press it, and you’ll jump to Google “Freeplay” selection of live streaming channels, or to an equivalent live streaming guide in regions where Google doesn’t offer Freeplay. \nWhile only a few Google TV devices have a Free TV button at the moment, Google is now requiring its OEM partners to put a “Free TV” or “Live TV” button on their upcoming Google TV remotes, as Android Authority reports. (Google hasn’t revealed the mandated specifications for the button, including its size and color.) \nNow, if you happen to love these FAST (short for “free ad-supported TV”) channels, the “Free TV” button will come in handy. If not, you’ve got a big blue button on your remote that you’ll need to avoid. \nIt should be pointed out that unlike typical TV shortcut buttons, Google’s Free TV button can be reprogrammed, although doing so requires a third-party app. \nStill, it’s galling that TV and streaming media player manufacturers are sticking more and more of these shortcuts buttons on their remotes, and of course, it’s a practice that’s more focused on generating revenue than it serving the customer. (Google, for its part, told Android Authority that the button “will help provide a consistent experience with quick access at users’ fingertips.”) \nStreaming services pay the likes of Roku, Amazon, and Google for getting prime shortcut placement on their remotes, while the Google’s new Free TV buttons will help draw more eyeballs to its collection of FAST channels, which means more advertising dollars. \nFor most of us, these shortcut buttons are the opposite of convenience—they’re actively annoying, falling in the same bucket as TV screensaver advertisements and auto-playing video ads. \nOn the opposite end of the spectrum was Logitech’s line of Harmony universal remotes, which you could customize to your heart’s content. Sadly, Logitech discontinued its Harmony remotes years ago, and it recently nixed support for its oldest Harmoney models. \nSo yes, these streaming remote shortcut buttons are a collective pain, and we can expect more of them in the future.\nBen has been writing about technology and consumer electronics for more than 20 years.

Anyone can file a lese majeste complaint and sentences for those convicted can be decades long, with hundreds of people prosecuted in recent years.\n    \n\n            Chambers’ lawyer, Wannaphat Jenroumjit, said a warrant for his arrest was issued last week after a complaint was filed by a regional army command. Alongside lese majeste, Chambers is also facing charges under the Computer Crimes Act.\n    \n\n            “He was accused of publishing a blurb on (Singapore’s Institute of Southeast Asian Studies’) website in connection with an ISEAS webinar in October 2024 about military reshuffles,” said Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate, advocacy lead for Thai Lawyers for Human Rights and part of Chambers’ legal team.\n    \n\n            “He denied all charges. He neither wrote nor published the blurb on the website,” Akarachai said.\n    \n\n            Speaking ahead of Tuesday’s court appearance, Chambers told CNN he had been told little about why he was charged and feared he “could be imprisoned for 15 years.”\n    \n\n            Chambers was released on bail early Thursday after multiple bail requests were earlier denied. He is barred from leaving the country and Thai authorities have revoked his work visa.\n    \n\n            Chambers is a scholar, author and lecturer at Naresuan University’s Centre of ASEAN Community Studies, and frequently contributes insights to news articles on Southeast Asia, including to CNN.\n    \n\nRelated article\nThailand indicts former leader Thaksin Shinawatra on royal insult charges\n\n\n            Advocates say the charges pose “a grave threat to academic freedom in the country.”\n    \n\n            “Unlike other lese majeste cases, this case involves an extremely well-established academic whose work focuses very deeply on the civil-military relations in Thailand and whose expertise is widely acknowledged within the academic community,” Akarachai said.\n    \n\n            The US Department of State said on Tuesday it was “alarmed” by Chambers’ arrest and is providing consular assistance.\n    \n\n            “We are in communication with Thai authorities regarding this case,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a statement. “As a treaty ally of Thailand, we will closely monitor this issue and advocate for the fair treatment of Paul Chambers… We have requested access to him to ensure his well-being and to provide any necessary support.”\n    \n\n            Thailand’s conservative, military-backed establishment has ruled the country on and off for decades, and critics say it routinely uses laws like lese majeste, sedition, and the computer crimes act to silence criticism and opposition.\n    \n\n            The military has long had an outsized influence over the country’s politics, despite Thais repeatedly voting overwhelmingly in support of the military’s political and progressive opponents. It has staged 13 successful coups since absolute monarchy ended in 1932, the latest in 2014 that ushered in just under a decade of military or military-backed rule.\n    \n\n            Last year, a Thai appeal court extended a man’s prison sentence to a record 50 years for insulting the monarchy, in what is believed to be the toughest penalty ever imposed under the lese majeste law.\n    \n\n            The charges against Chambers represent a “tightening chokehold on free speech and academic freedom in Thailand,” said Sunai Phasuk, senior Thailand researcher for Human Rights Watch.\n    \n\n            “Paul is considered a major target by ultra-royalist groups, which have launched multiple attacks against him for years — ranging from online disinformation and hate campaigns to pressing authorities to revoke his visa and get him expulsed from the university,” Sunai told CNN.\n    \n\n            It is rare for a foreign national to be targeted by lese majeste. In 2011, Thai-born American Joe W. Gordon was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison for insulting the monarchy after posting a link to a biography of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, that he was involved in translating, which was banned in Thailand. He was later released after receiving a royal pardon.\n    \n\nRelated article\nYoung Thai activist’s death in detention after 65-day hunger strike sparks calls for justice reform\n\n\n            For years, human rights organizations and free speech campaigners have said the law has been used as a political tool to silence critics of the Thai government.\n    \n\n            And rights groups say the right to freedom of expression in Thailand has come under increased attack since 2020, when nationwide youth-led protests saw millions of young people take to the streets calling for constitutional and democratic reforms – for the first time openly criticizing the monarchy, and publicly questioning its power and wealth.\n    \n\n            Those protests came four years after King Maha Vajiralongkorn succeeded his father King Bhumibol, who had reigned for seven decades.\n    \n\n            Despite the change from a military-backed government to civilian leadership in 2023, surveillance and intimidation against activists and students continues, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights.\n    \n\n            The legal advocacy group said that since the start of those protests in July 2020 and up until the end of January 2025, at least 1,960 people have been prosecuted or charged for their participation in political assemblies and for speaking out, with at least 277 prosecuted for lese majeste.\n    \n\n            One of the most prominent of those is Arnon Nampa, a Thai activist with a cumulative sentence of 18 years in prison for a raft of lese majeste and other charges relating to his advocating for monarchy reform during the 2020 protests.\n    \n\n            A much-anticipated bill that would offer amnesty for those prosecuted in politically motivated cases will be introduced to Thailand’s parliament on Wednesday.  However, there is ongoing debate as to whether lese majeste will be included in the bill.\n    \n\n            The high-profile nature of Chambers’ case could mean it backfires on the military and have wider impacts on Thai society, some analysts say.\n    \n\n            “The cost to the Thai military is high because it will attract the kind of international attention and scrutiny the army wants to avoid,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University.\n    \n\n            “This case tightens the lid on academic freedom, and will reinforce the closing of Thai minds and undermine the intellectual and research ecosystem necessary to foster ideas and innovation to propel the Thai economy forward.”\n    \n\nCNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

It’s currently only $10 on Amazon with this 38% off limited-time deal, the lowest it’s ever been.\nThe Revodok 105 hub grants 100W of power delivery via USB-C, plus four other ports. That means you can keep your laptop charging while also being able to use your keyboard, mouse, headset, SSDs, flash drives, or whatever else you need to connect via the supplied dual USB-A 2.0 ports (up to 480Mbps data) and USB-A 3.0 port (up to 5Gbps data).\nThe best port, however, comes at the very end of the hub: a full-sized HDMI connection that supports up to 4K@30Hz. That’s perfect for a productivity setup so you can splay out your spreadsheets and documents on screen, and also great for streaming high-res video, but not so great for gaming (unless you’re content with 30 FPS).\nWith its narrow form, this USB-C hub can easily be thrown into your bag without worrying about it taking up space. It’s hard to get a hub like this for this cheap, so jump on the Revodok for $10 while you can!\nGabriela has focused on tech writing for 12 years, covering news, reviews, buying guides, deals, and more.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nMini PCs are great when you’re on a budget and need the best price-performance ratio you can get, but you can also pay up a little bit more for a mini PC that packs excellent power—like this Minisforum UM890 Pro model with beastly specs that’s now 20% off on Amazon. That brings its price down from $910 to $730, its all-time best price.\nWhat makes this mini PC such a monster in its class? Start with the AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS processor on board and 64GB of DDR5 RAM. Yes, you read that right! This tiny thing is loaded with tons of memory, way more than you need to smoothly run Windows 11 Pro (included) along with all your apps, browser tabs, games, and more.\nThe UM890 Pro is essentially a compact desktop rocket that’ll help you complete just about any task you need, from your daily workload to image editing to other demanding activities. It doesn’t hurt that there’s a 1TB SSD on board for storing all your apps, games, videos, and more, while fast enough to boot up the system in a blink.\nIf there’s a downside here, it’s the lack of a dedicated graphics card. However, the integrated AMD Radeon 780M is one of the most powerful integrated GPUs for desktops, and it’s good enough to run modern 3D games on decent settings at playable frame rates. If you aren’t a hardcore gamer and if you keep your expectations in check, this config will serve you well—and it’s a fantastic value for the price.\nAnd even if you don’t game at all, that graphical power will come in handy for multitasking productivity because the UM890 Pro can support up to quadruple 4K@60Hz displays or double 8K@60Hz via its ports: 2x USB4, 1x DisplayPort, and 1x full-sized HDMI. Other ports include 4x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, 1x 2.5Gbps Ethernet, 1x headphone/mic, and 1x OCuLink for connecting external PCIe devices.\nThat’s a ton of power for the price, so if you’ve been looking to upgrade your home office PC setup, save space with this tiny-yet-performant Minisforum UM890 Pro for under $740 on Amazon.\nGabriela has focused on tech writing for 12 years, covering news, reviews, buying guides, deals, and more.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nAn AI-powered smart home voice assistant that amiably chats with you, follows your orders with ease, and does your bidding in the background? It’s a tantalizing idea that seems so close, yet remains stubbornly far away. \nThe big prediction last year was that a new Apple smart hub powered by an AI-augmented Siri would arrive by spring 2025—right around now—complete with a touchscreen and smart home controls. It was a device that would vault Apple back into the smart home game. \nAnd then there was Google, which had begun testing Gemini on its Nest smart speakers late last year, allowing a small subset of its users to chat with the powerful AI model when asking more complex questions. \nMaking the biggest splash of all was Amazon, which blew everyone away (myself included) with its AI-revamped Alexa during a late-February event in New York. With none other than Panos Panay chatting away with the far more loquacious Alexa+, followed by live demos of the assistant ably fielding natural-language smart home commands, a new era of AI-powered smart home control seemed just within reach. \nAnd yet, while AI keeps tiptoeing toward the smart home, it never seems to jump right in, as it has—quite disruptively—in such fields as coding and illustration. \nThe (unannounced) Apple smart hub backed by an AI-infused Siri still isn’t here, and now we’re getting word that it may have been pushed back to 2026—not a total shock, given Apple’s reported issues with Apple Intelligence. \nMeanwhile, Google still seems very much in the preview stage with Gemini in the smart home. Yes, there’s an integration for the Gemini app that allows for limited smart home control, and there’s been some light chatter from Google Home preview users who’ve been wrestling with Gemini on their smart speakers. But aside from AI descriptions of events in Nest Cam video histories, the overall Google Home experience doesn’t feel all that different than it did 12 or even 24 months ago. \nAnd while Amazon seems closest of all to launching a state-of-the-art AI voice assistant, Alexa+ still isn’t widely available. The company confirmed that a small number of users got access to the revamped AI Alexa early last week, but the lucky few have been noticeably quiet, while The Washington Post reports that many of Alexa+’s most eye-catching features still aren’t ready for prime time. \nWhy is AI moving at a snail’s pace in smart homes while taking the rest of the world by storm? The reason is simple: What makes generative AI models so creative inside a chatbox could wreak havoc—or at least, major inconvenience—when unleashed on smart devices.  \nGetting an LLM to integrate reliably with smart gadgets isn’t as easy as it sounds, and while AI is less likely to throw a “Sorry, I didn’t understand that” error when chatting with users, it’s more likely to guess—and guess wrong—in an attempt to please you. It’s one thing for an AI to goof in a chatbox, but quite another when it comes to controlling your smart locks. \nOf course, there’s nothing like competition to break a logjam, and if Alexa+ does make a successful debut within the next several weeks, the AI smart home may finally begin heating up. \nBut if the new Alexa stumbles out of the gate, the wait for AI in the smart home is only going to get longer. \nBen has been writing about technology and consumer electronics for more than 20 years.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nIf you don’t keep Teams updated on your computer, Microsoft will block your access to the communication app, Neowin reports.\nWhen Microsoft releases a new version of the Teams app, you have 90 days to install the update or you’ll start seeing a “blocking page” that requires you to install the update before you can resume using the app. Teams will start sending you recurring update reminders at the 30-day mark. If you don’t want to update, you can switch to the web app.\nMicrosoft explains that the reason for the block is to ensure that all users stay safe with the latest security updates and compliance measures. The company first made this announcement back in November 2024, with a message posted to the Microsoft 365 Message Center:\n“Keeping Microsoft Teams up to date is critical to ensure your devices are secure and compliant. By default, and as designed, Teams updates automatically which successfully updates most clients in the world without additional overhead for customers.\nMicrosoft Teams is governed by the Modern Lifecycle Policy which requires that the Teams desktop client be kept up to date. […] As documented, when a client falls out of date, the user will see:\nAs an example, if the Teams app is hypothetically on a version released on January 1 and the next update is fully available on January 15, an in-app alert would be shown on February 14th (30 days after the January 15th update).”\nA more recent message gave specific dates for when you’ll start seeing the blocking page in Teams. If you’re on the Windows desktop app, you’ll start seeing it on April 11, 2025. For Teams in a VDI environment, the start date is May 6, 2025. For the macOS app, it’ll start on May 15, 2025.\nThis article originally appeared on our sister publication PC för Alla and was translated and localized from Swedish.\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters"}

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nIf your phone and/or laptop constantly throws “low battery” tantrums, and if you’re always worried about running out of juice, then you need a power bank—especially if you travel for long stretches, frequently go on camping trips, or just use your devices all the time.\nAnd if you need a power bank, then today’s your lucky day. This Baseus EnerGeek G12 model is only $45 on Amazon after applying the JSL7VMNK promo code on top of the current sale price. That comes out to a whopping 50% discount, and it only released two months ago!\nThe Baseus EnerGeek GR12 has a huge 20,800mAh capacity, which is plenty for pretty much any laptop you could possibly own. That’s enough to fully recharge a MacBook Air M3 Pro or Steam Deck, or over three full recharges for an iPhone 16 Pro. Get super-fast charging via either of the two 100W USB-C ports, but you’ll need a high-speed USB-C cable capable of such throughput.\nThere are actually four ports available on this power bank—the aforementioned two fast-charging USB-C ports as well as an additional two USB-A ports. This means you can charge multiple devices at once, but note that this thing can provide a max 145W of charging power that gets split up if multiple ports are in use at once.\nThis Baseus power bank has a 65W input for recharging itself, so it can go from 0% to 100% in about 2 hours. It also supports pass-through charging, so if you’re at home and want to recharge your devices while recharging the power bank, you can.\nIt’s an amazing power bank, especially when you can get it for this cheap. With promo code JSL7VMNK at checkout, the newly released Baseus EnerGeek GR12 is now just $45 on Amazon. Snag it soon because this awesome deal isn’t going to last forever.\nGabriela has focused on tech writing for 12 years, covering news, reviews, buying guides, deals, and more.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nIt’s hard to find a good laptop for under $500 these days, at least if you want one that can run Windows 11 and Chrome at the same time without choking. If you’re on a tight budget and hunting for a new machine, check out this Acer laptop on eBay. With a refurb model and a 20 percent off coupon, you can get it for just $389.99.\nThe Acer Aspire 16 is pretty middle-of-the-road in terms of hardware and capability, but it has a 10-core Intel Core 5 120U processor (just one year old) and 16GB of RAM. That’s enough to handle most daily tasks with ease, including browsing a ton of tabs, online streaming video, and even some light gaming.\nAnd while a 16-inch 1200p display isn’t exactly amazing, it should be more than good enough for work and media duties. The 512GB storage space could be larger, but again, it should suffice unless you need to handle tons of high-res photos and videos on the regular.\nThis is a refurbished model, but it’s being sold directly from Acer’s eBay store (shipping from Texas) and comes with a two-year warranty for peace of mind. The extra 20 percent off code, OUTLET20, should be good until April 14th. But given how affordable this deal is—about half the original retail price—the stock might not hold up that long.\nFor more laptop buying advice see our articles on all the best laptop deals and the best laptops we’ve tested.\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nAre you ready to completely overhaul your floor cleaning routines? The eufy E28 and E25 have just landed, and we bet you’re going to want one of these robotic cleaners delivered to your home sooner rather than later. Under pre-sale now, be sure to order and save your spot in line with these powerful units.\nThe E25 and E28 are two brand-new models unveiled by the company. Both feature eufy’s award-winning HydroJet mopping technology and deliver a jaw-dropping 20,000Pa suction power for a deep clean.\nThe E28 isn’t like other robotic vacuum cleaners with mopping capabilities and a self-cleaning base: this is the world’s first robotic cleaning system to feature a detachable portable deep cleaner that can handle carpet stains, and clean stairs and sofas. It’s an all-in-one cleaning solution that–if you have kids or pets–your house will thank you for.\neufy\neufy’s patented FlexiOne technology allows a detachable motor to power various elements of the E28. This makes it possible for the base station water tank to be removed and used as a portable deep cleaner for furniture, stairs, carpets, and pretty much anything else that needs a deep clean, including your car seats.\nYou simply disconnect the water tank, carry it to the spot that needs cleaning, unwind the hose, and just clean whatever spot needs attention. The eufy E28 could potentially save you big bucks that you might otherwise have to spend on an upholstery cleaner, not to mention the space you’ll save for storage.\nIt’s this portable deep-cleaning function that separates the E28 and E25. Both are powerful, all-in-one robotic vacuum and mop systems–but if you don’t have a need for a portable deep cleaner (perhaps your home is all hard flooring), the E25 is one of the most powerful robotic vacuum and mopping systems on its own.\neufy\nWith 20,000Pa Turbo suction, the new eufy robots can lift dust, pet hair, food crumbs, and whatever else is on your floors, carpets, or rugs. Using DuoSpiral brushes, which prevent hair from becoming entangled (a frustrating problem with many alternatives), these robot cleaners make quick work of your floors.\nThe eufy E25 and E28 also feature an extending CornerRover arm that can reach into tight corners and edges, making sure all areas are thoroughly vacuumed.\nWhen it comes to mopping, the eufy E25 and E28 take things up a notch. Instead of relying on a moving pad or rotating round mops, these robot vacuums have a rolling mop. The HydroJet system ensures the rolling mop is continuously washed as it moves over your floors, scraping away dirty water and replenishing the roller with clean water and cleaning solution. The rolling mop doesn’t just glide over the floors, it applies 1.5kg (over 3 pounds!) of downward pressure–your floors will be as clean as if you had hand-scrubbed them.\neufy includes an Omni docking station that does all the maintenance work for you. The robot self-empties when it returns to the base, and the station then washes the mop, dries it with hot air, automatically adds detergent, collects the waste water, and refills the robot’s water tank.\nYou can also pair the eufy E25 and E28 with Alexa, Siri, or Google Home, which will allow you to control the robot with your voice.\nBoth the eufy E28 and E25 are available for pre-sale at eufy’s website. The E28 is available for $1,299, while the E25 is $999. eufy’s E28 will be available from April 23, while the E25 is scheduled to arrive in June.\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters"}

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nShort of joining the 5am club (I’m really not a morning person), I’ve been looking for ways to streamline my workflow, and I’m happy to say I’ve finally found one: side-mounting my phone to my laptop.\nBefore you use one of those dubious sideways glance emojis and click off onto the next story, please hear me out. It really does make a big difference to my workday, I swear.\nFirst and foremost, side-mounting my phone helps boost my productivity. With my phone side-mounted to my PC I can receive and make phone calls hands-free, read my incoming texts and notifications with just a flick, and more easily keep an eye on apps like X (formerly twitter) for news stories as they’re breaking, without the cumbersome process of finding and picking up my phone off my desk, or alternatively finding the right tabs on my laptop.\nUsing my phone like this I can also more easily multi-task. For example, I can keep writing the stories I’m working on for PCWorld, while I’m simultaneously in a Teams call or product briefing where I’m not expected to contribute anything but just listen, so it’s a real time saver, too.\nSide-mounting my phone to my laptop also helps keep me on point. Since my phone remains at eye-level, I’m less prone to losing my train of thought like I previously was when I had to scramble around for my phone, then regain my attention, reposition my hands on my keyboard, and find the place where I left off in my work — now I simply have to look to the right side of my laptop screen for whatever I need my phone for.\nBut the best thing about my new setup? I can now use my phone as a second screen. This comes in very handy when I need to compare and contrast hardware specs in stories. Plus, my second display isn’t limited to being with me just at my desk in the office — it can be used wherever I happen to be working from.\nThere are a range of different phone side mounts available, for which you can expect to pay about $13 to $15. Some of the best are universally compatible with all cellphone types and magnetic. That makes them so easy to set up, you simply have to mount your phone on the end of a magnetic arm that you then attach to the back of your laptop.\nIt’s worth noting, though, that with some iPhones older than iPhone 12 and all Android phones you will need a magnetic case, magnetic ring, or magnetic adapter if you want your phone to stick to the magnetic arm.\nThe holder’s arm usually comes adjustable so that you can position your phone exactly where you want it for maximum efficiency — yes, those accessory suppliers have thought of everything.\nSo, if you’re like me and don’t do early mornings well without at least a jug of coffee but you still want to kick-start your workflow, my advice is to ditch the 5am wakeups and get yourself a phone side-mount instead. Trust me, you won’t regret it.\nBased in Australia, Dominic Bayley is a hardcore tech enthusiast.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nHeatsinks are the unsung heroes of cooling down your PC, as they prevent overheating by transferring heat away from important components. The CPU and GPU can generate a lot of heat, especially when running heavier loads. If those components grow too hot, they can slow down and malfunction, which can negatively impact performance. The heatsink, which is typically made of aluminum or copper, consists of a flat base that’s placed directly on top of these heat generating components. Above this base are fins or pins that provide a large surface area for heat dissipation.\nAn NVMe SSD can also benefit from an additional heatsink. This is because high-performance flash drives in particular can heat up quickly.\nIcy Box \nHeatsinks are designed to absorb and release heat. The cold, flat surface of the heatsink is in direct contact with the hot component, which then allows heat to transfer from the hot surface to the cooler heatsink. The absorbed heat is then sent to the fins, where it is released into the air via convection. Fans are usually attached to the heatsink, which helps speed up the cooling process.\nThere are different types of heatsinks, each suited to different cooling needs. Passive heatsinks, for example, do not require fans because they rely on natural air circulation. This type of heatsink is more common in energy-efficient devices like ultrabooks. Active heatsinks, on the other hand, use fans to help dissipate the heat. This type is the most common. You’ve also got hybrid heatsinks, which use a combination of passive and active cooling. The fans on these types of systems will only activate when heat rises to a certain level.\nWithout a heatsink, the processor would likely overheat and cause your PC to shut down. In the worst case scenario, the heat could even cause permanent damage to the internal components. That’s why it is crucial that the heatsink is properly installed and functioning as it should. Other issues such as poor installation, dust-clogged fan, or old thermal paste can lead to overheating problems and system crashes.\nHeat sinks – like this one from Okat – use basic physics: thanks to conductive materials such as aluminum and copper, they absorb waste heat and release it into the air.\nOkat \nInstalling a heatsink is typically a straightforward process. You’ll need the right model for your CPU, some thermal paste, and a screwdriver. Apply a small amount of thermal paste to the previously cleaned surface of the processor and place the heat sink on the processor.\nNext, secure the heatsink with the appropriate screws or clips. Once in place, attach the fan cable to the CPU FAN connection on the motherboard. In addition to the CPU and GPU, other components can also benefit from a heatsink.\nNVMe SSDs in M.2 format can run better with additional cooling. You should also pay attention to the exhaust fans and air circulation in the computer housing, which, in combination with the heatsink, ensure optimum heat dissipation.\nThis article originally appeared on our sister publication PC-WELT and was translated and localized from German.\n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters"}

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nIn the mid-1990s, Microsoft DOS dominated most PCs. Those who were a step ahead might’ve been using Windows 3.1, but even that was a superimposed user interface on top of MS-DOS. Windows was still pretty darn unfamiliar to people back then, so in 1995, Microsoft came up with a more user-friendly interface called Microsoft Bob (codename Utopia).\nBob was a complete replacement for Windows 3.1, changing the way users interacted with their PCs. Instead of “windows,” you interfaced with a digital house with all files, folders, and features represented as parts of the house. For example, there was a room for mail and one for the calendar, plus furniture and animated characters (like the dog Rover), all in a welcoming cartoony look. The intent was to lower the usability barriers for PC beginners and make computers easier to navigate.\nHowever, user enthusiasm was limited and critical reception was poor. Hardly anyone bought Bob—only about 30,000 copies were sold—and it made high demands on the hardware, requiring 8MB of RAM, which was a lot in 1995. Microsoft discontinued Bob about a year later, around the time Windows 95 came out, but that wasn’t the end for Bob.\nWith Windows XP’s release in 2001, the failed Microsoft Bob made a curious comeback. When Microsoft put Windows XP on installation CDs, they discovered that there were still 30 MB free on those discs—so Microsoft decided to fill up that space. With what, you ask? With an encrypted form of Bob, of course!\nFormer Microsoft employee and Windows developer Raymond Chen explained the reasoning in a 2008 issue of TechNet Magazine:\n“The result was a rather feeble attempt to slow down the people who like to make illegal copies of Windows. Somebody decided to fill that extra capacity on the CD with dummy data and to have the Windows Setup program verify that the dummy data was still there. This, the logic went, would force people downloading a copy of the CD image to download an additional thirty or so megabytes of data. Remember, this was back in the day when ‘broadband’ hadn’t yet become a household word and mainstream users were using dial-up connections. Having to transfer an additional thirty megabytes of data over a 56Kb modem was a bit of an obstacle to slow users down—not that it would slow them down much by today’s standards.”\nBut why Bob’s code of all things? Chen continues:\n“The person who was asked to implement this check needed a source for the dummy data. Now, he could have just called the CryptGenRandom function to generate 30 megabytes of cryptographically random bytes, but where’s the fun in that? Instead, he dug through the archives and found a copy of Microsoft Bob. He took all the floppy disk images and combined them into one big file. The contents of the Microsoft Bob floppy disk images are not particularly random, so he decided to scramble up the data by encrypting it. When it came time to enter the encryption key, he just smashed his hand haphazardly across the keyboard and out came an encrypted copy of Microsoft Bob. That’s what went into the unused space as ballast data on the Windows XP CD.”\nAnd so, everyone who bought Windows XP also (unknowingly) received a copy of the totally flopped Microsoft Bob.\nIt’s kind of funny in the grand scheme, considering we once named Microsoft Bob as one of the worst tech products of all time. Still, little Easter eggs like this are expected and unavoidable when you have a history as extensively storied as Microsoft does.\nThis article originally appeared on our sister publication PC-WELT and was translated and localized from German.\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters"}

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nI’ve gone on the record before as being in favor of graphics cards themed after—if not necessarily covered in—anime waifus, to say nothing of motherboards themed after delightful cartoon cats. We deserve variety in our desktop components, is what I’m saying here. And it turns out that Zotac wants to deliver said variety with its latest RTX 5070. The only downside is that, for many reasons, I’ll never get to clap eyes on it.\nThis X-Gaming variant (spotted by VideoCardz) is made as a bit of licensed merch for JX Online 3, an MMO that’s hugely popular in China even after nearly a decade. But more relevant to me is that it actually has some color aside from black, white, and brushed metal. The main shroud has a pleasant pink-to-teal gradient going on that reminds me of that one disposable cup pattern from the 90s, you know the one. There’s also perhaps a bit of 90s tribal tattoo thrown in. But maybe that’s iconography from the game? I wouldn’t know since it’s only available in China (and that’s what we call foreshadowing).\nZotac\nAdmittedly, the whole package is let down by the back of the graphics card, which is a printed plate filled with characters from the game in a very “get them all onto the same Photoshop canvas” sort of way. Even if you insist on getting images from the game in there, it could be done with a little more elegance, maybe by focusing on just one and going with their colors. Another Zotac design—this one apparently also JX Online 3-themed—is a bit more subtle, though not as eye-catching.\nBut as I said before, it hardly matters. Neither this spiffy-looking game tie-in nor the non-licensed regular X-Gaming version of the 5070 with a similar front shroud are showing up on the US version of the Zotac site. And your only other options for a unique-looking RTX 50-series card might be disqualified due to personal budget… or taste.

Our enemy is Europe!\"\nOlder accounts associated with the propaganda campaign previously supported independent far right Romanian politician and conspiracy theorist Călin Georgescu, who ran for the office of Romanian president in 2024, before the elections were cancelled due to allegations of Russian interference.\nAccounts associated with the campaign which have been created more recently appear to have quickly gained new followers with the intention of propagating similar themes.\nSome of the posts have even suggested that Vladimir Putin would be welcomed as the leader of Romania.\nFor instance, in the following social media post, Vladimir Putin is \"quoted\" describing Romania as \"a dictatorial state that follows the orders of the European Union.\"\nThe quote ends by \"Putin\" saying that he \"will have to release\" the people of Romania.\nAnother message on the same account said: \"How does Romania not love me? I opened an account in a day and I jumped 10,000 followers!\"\nOther observers have posted on Facebook evidence of how propaganda has been posted by thousands of accounts on Telegram groups in the form of comments claiming \"Romanians are the servants of the Europeans, the EU is stealing our wealth, the authorities are against the people, Romanians must wake up and stop being cowards...\"\nIronically, some of the comments have been accidentally left in Russian rather than properly translated into Romanian.\nOver 27,000 fake accounts used during Georgescu's election campaign have been identified and reported to TikTok. The Chinese company recently reported to the European Commission that it has removed a number of covert influence operations that attempted to manipulate discourse about the Romanian election.\ntags\nGraham Cluley is an award-winning security blogger, researcher and public speaker.

Here’s how it works.\n\nI'm happy to report that Instax has finally started making BEAUTIFUL instant cameras, and I absolutely love them. The latest addition to the Instax family is the new Instax Mini 41, replacing my favourite Instax camera - the Mini 40 - with an updated textured design and close-up mode with parallax correction.\nIt's no secret that I despised the bubblegum pop aesthetic of Instax's older Mini 11 and Mini 12 camera models, and it only got slightly better with the Instax Wide 400 which sports a camo green casing, yet still looks like a kid's camera. And let's not even talk about the Instax Pal released back in 2023, which I thought was the ugliest camera Instax has ever made (I still think it looks like Mike Wasowski). \nThankfully, those days of ugly instant camera designs from Fujifilm seem to be behind us (has Instax been reading my articles?) and we've entered a new era of stunning cameras that are elegant, sleek, modern, and most importantly - dark. There's nothing wrong with a bit of colour, of course. But in the age of professional cameras, I think there's nothing more classy than an all-black design, especially for weddings and events. Take a look at my picks of the best Instax film designs for creative pros.\n\nEven though I own one of the best camera phones, which as a photographer is very important to me, there's something so special about the analogue element of instant cameras, and holding the physical photo in your hands. It takes me away from the digital side of photography for a brief moment and you can't put a price on that, as cheesy as it sounds.\nThis dark camera trend from Instax seems to be at least a year in the making and kicked off with the launch of the Instax Mini 99 instant camera in March 2024. I love everything about this camera, especially its design, plus the advanced features that blend the best aspects of instant cameras with digital photography.\nBack in February, Instax also released its new Instax WIDE Evo model, which is a strikingly beautiful black hybrid instant camera, that combines digital processing with the instant experience that we all love. I got very excited when I had the opportunity to hold the WIDE Evo in my hands on a recent visit to Birmingham, and I honestly believe the two-tone monochrome design makes all the difference.\n\nThis model is a lot more premium than the Mini 41 announced today, and I can't quite justify the price ( $349.95 / £319.99) right now to warrant adding it to my instant camera collection, as much as I want to. But with that said, the new Instax Mini 41 is priced at a much more reasonable $99.99 / £94.99, which could definitely sway me towards buying it next payday.\nDaily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.\nI really hope that Instax continues making modern and innovative instant cameras with tech upgrades, but most of all, I beg that it doesn't revert back to its old aesthetic.

As of 2023, beauty is the third most popular category among global Instagram influencers, only after music and lifestyle. The ever-growing cosmetics industry valued at 758.4 billion U.S. dollars by 2025—higher than the GDP of Belgium, which is ranked 23rd of the major economies—is evidence that we do care about beauty.\nWith all these beautification methods available to us, have you ever wondered if your beauty is something that you can really improve, or is it something you are born with?\nThere is research that shows that, just like personality, intelligence, or morality, people also seem to hold different lay beliefs and mindsets about beauty—some believe that beauty is fixed and cannot be changed, whereas others may believe that beauty is malleable and can be improved with effort.\nIn our previous work, we have seen that these mindsets about beauty can affect consumers' cosmetic consumption. But we got even more curious—given the pervasive roles that beauty has in many areas of our lives, will the influences of these beauty mindsets extend to other domains beyond beauty?\nIn a recent study, we found that a growth mindset of beauty (i.e., believing that beauty can be improved) will lead people to take more risks.\nTo explore how mindsets of beauty influence risk-taking behaviors, we conducted a series of experiments among more than 4,000 participants in different countries. The work is published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.\nWe found that people who believed that beauty is improvable took greater risks than others who believed that beauty is fixed.\nFor instance, they were more likely to take financial risks (e.g., more likely to favor \"a 20% chance of winning $800 and 80% chance of winning nothing\" over \"an 80% chance of winning $200 and a 20% chance of winning nothing\" in a decision-making scenario) or physical risks (e.g., likely to engage in hiking a potentially unsafe trail or going down a potentially dangerous ski slope).\nWe observed that risk-taking increases as the result of heightened optimism. Specifically, believing beauty can be improved produces the optimistic feelings that one will achieve positive outcomes in many domains of life.\nThis happens because beauty is thought to have a broad impact in various areas, more so than other human attributes such as intelligence or morality. Indeed, given the known benefits of being beautiful– such that beautiful people are seen as more trustworthy, more competent, and have better social skills—there seems to be an expectation that attractive people should achieve more desirable life outcomes.\nIf you tend to believe that beauty is malleable and can be changed, the next time you are about to make a decision that may involve some degree of risk, be sure to pause and think about how these beliefs may affect your decisions.\nYou may feel optimistic that positive outcomes will happen in many areas of your life, but it is important to consider your choices carefully and rationally to avoid any unrealistic optimism.\nThis story is part of Science X Dialog, where researchers can report findings from their published research articles.

That case has sparked a slew of requests from international students to have their names removed from articles about the pro-Palestinian protest movement, according to the Student Press Law Center, a legal nonprofit dedicated to supporting student journalists’ rights. The center is advising student journalists to seriously consider those requests. \nThe SPLC and five other organizations that advocate for student media released an advisory Friday guiding student journalists through some of the considerations they might make when deciding whether to take down an article or remove a name. \nUltimately, the advisory noted that one of the tenets of ethical journalism is to minimize harm: “We have issued this alert because our organizations believe student media may fail that obligation if they continue to adhere to the traditional guidelines in light of recent developments. [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] has weaponized lawful speech and digital footprints and has forced us all to reconsider long-standing journalism norms.” \nMike Hiestand, senior legal counsel for the SPLC, monitors the organization’s free legal hotline, which both high school and college student journalists can call with questions about their legal rights. The line received 39 percent more calls this March than it had in March 2024; the majority of them focused on how to respond to these requests. \nThere’s not a one-size-fits-all answer, Hiestand said, but it’s much more acceptable to be permissive with these requests than it would have been just a few months ago. \n“Our traditional advice … with takedown requests is that you tread carefully. Go slowly. Student media, just like all news media, is the first draft of history, and we take that responsibility importantly. You don’t want to go back in and start willy-nilly messing with history,” said Hiestand. “But the rules have changed.” \nMadeline Douglas, the editor-in-chief of Bwog, an independent student news organization at Columbia University, which has been at the forefront of President Donald Trump’s crusade against higher education, said the publication has received a handful of requests in recent weeks from students who want their names removed from articles. So far, Bwog has agreed to do so, removing both names and identifying information like year and major, and adding an editor’s note to the article to mark the change. \nBwog already had policies in place to protect student privacy, Douglas said, like a policy to blur faces in photographs, something many protesters began requesting in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, out of fear that the government would use said images to find protesters and charge them with crimes. But few newspapers actually implemented such policies.\nDouglas said it might not be best journalistic practice to remove the names of sources from stories, but doing so aligns with her philosophy as Bwog’s top editor.\n“Ultimately, the way I’m leading the publication, at least, and the way my board is leading it is, we understand that we are student journalists, and our duty first and foremost is to the students of our campus,” she said. \nSome reporters for Bwog have also begun requesting that their bylines be left off of articles covering controversial topics. Those stories instead carry the byline of “Bwog staff.” \n“From the people I’ve talked to, it’s been very much, ‘I’m ready to write this, I want to write this, but for my safety, for my family’s safety, I don’t want anything retaliatory,’” she said. “Which, if we’re writing factual news, that shouldn’t be an issue, but with the current political climate right now, I do completely understand why people are nervous and are afraid.” \nThe Guardian reported that another Columbia publication, Columbia Political Review, has taken down entire articles and paused the publication of others. A student newspaper editor at Stanford University’s Stanford Daily told The Guardian that the newspaper was receiving a slew of takedown requests, and an editor who is an international student quit their job at the paper entirely.\nDespite the uncertainty and fear some student journalists are feeling, others say that attacks on campus free speech are making them more enthusiastic about the role student journalism can play in documenting such a historic time at America’s colleges and universities. \n“As a Board, we recognize the responsibility The Student bears as the sole newspaper on campus,” the editorial board of The Amherst Student, Amherst College’s student paper, wrote in an editorial last week. “The Trump administration’s blatant ignorance of the law cannot be ignored. We cannot capitulate to tyranny, and we stand in solidarity with those who have been silenced. We recognize how critical it is for us to deliver reliable, accurate information and offer diverse perspectives about issues pertaining to the college.” \nEric Thomas, a journalism professor at the University of Kansas who teaches an introductory journalism course, said the attacks on free speech have even encouraged some students to pursue journalism.\n“In this culture of nervousness about free speech, that’s why they’ve come to journalism,” he said. “They want to be the antidotes to that, and they want to say things other students are too nervous to even talk about.” \nA handful of student papers have called upon their institutions’ international students to make their voices heard, stressing the importance of sharing their stories amid attacks on immigrants and promising to protect them to the best of their ability if they do publish work in the paper’s pages. \n“We are committed to supporting students in expressing their beliefs through Student Life,” the staff of Washington University in St. Louis’s paper, The Student Life, wrote in a recent article. “We acknowledge the very real threat to the safety of immigrant students under the Trump administration, which has prided itself on its no-tolerance immigration policies. We are committed to providing guidance and working with vulnerable students who wish to write for the Forum section, to ensure their well-being and protection as best as we are able.”\nAfter years of financial struggles, the Oklahoma institution, which serves a majority Native American population, has\nThe government escalates its war with the university by withdrawing permission to host international students, who ma\nMichelle Deutchman, who leads UC’s free expression center, says institutions are grappling with how to promote studen\nAn interdisciplinary course at the University of Southern California teaches engineering students research skills and\nSee how adopting a credit applicability mindset is a win-win for student success and your institution’s bottom line.\nSubscribe for free to Inside Higher Ed’s newsletters, featuring the latest news, opinion and great new careers in higher education — delivered to your inbox.\nView Newsletters\nCopyright © 2025 Inside Higher Ed  All rights reserved. | Website designed by nclud\n\n4/5 Articles remainingthis month.\n"}

The Texas Tribune. Time magazine. The Washington Post.\nDozens of America’s most well-known newsrooms are experimenting with chatbots to help readers pick restaurants, learn more about political candidates and dive deeper into articles. But new research from Poynter and the University of Minnesota shows people may not be ready for it.\nNearly half of Americans say they don’t want news from generative artificial intelligence, according to a wide-ranging study from Poynter and the University of Minnesota on how audiences feel about AI. Twenty percent of people say publishers shouldn’t use AI at all.\nBenjamin Toff, associate professor at the Hubbard School of Journalism and director of the Minnesota Journalism Center, presented research at the second Summit on AI, Ethics and Journalism, led by Poynter and The Associated Press in New York City last week.\n“The data suggests if you build it, do not expect overwhelming demand for it,” said Toff, who has been studying news audiences — and avoiders — for nearly a decade.\n[Click here to check out the data referenced in this article, which was presented exclusively to news leaders at the Poynter and AP Summit on AI, Ethics and Journalism. When using the research, please cite Poynter and the University of Minnesota and link to this story.]\nThe research builds on a series of focus groups Toff led last year.\nData journalist Meredith Broussard, associate professor at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute of New York University and author of “More Than a Glitch: Confronting Race, Gender, and Ability Bias in Tech”, was more direct during her keynote speech at the summit.\n“Anybody really like using a chatbot? No. I can’t stand it. So, guess what? Your users feel like that, too,” she said. “They’re not excited about interacting with a chatbot on your site.”\n\nStill, surveying audiences about chatbots is tricky, as most people haven’t actually experienced a news-based AI product — just customer service bots. And data from the study show that most people aren’t using generative AI as much as the researchers thought.\nBut there’s still value in journalists experimenting with technology, which is encroaching further into our digital lives every day. Hearst has been at the forefront of chatbot experimentation, with its restaurant-recommending Chowbot debuting in early 2024.\n“We are basing this off of 30 years of high-quality reporting, high-quality editing, that Google might push to the side or not value in their model,” said Ryan Serpico, deputy director of newsroom AI and automation at Hearst Newspapers, of the value of trying to compete with Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude and other massive AI companies.\n“We need to be experimenting with more formats of information delivery,” said Christina Bruno, digital growth strategist at Spotlight PA. “I think chatbots are one way of doing that.”\nFrom left, Garance Burke, of The Associated Press; Lam Thuy Vo, of Documented; Phoebe Connelly, of The Washington Post; and Nikita Roy, of the “Newsroom Robots” podcast, discuss how to be an ethical leader of AI initiatives. (Courtesy: Keith Hughes)\nAudience-facing AI platforms are more well-received and impactful abroad, according to Nikita Roy, founder of the “Newsroom Robots” podcast and Knight Fellow at the International Center for Journalists.\nAn EU election chatbot developed by Swedish publisher Aftonbladet answered more than 150,000 questions from the audience, and a content marketing virtual assistant deployed by Ringier Axel Springer in Poland to boost German tourism generated 33,000 unique travel plans for users.\n“Experiments are great,” Broussard said. “But you’ve got to pay attention to the results of the experiment.”\nAccording to the research, Americans remain broadly wary of AI in the news:\n\nThere’s a clear disconnect between what journalists are actually doing with generative AI and what audiences think they’re using it for.\n“It’s not surprising,” said Zuri Berry, digital strategy editor at The Baltimore Banner. “It also serves as a confirmation of our current approach to AI, which entails disclosures, human review and verification and limitations on some tools that undermine our trust and credibility with readers.”\n\nChloe Lee Rowlands, web manager and data journalist at Bay City News Foundation, said that newsrooms must go beyond simple, begrudging disclosures and practice “radical transparency.” That means being intentional, specific and — in the case of cartoonist Joe Dworetzky — personal.\nDworetzky, like photojournalist Ray Saint Germain and others at Bay City News, wrote about his experience incorporating generative AI into his work. The sprawling piece chronicles his experience with ChatGPT’s DALL-E and Adobe Firefly, and learning how to prompt the programs to get what he actually wants.\n“I probably would’ve been a bit wary to task someone with that,” Rowlands said during a panel on local news at the summit. “But for him to come to me and be so interested in exploring that, I thought was a really ripe opportunity to explore those ethical considerations, but also emotional and personal considerations.”\n\nMediaWise, a digital media literacy initiative based at Poynter, debuted at the summit an AI literacy toolkit developed with AP aimed at bridging the digital divide between news consumers and journalists. The toolkit offers practical resources for newsrooms looking to engage audiences with AI literacy, along with examples of how some newsrooms are already communicating about AI.\nSerpico said he plans to pitch an AI literacy series to his bosses this week.\n“I’m personally interested in creating a series of videos that demonstrate how we’re using AI not to generate slop at scale,” he said, “but to transcribe the audio of eight school board meetings that take place at the same time each week so that our education reporters can more effectively get a grasp of the important topics that parents in those communities need to know about.”\nRyan Serpico, deputy director of newsroom AI and automation at Hearst Newspapers, shared lessons from Hearst’s Chowbot and Kamala Harris News Assistant at the second Summit on AI, Ethics and Journalism. (Courtesy: Keith Hughes)\nThe research also highlights the need to ask the audience for feedback while experimenting with generative AI, something Vania André, publisher and editor-in-chief of the Haitian Times, has done regularly. The Haitian Times planned to build a chatbot to surface immigration information but scrapped the idea after surveying readers, who were more interested in business news.\n“But it’s a sobering moment where, again, that echo chamber, right?” she said. “You would have thought this would have been something that everybody wanted and it was just the complete opposite.”\nToff often cites journalists writing for news junkies as a component of news avoidance. Audiences can feel like they turned on a random episode of “Game of Thrones” and are expected to know the characters and why storylines are important.\nGenerative AI — in the form of automated summaries, clickable explainers or even chatbots — holds promise in bringing casual readers closer to the story.\n“These tools can make packaging that information, all of that context, all of that background information that a lot of people just don’t have, and make that news more accessible to people,” Toff said. “I think there’s a real opportunity there to reach more and more of the public who right now feel pretty disconnected from news and its value.”\nMediaWise interactive learning designer Sean Marcus contributed to this story.\nTrump goes after NBC's Peter Alexander for Qatari plane question during meeting with South African president\nOf the 15 books in a list published by the Chicago Sun-Times and Philadelphia Inquirer, only five were real.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nTariffs are taxes. When they’re applied, they raise the cost of goods, so right now, U.S. residents (and those near enough to be affected) must pay more on tech products and other affected items.\nBut despite the flat numbers you may have seen in the news (i.e., a now 54 percent tariff on all imports from China, a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports, and the looming possibility of a 25 percent tariff on semiconductor imports), price increases may not end up so exact. Their full effect isn’t known yet either, like possible lower availability of products, which could further affect costs. I cover these details in PCWorld’s FAQ on the tech tariffs, as well as in a quicker rundown if you only have time for the highlights. \nEven knowing that seeing what a 54 percent bump looks like in real numbers makes it feel more real—so I sat down and made some tables to illustrate. (Honestly, doing this exercise was as much for me as for you all.) The results drive home a point mentioned to me more than once during my research: Tariffs are a regressive form of taxes, meaning the less money you make, the harder you’re hit. At the same time, how pinched you feel will vary depending on the purchase’s importance.\nI pulled the details for six laptops that PCWorld reviewed before the Chinese tariffs began in February, looking to represent the usual range of purchases. At $500, you’ll pay $170 more with a 54 percent tariff imposed; at $1,700, you’ll pay almost a thousand dollars ($918) more.\nFor budget buyers, another $170 will make a material difference in affordability—and ultimately, user experience. In this price range, performance feels tangibly worse if you have to step down to a cheaper model. Meanwhile, laptops that cost $1,000 and up already begin with much more specs. Stepping down slashes luxury upgrades, rather than necessary ones.\nNo matter what, though, you end up paying more for less.\nSimilar to laptops, the closer to entry-level you shop, the higher the real-world impact. A $50 increase on a $250 card already eats into any budget for extras—a card with better cooling, quieter acoustics, or a factory overclock. An increase of $136 could cause someone to skip the upgrade all together.\nWhether you shop at the low- or high-end, though, the tariffs will further disconnect the actual cost for graphics cards from their MSRP. Partner cards already went for another 20 to 30 percent above the reference cards produced by AMD, Intel, and Nvidia. Add in both the tariffs and demand (especially for newer cards with little stock available) and a reference card’s list price will likely have little resemblance to street pricing.\nWould a difference of $40 make you choose a different budget gaming monitor? Maybe not, actually. Most people buy a monitor and hang on to it for far longer than their PC. In fact, if you’re a laptop user, a monitor may be a splurge or upgrade purchase—something to increase the comfort of your setup at home, rather than a necessity.\nStill, the tariffs could cause a delay in when your budget will be ready for purchase—especially if costs continue to rise.\nLike monitors, you won’t buy a mouse, keyboard, or dock until you must (or you decide you want the upgrade). And because peripherals and accessories are largely more affordable, you may just bite the bullet and take the hit of a 54 percent increase if the price is low enough, as the Lemokey X0 keypad illustrates.\nBut the cost jump isn’t invisible. Sure, the Lemokey is already one of the most affordable gaming keypads available, so it still feels potentially tolerable at $51. But an extra $38 for a gaming mouse isn’t nothing. You can buy yourself a game with that money.\nA 14-year veteran of technology and video games journalism, Alaina Yee covers a variety of topics for PCWorld.

More percent of all U.S. imports from China.\nPresident Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are in a tit-for-tat trade war, each fully willing to escalate, with the fight against inflation directly in the line of fire.\nJust the top 15 imports from China in 2024 were valued at more than $190 billion, everything from cell phones to plastic tableware, video game consoles to furniture. China is either the first or second source for 12 of the 15. The 15 accounted for more than 43% of all imports from China last year – and the percentage from China has increased in eight so far this year.\nMore on those 15, but first a little context.\nToday, Trump announced tariffs on imports from China that could top 100%. I never thought I would write a sentence like this.\nThat was in response to the Chinese government announcing 34% “retaliatory” tariffs on U.S. exports to China last week and vowing to “fight to the end.” I never thought I would write a sentence like this either.\nThat was in response to Trump’s 34% “retaliatory” tariffs on Chinese imports, also announced last week. Same for this sentence: Never thought I would write it.\nBut that wasn’t actually in response to anything, at least not directly. Trump made that announcement against all the nations of the world, essentially, which he said had been “ripping us off” for a long time.\nOne point of clarification. In the last couple of days, top spokespeople for the administration have suggested that the United States has a trade deficit with all the world’s nations.\nActually, the United States had trade surpluses with 131 trade partners and deficits with 101 in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. It just has quite large ones with China, Mexico and a few other nations. I wrote about them previously. \nBut back to the testosterone-driven battle between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.\nThere are other tariffs beyond the back-and-forth described above, including those from Trump’s first term that former President Biden left in place. And steel and aluminum tariffs. And the proposed fee on every Chinese-manufactured ship – China now manufactures the majority of the world’s ships – with a fee of $1 million for each U.S. port of call.\nYou get the idea.\nOf course, this won’t only affect what Americans will be able to buy. I wrote previously about the U.S. exports likely to be caught up in this game of “one-downmanship.” China, for example, is the majority buyer of U.S. soybeans and the largest buyer in the primary aircraft category.\nAll totals in billions of dollars. \nHere’s a chart to compliment the one above. It shows the value of the top 15 and the percentage that came from China in 2024.\nThree are above 75% – the toys category, video game consoles and plastic tableware. Another five are above 40% – cell phone and related equipment, electric storage batteries, electric water and space heaters, misc. plastic articles, and the category that includes amplifiers, speakers and microphones.\nWhile tariffs are issues at the price point upon entry, a wholesale price of sorts, the ability to fight inflation will certainly not be helped by an escalating trade war within China, and certainly not one with the entire world.\n\n\n"}

After one decade of over-reliance on platform-driven growth, declining social media referrals and AI-driven traffic shifts are forcing publishers to rethink their audience strategies. Community is the way forward. It’s more than a buzzword — it’s a proven driver of engagement, retention and revenue.\nPublishers that successfully activate a community strategy are seeing measurable impact. According to data from Viafoura, community members generate 5.3x higher dwell time, are 45x more likely to subscribe and make 3x more site visits compared to standard audiences.\nCommunity members contributing user-generated content like comments, questions and reviews go even further. They visit publisher sites 6x more often per month, produce 3x more page views and spend 40x more time on site. Publishers can double their registration rates by fostering direct relationships with readers, unlocking deeper engagement and valuable first-party data.\nPersonalized community notifications, such as “someone replied to your comment” or “you gained a new follower,” also significantly outperform traditional alerts. These messages generate click-through rates up to 10x higher than standard notifications, making them a powerful tool for reengagement and habit-building.\nTraditional audience development strategies are losing effectiveness. A recent study by The Rebooting found 50% of publishers reported a decline in search traffic over the past year, with organic social media now ranking as a secondary priority for most publishers. \nTo compensate, publishers are shifting to direct, owned relationships with newsletters (62%) and direct traffic (57%) as the backbone of audience growth. The same study identifies attracting new audiences and building community as top audience development priorities in 2025.\nCommunity engagement is proving to be a critical counterbalance to these trends. As outlined in the Mather article, “The Power of Community: Meeting User Needs to Build Lasting Value,” user needs like “update me,” “connect me” and “keep me engaged” are best met through interactive experiences such as comment sections, live Q&As and community chats. Publishers integrating these features foster deeper relationships, leading to greater loyalty and long-term monetization.\nOne standout example is The Telegraph, which has made community central to its editorial and audience engagement strategy. Through its newly launched  “Your Say” community section, the publication showcases readers’ comments and contributions, highlights articles inspired by reader comments and features journalists answering questions and engaging directly with the community. In essence, The Telegraph is turning community into compelling content and featuring it in a dedicated, high-visibility part of their site. Furthermore, as highlighted in a recent article, community is a driver of engagement and positively impacts SEO, due to the amount of time users spend on content that includes community elements.\nGenerative AI is accelerating shifts in traffic patterns, pushing publishers to differentiate through trust and human curation. While AI can produce content, it can’t replicate the authenticity or real-time interaction that community engagement offers. According to this survey, 52% of publishers are prioritizing engagement depth alongside audience breadth. By investing in community-building, publishers create a buffer against algorithmic volatility and AI-driven content aggregation.\nBy owning the audience relationship, publishers can activate a successful community strategy. That means shifting away from rented distribution on third-party platforms and focusing instead on direct channels like newsletters, memberships and on-site engagement.\nCommunity members generate valuable declarative data that fuels personalization, improved ad targeting and subscription growth. This first-party data becomes increasingly important as traditional data sources decline and privacy regulations tighten.\nCommunity engagement also opens the door to diversified revenue streams. Publishers cultivating active user participation can unlock new business lines, including paid subscriptions, live and virtual events and sponsorship opportunities beyond standard display advertising.\nIntegrating community features, such as comment sections, live Q&As, exclusive forums and personalized content recommendations, directly impacts retention and loyalty. Publishers tracking and optimizing these efforts see higher dwell times, stronger conversion rates and more meaningful reader relationships.\nAs the industry shifts toward more direct, owned relationships, publishers failing to invest in community engagement risk leaving audience growth and revenue on the table. Platforms are unpredictable, but communities offer a sustainable path to building highly engaged, loyal audiences. The question is no longer whether to invest in community, but how soon publishers can begin.\nSponsored by Viafoura\nChatGPT is sending more of its traffic to publishers’ sites.\nGoogle tables proposals to Judge Brinkema, arguing the DOJ’s push for divestiture is unviable ahead of the September 22 remedy phase. \nGenerative AI content farms are stealing publishers’ ads.txt files to hijack ad revenue, according to DoubleVerify.\nGet access to tools and analysis to stay ahead of the trends transforming media and marketing\nVisit your account page to make changes and renew.\nGet Digiday's top stories every morning in your email inbox.\nFollow @Digiday for the latest news, insider access to events and more."}

That means digging deep into low-level architecture, optimizing what most people overlook, and constantly balancing trade-offs between performance, cost, and scale.\nToday, we’re kicking off a new blog series that showcases the platform-level work our Engineering team has been doing to build and run a modern cloud storage platform. The kind of work that usually stays buried in Jira tickets and internal docs, but that makes all the difference when you’re serving exabytes at scale.\nWhen people talk about cloud storage, they usually focus on capacity, availability, and price. This includes the systems, tools, and architectural decisions that enable our infrastructure to scale reliably while handling billions of operations per day.\nWe’re crafting a dynamic, evolving platform that handles exabytes of data with reliability and efficiency. We’re a platform that developers and businesses build on. That means durability, performance, uptime, and predictability aren’t just nice-to-haves—they’re fundamental requirements. As Senior Vice President of Engineering, I’m excited to pull back the curtain and offer a glimpse into the ongoing engineering efforts that power our platform.\nOne of our core engineering philosophies is this: Complexity should serve simplicity. For example, changing how we handle request headers might sound like a small thing, but when you operate a distributed system at scale, even tiny inefficiencies can multiply quickly. A 5% improvement in API response time might not sound dramatic, but at exabyte scale, that translates to millions of faster interactions per day, less CPU usage, and better customer experiences across the board.\nOur Engineering team is always thinking about those compound effects. Sometimes that means rewriting parts of a system that have been stable for years. Other times it means saying no to flashy solutions and choosing battle-tested designs that will hold up under load.\nIf you care about performance, distributed architecture, or what it actually takes to run a reliable cloud infrastructure, this is for you. We’ve published deep dives before, such as our articles on Load Balancing (and Load Balancing 2.0!), improvements on small file uploads that gave us speeds faster than AWS, Network Stats, Reed-Solomon erasure coding, using native code in Backblaze Personal Backup, everything that lives in the Backblaze Github, and many, many more. \nOur goal, in addition to talking about the individual stories, is to start talking about some of the throughlines—when one project spawns another, or how we decide which project to pursue when there are competing priorities. \nThese projects don’t usually make headlines on their own, but taken together, they form the backbone of what makes Backblaze perform the way it does. They’ll become part of our regularly scheduled programming, and we’ll drop them in our Tech Lab category so you can find them easily.\nSign up for the Backblaze Developer Newsletter to receive a monthly roundup of articles and news for everyone developing on Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage.\nWe’re proud of the work our engineers are doing, but more than that, we think it’s worth sharing. Whether you’re a fellow cloud architect, a developer using our platform, or just someone curious about what it takes to run cloud infrastructure at scale, we hope this series offers something insightful. \nTechnology doesn’t stand still, and neither do we. The more efficient our platform becomes, the better we can serve our customers—and the more we can invest in new ideas. So stay tuned. We’re kicking things off in this content series in the next few weeks, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts!\n Tina Cessna has served as our senior vice president of engineering since 2018. In her role, she has guided our engineering efforts to open Backblaze’s services to ever broadening audiences, including the launch of the Backblaze S3 Compatible API. Prior to joining Backblaze, Tina led engineering and QA at Salesforce, Cisco, Linksys, and Oracle. She brings 25 years of software development experience to the role, building complex enterprise and consumer applications, as well as a blend of technology experience in PaaS, SaaS, embedded systems, and network routing. Tina earned a B.S.E.E in electronic and computer engineering from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.\n\nMay 22, 2025\n\n\nMay 15, 2025\n\n\nMay 13, 2025\n"}

How badly did Trump hurt America? \nA top trade expert says our country will take hundreds of years to recover from Donald Trump's tariffs. \nTrade Expert Explains Impact of Tariff War\nWilson re-upped a pod episode featuring Edward Goldberg that aired before the 2024 election. Goldberg is an adjunct professor at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs and a political economy and trade expert. Goldberg gave context to the harm Trump inflicts on our country with a historical example. The trade expert told Wilson:\n\"In 1405, China was very open to the whole world. It's one of the richest countries or the richest country in the world.\nIt set out a huge fleet all the way through the Indian Ocean to Africa under its admiral Zheng He and really to trade and show China's power. It was extremely successful, really increased the Chinese economy, brought back articles from around the world to China.\"\nGoldberg continued to explain to Wilson how Chinese history parallels our current situation.\n\"The new emperor comes about and gets threatened with the idea of foreigners and foreign goods coming into China.\nHe burns the fleet.\n\nAnd it took it basically up until I would say, oh, I guess 1998, 2000, for China to be at the same place economically around the world since they closed it off from foreigners in 1433.\" \nThe Scale of Trump's Destruction\nGoldberg tells Wilson that what Trump is doing is so bad, it will take hundreds of years for our country to recover, if it ever does. The professor summed up the destruction of our 47th president:\n\"The scale of what Trump is proposing when he says these global tariffs on every single product coming into America.

So when we got word the university’s channel on an open access journal platform disappeared, we were curious what might be going on. \nJust this year, we reported Saveetha was among 14 universities with “questionable publication practices,” defined as unusually fast growth in research output, as measured by published journal articles.\nOur 2023 investigation into Saveetha’s dental school uncovered an elaborate self-citation scheme: Undergraduates write manuscripts as part of their exams; student and faculty reviewers then insert scores of citations to papers by Saveetha faculty to inflate the university’s citation rankings. \nThat year we also reported the school offered an adjunct position — and payment — to a prominent economist in exchange for adding his Saveetha affiliation to his papers.\nLast year, we reported on the flood of low quality, AI-generated commentaries overwhelming journals’ manuscript pipeline. Our investigation found Saveetha authors had published more than 1,200 letters, comments and editorials in 2024, a ninefold increase from the year before.  And Saveetha topped the list of author affiliations on retracted papers from Neurosurgical Review, a Springer Nature title working to clear its catalog of AI-generated articles. \nGiven what our past reporting turned up, when bibliometrics expert Reese Richardson wrote to tell us the Saveetha’s channel at Cureus, part of Springer Nature, has disappeared, it seemed worth a closer look. \nChannels on the publishing platform enable “channel members to publish peer-reviewed articles, as well as post meeting abstracts, posters, announcements and other content produced by channel members, staff, residents, and/or students,” according to a guide on the Cureus website. Institutions pay a fee to have a Cureus channel.\nSo, did Cureus take down Saveetha’s channel for all its ties to questionable citation practices? Did the publisher audit all channels and remove those with unusual activity? \nThe response from a Cureus spokesperson:\nThe channel was closed on March 18th because of non-payment of fees. No other channels were removed.\nSaveetha didn’t pay its bill. \nBut Richardson, who’s at Northwestern University and worked with us on the 2024 investigation, maintains there should be more quality control on Cureus’ part: \nCureus’ response implies that had Saveetha continued to pay their fee, they would have kept their channel.

Yet Idrissa Gana Gueye, a battle-hardened veteran of Goodison Park, set tribal tensions aside to give glowing praise to former Liverpool forward Sadio Mane.\nIn an interview quoted by Galsenfoot from Showmax in Senegal, Gueye described Mane as “the best Senegalese ever to play in the Premier League”—an accolade made all the more remarkable considering the player’s Everton allegiance. “It may be hard for me to say, but Sadio is the best Senegalese ever to play in the Premier League, he just played with the wrong colour,” he said.\nThis public tribute comes in the wake of a fiery Merseyside season. Across two fixtures, 52 fouls and 10 yellow cards were recorded, with both matches marred by ugly scenes. February’s clash at Goodison Park ended in a mass confrontation after James Tarkowski’s late equaliser, resulting in four red cards post-match, including dismissals for Curtis Jones, Abdoulaye Doucouré, and Liverpool boss Arne Slot.\nIn April at Anfield, the tensions only escalated when Tarkowski’s 11th-minute high tackle on Alexis Mac Allister went unpunished with only a yellow, sparking backlash that forced PGMOL to concede it was a red card offence. Amidst all this acrimony, Gueye’s comments provide a rare moment of reflection and admiration.\nMane’s legacy at Liverpool is etched in both silverware and sentiment. During his time at Anfield, he won the Premier League, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup, while also forming a legendary front three with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino.\n“He is the king of Senegal, and I am so proud of him. He represents the country in the best possible way,” said Gueye. “He scored many goals, won many assists, and won numerous trophies. I am therefore very pleased to have him in Senegal and his career. He showed young Africans that anything is possible.”\n\nThe Everton midfielder also shared insights into their ongoing friendship, forged on the international stage but never severed by club loyalties. “He’s a great guy, a very good example for everyone. He is an excellent player, a great person and a very good friend,” Gueye said.\n“Even when he played for rival clubs, we were always talking to each other. He would send me text messages when we were playing against each other, and we’ve been in touch until now.”\nMane’s impact continues outside of Europe. At Al Nassr this season, the 32-year-old has recorded 7 goals and 8 assists in 25 league appearances—a reminder that while he may have left Liverpool, he hasn’t faded from relevance.\nGueye’s tribute isn’t just a personal salute—it speaks to a broader sentiment in Senegal and beyond. Mane is seen as a symbol of what African players can achieve in the modern game. From his humility off the pitch to his relentless energy on it, he remains a beacon for young talents across the continent.\nHis time in England may have ended, but his influence on and off the pitch lives on, immortalised not just in medals, but in the words of peers and opponents alike.\nAs Liverpool fans, it’s heartening—but hardly surprising—to hear such praise from an Everton player. Sadio Mane wasn’t just a match-winner, he was a mindset. He embodied Klopp’s Liverpool at its peak: fearless, fast, ferocious, and full of heart.\nWhile the wounds of this season’s brutal derbies are still fresh, Gueye’s tribute reminds us that true greatness transcends the tribal. That he can look beyond the rivalry and call Mane “the king of Senegal” tells you everything about the respect Mane commands.\nSlot’s Liverpool is carving a new identity now, but Mane’s legacy remains in the stands, the streets, and the soul of the club. He gave everything. And though he’s now finding space in Saudi Arabia rather than sprinting down the left at Anfield, he’ll forever be a red in the minds of those who watched him light up the Kop.\nAnd let’s be honest—“he just played with the wrong colour”? That’s probably the bluest compliment we’ll ever accept.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

As Arne Slot begins to shape his first full season in charge, a new central striker has become a pressing priority — and Isak has emerged as the standout target.\nThe need for a more reliable presence through the middle has only grown clearer in recent weeks. Both Darwin Nunez and Diogo Jota have struggled for consistency and fitness, and with Nunez expected to move on — likely to the Saudi Pro League — Liverpool are seeking a clinical, composed finisher.\nIsak fits the bill. The 25-year-old Sweden international has been in prolific form, scoring 24 goals in all competitions this season for Newcastle, including the winner in the Carabao Cup final — ironically, against Liverpool.\nRousing the Kop states that despite Newcastle’s efforts to tie him down to a new contract, Liverpool “are understood to hold a belief they can land their man.” While negotiations are expected to be difficult — both in terms of fee and Newcastle’s reluctance to sell — Liverpool remain confident that their long-standing admiration for Isak can tip the balance.\nA stumbling block may emerge if Newcastle succeed in offering Isak a significant wage increase. The forward is reportedly on a deal that does not reflect his current value or form. Discussions over new terms are ongoing at St James’ Park, but if no agreement is reached, Liverpool are believed to be ready to pounce.\nSources close to the Anfield club believe Isak would thrive under Slot’s high-possession system and could be the long-term solution to Liverpool’s centre-forward conundrum.\nWhile Isak remains the top priority, Liverpool are also keeping tabs on other striking options. Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko have both been assessed, with internal analysis ongoing. Meanwhile, Victor Osimhen has been linked, though the report suggests he is not currently seen as a front-runner despite a reduced asking price of under £50 million.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\nIf this comes off, it could be the signing that defines the next chapter at Liverpool. Alexander Isak has all the tools: pace, movement, intelligence in tight spaces, and a knack for scoring in big moments. He’s not just another option — he’s the elite-level striker this side has needed since the decline of Firmino’s peak years.\nFor many fans, watching Nunez’s inconsistency and Jota’s injury setbacks has been frustrating. There’s no questioning their effort, but what Liverpool need now is precision — someone who can finish the chances created by the likes of Szoboszlai and Diaz week in, week out. Isak brings that.\nOf course, there’s a concern about Newcastle digging in, especially given their European ambitions. But if we’re serious about backing Slot and evolving this side, these are the kinds of deals we have to push through. The idea of Isak in a red shirt at Anfield is mouth-watering — let’s hope it happens.\n\n\n\n\nIf this comes off, it could be the signing that defines the next chapter at Liverpool.

This was their third loss in four matches across all competitions and arguably their poorest defensive display of the season. The champions-elect, who had gone 26 Premier League games unbeaten, looked nothing like title winners against Marco Silva’s side.\nAs The Telegraph reported, “The champions-elect are the best team in the land but they certainly did not look like it here, against an aggressive and organised Fulham, as their 26-game unbeaten league run came to an end.”\nQuestions are now emerging over the once-dependable core of Arne Slot’s Liverpool. “Some of the certainties of Liverpool’s season – an immaculate Virgil van Dijk, for example, or a decisive Mohamed Salah – are seemingly no longer guaranteed.” Van Dijk struggled mightily against Fulham’s Rodrigo Muniz, and Salah’s drought extended to seven club games without a goal from open play.\nAlex Iwobi, full of invention and spark, “outshone here by Fulham’s Alex Iwobi,” added insult to injury for the Merseysiders.\nLiverpool’s early lead via a sublime individual strike from Alexis Mac Allister was a mere flash of hope. What followed was 14 minutes of defensive collapse. “Those 14 minutes were remarkable in their defensive incompetence, with Curtis Jones and Andy Robertson both at fault and Van Dijk totally beaten by Muniz.”\nThat tailspin stunned the visitors. While the second-half revival, capped by a goal from Luis Díaz, showed promise, the inconsistency was too much. As The Telegraph put it: “If they keep playing like they did in the first half, they might not win again this season.”\nFulham’s attacking trio—Ryan Sessegnon, Iwobi, and Muniz—delivered both substance and style. Behind them, centre-back Calvin Bassey was immense. His second-half display matched the fervour of Craven Cottage, where “the home supporters could not help but match his energy.”\nMarco Silva’s side, now pushing for European qualification, earned every inch of this result through structure, intensity, and belief.\nThere’s no escaping it—this wasn’t a blip, it was a blueprint for how to beat Liverpool. Slot’s side looked fractured in the first half, not just defensively but in terms of mentality. That three-goal blitz wasn’t about bad luck; it was about a lack of composure and organisation. For Van Dijk to be so handily beaten by Muniz is unthinkable a few seasons ago. And Salah’s goalless streak? It’s turning into a serious issue at the worst possible time.\nYes, the league cushion remains healthy, but this is a momentum game. One slip becomes two, and suddenly it’s a title race again. If the first-half version of this team shows up again, fans will start to question whether Slot has instilled enough resilience. The second half was encouraging—but we’ve seen this pattern before. Fix the defending or face an anxious run-in.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

David Ornstein, speaking to NBC, sheds light on what appears to be a promising horizon for the Dutch defender at Liverpool. Ornstein’s insights echo a sentiment of optimism, suggesting that it’s a matter of “when” rather than “if” van Dijk will renew his commitment to the Reds. As he states, “The negotiations have been positive and cordial,” highlighting the smooth nature of discussions between the player and the club.\nAt 33, Virgil van Dijk remains a pillar of strength and reliability for Liverpool. His role is crucial under manager Arne Slot, and his performances consistently reflect his importance. The fact that he has not missed a minute of Liverpool’s Premier League campaign this season is a testament to his fitness and dedication. This level of consistency is rare and invaluable, particularly in a league as demanding as the Premier League. With Liverpool conceding only 30 goals in 31 matches, van Dijk’s leadership at the back is undeniable.\nThe heart of Liverpool’s defence, van Dijk, revealed progress in his contract talks following a match. “There is progress, yeah,” he confirmed, expressing his affection for the club and its supporters. His words, “I love the club, I love the fans,” resonate with the mutual appreciation between the player and the Liverpool faithful. It’s this bond that often tips the scales in favour of long-term commitments between players and their clubs.\nIn conjunction with van Dijk’s news, Liverpool also seems poised to secure Mohamed Salah’s future. Ornstein’s commentary extends beyond just van Dijk, indicating a similar positive trajectory in negotiations with Salah. This strategic move to secure key players underscores Liverpool’s intentions to maintain their core squad, ensuring stability and continuity.\nThe news of Virgil van Dijk’s contract negotiations moving in a positive direction is exactly what we need after a period of uncertainty. His unwavering presence and performance level make him indispensable to the team’s structure and aspirations. The thought of him continuing at Anfield is not just comforting; it’s exhilarating.\nMoreover, the potential simultaneous renewal of Mohamed Salah’s contract could be the catalyst needed for Liverpool to push for greater achievements. With Arne Slot at the helm, securing the backbone of our squad signifies a commitment to a prosperous era ahead. It’s about building on the foundation laid by legends and steering towards a future filled with triumphs.\nIn conclusion, the developments around van Dijk’s contract, as well as Salah’s, paint a picture of a club that’s not just reacting to changes but strategically planning for a competitive edge. As fans, we can look forward to more moments of brilliance, more matches won, and hopefully, more titles at Anfield.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

The task was monumental: evolving a team that had seen its fair share of glory under Klopp into a fresh, dominant force. Slot, previously with Feyenoord, has not only met but surpassed these expectations, steering Liverpool to the top of the Premier League with an impressive lead. Harry Kewell, speaking to Sky Sports News, emphasized how Slot’s strategy has been integral in this transformation.\n“Fantastic, I don’t think he could have wished for a better opportunity,” Kewell remarked, noting how the Premier League landscape this season provided a prime opportunity for Slot. The decline in form of major rivals like Arsenal and Manchester City created an opening that Liverpool expertly exploited.\n\nA key factor in Liverpool’s success this season, as Kewell pointed out, has been the unexpected drop-off in performance from their closest rivals. Arsenal and Manchester City, who were neck-and-neck in the previous season, have faced significant challenges. Arsenal’s season was marred by crucial injuries, while City seemed to struggle with an identity crisis, leading to their worst campaign in recent years.\n“It’s harsh for what I’m about to say, but it’s kinda help that Arsenal have had a terrible time, City have had a terrible time, Chelsea have not been up there, nobody’s really challenged them,” Kewell explained. This backdrop has undeniably played a role in Liverpool’s campaign, allowing them to capitalise and build a substantial lead early in the season.\nDiscussing the elements of luck in football can often be controversial, yet it remains a persistent factor in any team’s title chase. This season, Liverpool have been fortunate in maintaining a largely healthy squad, in stark contrast to their rivals. Historical comparisons drawn by Kewell to teams like Chelsea under Antonio Conte and the miraculous Leicester City campaign further underline that health and consistency often correlate strongly with success.\n“Indeed, luck is needed to win the Premier League, and Liverpool were given the golden ticket this season,” stated Kewell. This acknowledgement doesn’t diminish Liverpool’s achievements but rather highlights the unpredictable nature of football where fitness and form can sway fortunes dramatically.\nAs Liverpool approach the final games of the season, the focus will inevitably shift towards sustainability. Can Slot adapt and evolve the team further to maintain this high level of performance? The ongoing interest in new signings and contract updates will play a crucial role in Liverpool’s strategy moving forward.\nAs Liverpool fans, it’s hard not to be excited about the future under Arne Slot. His first season could end in a storybook fashion with a Premier League title, something that seemed a distant dream last summer. This achievement speaks volumes about his managerial acumen and ability to maximise the potential of Klopp’s last squad.\nThe fact that our rivals have stumbled this season shouldn’t take away from the brilliance displayed at Anfield. Instead, it should be seen as part of the ebb and flow that every team experiences in the fiercely competitive Premier League. What’s important is that Liverpool took their chance, demonstrating resilience and tactical prowess.\nLooking ahead, the real test for Slot and his squad will be next season, with expectations set even higher. Maintaining this level of performance, integrating new talents, and possibly contending on multiple fronts will be the challenges lying ahead. However, with a manager like Slot, who has already shown he can turn potential into excellence, Liverpool fans have every reason to remain hopeful and supportive.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

Yet as this title race edges toward the sharp end, the weight of absence continues to bear down on Arne Slot’s side. Injuries have bitten hard — not in volume, but in vital areas — and while the squad continues to scrap and stretch, the need for reinforcements from within grows louder with each passing week.\nAlisson Becker is not merely a goalkeeper. He’s a presence. The kind who can change the tempo of a game with a fingertip save or a calm pass under pressure. So when Liverpool lined up at Craven Cottage without him, there was always going to be a difference.\nThe Brazilian was sidelined again after failing to clear concussion protocols, having taken a heavy knock during Brazil’s clash with Colombia. Slot, pragmatic as ever, explained:\n“It’s concussion and as we all know you have to tick all the boxes. Next week hopefully he can play but the protocol means not yet.”\nThat return date — Sunday April 13 against West Ham — can’t come soon enough for a team walking the line between control and chaos.\nIt says plenty about Liverpool’s right-back situation that Conor Bradley’s return from injury felt like a jolt of electricity. The youngster even chipped in with an assist against Fulham, but it only highlighted how much has been missing.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold, once central to Liverpool’s creative rhythm, remains out with an ankle injury picked up against PSG. And while the injury is one thing, it’s the growing noise around his contract — or lack thereof — that’s beginning to shape the narrative.\nSlot was blunt:\n“He will not be back in the upcoming weeks.”\nWhether he returns in red before the season’s end, or at all, is increasingly up in the air. Potential return date: May 2025.\n\nGomez Setback Adds to Defensive Strain\nJoe Gomez’s absence has been another unwelcome subplot. The defender, a versatile piece of the puzzle, managed just ten minutes on his FA Cup return before his hamstring gave way. Surgery followed, and so did the silence.\nPhoto: IMAGO\nSlot’s assessment was simple, if sobering:\n\n“Joe Gomez had surgery for his hamstring injury, so he’s out for a long time. He will be back maybe just before the end of the season.”\n\nAt this stage, that feels optimistic. Liverpool’s defence, already thin, could do with his timing and poise. Potential return date: May 2025.\nMorton Out for the Run-In\nTyler Morton, who had been building rhythm in the heart of midfield, now looks set to miss the rest of the season following a shoulder injury that required surgery. Slot initially downplayed the issue, but reports since suggest a far more serious prognosis.\nPhoto: IMAGO\nWith depth already an issue, Morton’s absence removes yet another option from the rotation. Potential return date: Summer 2025.\nInjuries are not new at Liverpool. But with a title hanging in the balance and every point contested, the margin for error shrinks. Each return is a small salvation — but for now, the absentees are as important as those on the pitch.\n\n\n\n\nJoe Gomez’s absence has been another unwelcome subplot.

Since his transfer from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020 for £45 million—a move initially hailed as a steal—Jota has been sidelined for 93 matches due to various injuries. These absences are equivalent to almost two full seasons out of action, an alarming statistic for any top-flight player.\nHis 2023/24 season was particularly telling, with a knee collateral ligament tear followed by a hip injury, keeping him out for a significant number of games. The pattern of injuries has continued into the current season, with Jota already missing games due to a muscle injury. Despite his commendable scoring rate of 64 goals and 22 assists in 174 appearances, his persistent fitness issues have led to frustrations among the Liverpool faithful.\nThe potential departure of Jota is part of a broader narrative at Liverpool, where the attacking lineup could see a significant reshuffle. With stars like Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez also rumoured to be on their way out, and Mohamed Salah’s contract up in 2025, the Reds find themselves at a strategic juncture. The once formidable attacking force that Liverpool boasted is in need of a revamp, considering the unreliability of key players due to injuries.\nAs reported by Empire of the Kop, Liverpool have placed a price tag of €50m-€55m (£42.9m-£47.2m) on Jota. This valuation comes amidst growing interest from clubs like Wolves, Aston Villa, and Newcastle United, with the latter already engaged in preliminary talks for a possible swap deal involving Alexander Isak.\nThe speculation around Jota’s future is intensifying as the summer transfer window approaches. Liverpool’s management, wary of his frequent absences—which account for 30-40% of potential playing time each season—are contemplating strategic alternatives to rebuild and stabilise the team’s offensive prowess.\nA swap deal involving Newcastle’s Alexander Isak could be a beneficial move for Liverpool. Isak’s robust playing style and lower injury profile could make him a more reliable asset for Liverpool’s front line. This potential move underscores a pivotal offseason strategy for Liverpool as they aim to reconstruct their squad for greater resilience and consistent performance.\nThe financial implications of Jota’s potential transfer are significant. At a time when player valuations are soaring, securing a fee in the region of £45 million could provide Liverpool with the necessary funds to invest in a less injury-prone forward. This strategy could also help mitigate the risk of future squad disruptions due to player unavailability.\nFrom a supporter’s perspective, the situation with Diogo Jota is disheartening but understandable. Jota has been a vibrant force when fit, displaying the kind of attacking flair that Anfield spectators cherish. However, the harsh reality of his frequent injuries cannot be overlooked. Every match he misses is a reminder of the fragility that has come to define his time at Liverpool.\nThe potential acquisition of Alexander Isak or another less injury-prone player might not only offer more stability but could also reignite the dynamic attacking spirit at Anfield. While it’s tough to see a player of Jota’s calibre leave, Liverpool’s focus must be on building a team that can consistently compete at the highest level without being handicapped by injuries.\nIt’s a pivotal moment for Liverpool and manager Arne Slot, who must navigate these choppy waters carefully. The decisions made this summer could very well define Liverpool’s trajectory for the coming seasons, and ensuring the right balance between talent and reliability will be key to future successes.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

Speaking on the latest AEye Scouted Football Podcast, Dave Hendrick and Karl Matchett dissected the futures of several of Liverpool’s most important players, and the message was clear: when it comes to Liverpool defenders and contracts, urgency is no longer optional.\nVan Dijk’s influence is as seismic as ever, despite isolated lapses. “Van Dijk yesterday did worry me a little bit,” Dave admitted, citing a performance that felt “really laxidasical, really lazy.” Yet, he was quick to stress, “It’s very much not the norm with Virgil. I think he’s been incredible all season.”\nAEye Scouted: Lovren Scale & Contracts\nWith @HendrickD82 & @karlmatchett\n Listen: https://t.co/iQEFaycOTv pic.twitter.com/T0PZGV5yD7\n— AnfieldIndex (@AnfieldIndex) April 7, 2025\n\nOn the question of extending Van Dijk’s contract, both hosts were in agreement. “I’d be giving him two years for certain,” said Karl. Dave echoed the sentiment: “Short-term performances shouldn’t really factor in… Physically, I don’t really have too many worries about Van Dijk at 35.”\nThe debate was not about whether to extend the Dutchman, but how generously. “Liverpool need to ask themselves the question: where would we be this season if we replaced Virgil with a similar-level centre-back?” Dave challenged. “We’d probably be fourth or fifth.”\nAt 26, Ibrahima Konaté is expected to be a cornerstone of Liverpool’s defence. But the contract discussion was complicated by fitness issues. “Reports suggest he wants in around the 200 grand a week mark,” said Dave. “I don’t think that’s an outrageous demand… the concern obviously is the injuries.”\nKarl made his position clear: “I don’t have a problem with him getting very, very high wages… as long as they are really well weighted towards performance and achievement.” Incentivised contracts, it seems, are the pragmatic path forward.\nThe left-back situation is more delicate. “I know you prefer to sell Robertson this summer,” Karl told Dave. “Even if it was just one year left on his deal and one year left on him to stay, that’s what I would do.”\nJoe Gomez, meanwhile, remains a conundrum. “He’s had a lot of injuries,” Dave pointed out. “The best thing he could do is move on and go play regularly somewhere.” Karl agreed, noting that despite his decade at the club, “I don’t really see that we can look at him as somebody to rely upon.”\nThe pair concluded that if a “decent fee”—in the region of £25m or more—came in, Liverpool should sanction a sale. “Let’s find a deal,” Dave urged.\nWhile much of the conversation focused on established players, both Matchett and Hendrick were enthusiastic about Liverpool’s emerging defensive talent. “Get Bradley locked up,” Dave insisted. “He looks like the future of that position for us.”\nJarell Quansah was also name-checked as the only player currently contracted through to 2029. “No reason to be even thinking about contracts with him,” Karl said. “He is the longest remaining contract at the club.”\nAs Liverpool recalibrates under new leadership, it’s clear that decisive contract action is needed—particularly around defenders who continue to shape their season. Whether it’s extending stalwarts like Van Dijk, protecting investment in Konaté, or saying difficult goodbyes to Robertson or Gomez, the club’s handling of these negotiations will be pivotal.\nAs Dave succinctly put it: “I don’t see how the club are not falling over themselves to make sure these two lads [Van Dijk and Salah] are locked down.”\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

On Media Matters, David Lynch joined host Dave Davis in a wide-ranging and revealing episode for Anfield Index, offering clarity on summer priorities, midfielder speculation, and recent comments from David Ornstein that caused a stir among supporters.\nA segment of Liverpool fans found themselves disheartened after The Athletic’s David Ornstein suggested in a Q&A that midfield is not currently at the top of Liverpool’s transfer priority list. “If that’s the case,” Dave Davis said on the podcast, “surely a midfielder has got to come in,” expressing concern over the lack of physicality in the current options.\nLynch didn’t dispute Ornstein’s claim, but added much-needed nuance: “I don’t think it’s going to be someone you sign who’s a nailed-on starter. I think what’s going to happen is… there’s a very big chance that Endo leaves and you need to bring someone in to kind of supplement that.”\n\n\nThe suggestion is clear: Liverpool could move for a versatile midfielder, capable of rotation and offering more physicality than Endo, but fans expecting a marquee addition like Aurélien Tchouaméni might be disappointed.\nOne name that continues to surface is Victor Osimhen. Lynch acknowledged that “I wouldn’t doubt for a second… he’s someone they’re kind of keeping an eye on,” citing Osimhen’s goal record and Premier League suitability. However, there are caveats.\nWage demands remain a stumbling block: “If his wage demands haven’t changed, then it’s just not very Liverpool.” Lynch highlighted that even if the Nigerian striker’s price drops to around £50–60 million, his salary expectations could still be a dealbreaker.\nOn potential forward targets, Lynch added, “Nunez will leave,” implying a centre-forward is a certainty this summer. Still, he poured cold water on many of the links doing the rounds: “Isak – probably ungettable… players score in the Bundesliga and then maybe not be able to translate that to the Premier League.”\nDavis made no secret of his view that the midfield needs steel: “That midfield… it lacks physicality, it really does.” He suggested that the current trusted four under Arne Slot may not be enough if Liverpool are to evolve into a truly elite side.\nLynch agreed in part but downplayed the idea of an overhaul: “There are just bigger issues in this team that need sorting first… a rotational midfielder is not in your top three issues.”\nYet, he acknowledged that the player Liverpool target could “bring some more physical qualities and be a bit better on the ball than Endo.”\nReflecting on Liverpool’s summer structure, Lynch delivered a grounded reality check to those hoping for a busy window: “The squad will not be any bigger next season. It won’t be bigger. It will be one in, one out.”\nThat theme of realistic planning underpinned much of his insight. Antoine Semenyo was also discussed as “a player who kind of ticks a lot of boxes,” although not a top target, while Morgan Rogers was described as “a fantastic player” but unlikely due to positional priorities.\nEven when discussing Ornstein’s comments about midfield not being a pressing concern, Lynch reinforced that the squad isn’t built for constant upheaval: “It’s just not very Liverpool to do that.”\nIn a moment of clarity, he summarised the wider fatigue debate among fans: “Football happens. It’s not always fatigue… This mad obsession with it is just an attempt to apply what limited knowledge we have to an outcome we can’t control.”\nWhile some Liverpool supporters may hope for headline-making signings, Lynch’s insights reinforce the club’s long-standing approach: pragmatism over panic. The podcast, hosted expertly by Dave Davis, was a masterclass in responsible reporting and measured realism — with a few truths that needed saying.\n“If this is fatigue, then they’re going to have fatigue next season as well,” said Lynch. It’s that sort of clarity that makes Media Matters such a vital listen.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

A recent Telegraph article takes aim at the Dutchman’s disciplinary record and raises a compelling question: is Van Dijk’s reputation shielding him from appropriate punishment?\nThe match that reignited the debate was Liverpool’s recent trip to Fulham. Just five minutes in, Van Dijk clattered into Rodrigo Muniz with a thunderous body check that left the Fulham striker grimacing. The incident, along with a concurrent foul by Caoimhín Kelleher on Andreas Pereira, was quickly dismissed by VAR as “a coming together and not a reckless action.” It was a statement that left opposition fans fuming and pundits baffled.\nLater, in the 71st minute and moments before Luis Díaz made it 3-2, Van Dijk swung a forearm towards the head of Sander Berge. No punishment followed. Once again, the Dutchman escaped sanction.\nThe Telegraph enlisted Keith Hackett, former head of Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), to review the mounting list of flashpoints in Van Dijk’s career. Hackett’s assessment is damning:\n“Virgil van Dijk once again unfairly impedes his opponent. He knows exactly what he is doing… Van Dijk is a serial offender and gets away with another one.”\nIn his eyes, Liverpool’s captain doesn’t just benefit from favourable decisions — he repeatedly commits offences that should have been met with red or yellow cards.\nTake, for example, Van Dijk’s forearm swing on Sander Berge. Hackett didn’t hesitate:\n“Van Dijk swings his forearm at Sander Berge from a Fulham corner but it is ignored by the officials… It has excessive force so should be a sending off.”\nOr cast your mind back to the 2022-23 Merseyside Derby, where Van Dijk planted his studs into Amadou Onana’s shin. VAR didn’t intervene, much to the confusion of then-Everton manager Frank Lampard:\n“It was up on Amadou’s shin… I’m surprised it hasn’t gone to VAR and they haven’t asked the ref to go and look at it.”\n“Van Dijk’s challenge used excessive force and endangered the safety of his opponent… fulfilled the criteria for serious foul play.”Verdict: RED CARD\nThis wasn’t a one-off. Van Dijk’s challenge on Auston Trusty, where he grabbed the Sheffield United player around the throat and forced him to the ground, also went unpunished. Hackett again:\n“When I ran PGMOL, this would have been an automatic red-card offence.”Verdict: RED CARD\nEven as Liverpool surged to the top of the table and marched through Europe this season, Van Dijk’s combative streak continued. Against Arsenal in October, he delivered two kicks to Kai Havertz after being pulled back. Hackett concluded that while not violent enough for red, it certainly deserved a yellow:\nVerdict: YELLOW CARD\nThere was also the early December thriller at St. James’ Park. Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon was body-checked in the box by Van Dijk. No penalty, no VAR review. Yet Hackett saw it differently:\n“Van Dijk deliberately changing direction… should have resulted in a penalty kick and a minimum yellow card.”Verdict: PENALTY AND YELLOW CARD\nAnd then there’s Dominic Solanke, the Bournemouth striker and former Liverpool man. In the EFL Cup semi-final against Spurs, Van Dijk was accused of raking his studs down the back of Solanke’s calf. Once more, no action from the officials.\nVerdict: YELLOW CARD\nHis altercation with Richarlison, too, was brushed aside by referee Craig Pawson. Hackett believed the bare minimum sanction was a yellow card.\nVerdict: YELLOW CARD\nIn total, Hackett examined seven incidents — six of which occurred after Van Dijk became Liverpool’s captain. All but one, he claimed, warranted a card or penalty.\nCould Van Dijk’s new role as club captain explain the apparent soft-glove treatment? Hackett seems to think so.\n“One hour before a game kicks off, Van Dijk will… go into the referee’s dressing room and be introduced… I just wonder whether the conversations between the referee and Van Dijk are fairly amicable and that the referees are falling into a trap.”\nThere’s no denying that the Dutchman exudes calm, confidence and authority — all traits referees might naturally gravitate toward in the heat of a game. But should such qualities lead to a blind eye being turned? Hackett’s view is firm:\n“There is no doubt as far as I’m concerned that this player has become a serial offender and match officials are failing to apply the appropriate sanctions.”\nIt’s an extraordinary claim — and one that opens up wider questions about how reputation can influence officiating in modern football.\nThis isn’t a new debate in football. From Roy Keane’s intimidation to Sergio Ramos’ persistent dark arts, elite players have always found ways to play the margins. But the game now boasts VAR, countless camera angles and layers of review. So how does Van Dijk keep evading repercussions?\nThe answer may lie in the blend of elite positioning, calm demeanour and a perception of fairness. He rarely looks aggressive, even when making impactful challenges. But Hackett’s analysis unravels that perception with forensic precision.\nHis words carry weight not because of who they’re about — but because of what they reveal: that even in the age of technology and accountability, certain players might still live in a protective halo, shielded by their stature.\nLiverpool fans may view this criticism as an attack on their captain and team. Neutral observers may see it as long-overdue scrutiny of one of the Premier League’s most admired players.\nEither way, the discussion sparked by The Telegraph offers a timely reminder: even the best must be held to account. Especially when their actions have the power to change games — and seasons.\nAs Liverpool fans, we’re proud of what Van Dijk has achieved. He’s been a colossal presence since arriving at Anfield and a symbol of defensive excellence. But this piece does leave us asking uncomfortable questions.\nFirstly, the volume of incidents highlighted is difficult to ignore. While we’re used to rival fans moaning about refereeing bias, having Keith Hackett — someone with real authority — lay it out like this hits differently. It’s not just one or two questionable calls; it’s a string of unpunished actions stretching across multiple seasons.\nWe back our captain. But if this sort of analysis continues to gain traction, referees might begin overcompensating. One overreaction and we could lose Van Dijk for a crucial game. His leadership is irreplaceable under Arne Slot, especially with younger defenders still finding their footing.\nThe real worry? If refs are letting things slide now, the pendulum might soon swing the other way. And the last thing we need in the business end of the season is retrospective justice or reputational backlash.\nWe’re not calling for leniency or bias — just clarity and consistency. If Van Dijk has crossed the line, let it be judged like anyone else. But let’s not pretend this scrutiny isn’t partly fuelled by rival frustration and media narrative.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

With a commanding 11-point lead at the top of the Premier League, the focus is now on strengthening the squad to ensure long-term success. Jamie Carragher, a respected figure associated with the club, has highlighted a crucial area for improvement that the Reds have historically overlooked.\nLiverpool are set to bid farewell to Darwin Nunez at season’s end, prompting a search for a new striker. However, their needs extend beyond the front line, with positions such as left-back, centre-back, and central midfield also requiring attention. Arne Slot, having taken over the managerial reins from Jurgen Klopp, faces the task of addressing these gaps to maintain Liverpool’s dominant presence in the league.\nWhile analysing a recent match against Fulham, Jamie Carragher reiterated his earlier call from January for Liverpool to acquire a left-sided centre-back capable of doubling as a left-back. This type of player is not just a luxury but a necessity for top clubs aiming to have flexible and robust defensive options. Carragher’s analysis came after Fulham exploited a specific weakness in Liverpool’s defence, which lacks a left-footed centre-back.\n“Reasons Why Fulham have pushed it to Van Dijk is, and something Liverpool have always lacked, is a left-footed centre back,” Carragher said on Sky Sports. This observation underscores the tactical disadvantage Liverpool faces without this type of player, as evidenced by the targeting of Virgil van Dijk’s weaker left side during the game.\nhttps://twitter.com/SkySportsPL/status/1909310383317270713?\nThe search for a left-footed centre-back has seen Liverpool linked with several promising players. Jorrel Hato, a young talent from Ajax, fits the bill perfectly with his ability to play both centre-back and left-back. At just 19 years old, Hato represents both an immediate solution and a future prospect for Liverpool.\nAnother intriguing option is Nico Schlotterbeck from Borussia Dortmund. Known for his versatility and defensive prowess, Schlotterbeck could offer the skillset Carragher has advocated for. While Dortmund is keen on retaining him, Liverpool might still lure the 25-year-old to Anfield if they pursue him aggressively in the summer.\nAs Liverpool gears up for another season under Arne Slot’s guidance, the club’s success in the transfer market this summer will be crucial. Addressing the gaps highlighted by Carragher could be the key to maintaining their position at the summit of English football. With strategic signings, particularly in the defensive line, Liverpool can look forward to continued dominance in the Premier League.\nEnsuring they secure the right talent in the coming months will no doubt be high on Arne Slot’s agenda as he builds on Klopp’s legacy and shapes his own path at Liverpool. The summer transfer window is not just a chance to refresh the squad but an opportunity to strategically position Liverpool for future challenges.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

For Arne Slot’s side, the visit of West Ham is an opportunity to regain momentum in the Premier League title race—and reassert dominance in front of a home crowd.\nThe last time these two sides met, West Ham were drifting towards the inevitable end of Julen Lopetegui’s short and troubled tenure. Six wins from 20 Premier League matches reflected a fractured side short on belief and structure.\nLiverpool, by contrast, were clinical and ruthless during that meeting in East London. Goals from Luis Díaz, Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota wrapped up one of their most convincing performances of the season.\nNow, under Graham Potter, West Ham show signs of structure and resilience, but the table tells a starker truth. With the Hammers currently sitting 16th, and Jarrod Bowen’s eight goals in 27 games their brightest attacking note, this remains a team in flux—one still flirting with danger and lacking any sustained threat.\nAndrew Madley will take charge of Sunday’s match at Anfield. His assistants will be Scott Ledger and Matthew Wilkes, with Tony Harrington as the fourth official.\nVAR responsibilities will be held by John Brooks, and supported by assistant VAR Steven Meredith.\nMadley is a familiar figure for Liverpool fans. He has officiated 18 matches involving the Reds across his career. His most recent appointment was in January 2025, overseeing Liverpool’s 2-0 win at Brentford where a dramatic late brace from Darwin Núñez secured a vital three points.\nSlot’s tactical blueprint this season has been built on control, intensity, and intelligent pressing. Yet, the setback against Fulham revealed how quickly rhythm can falter without cohesion. This West Ham fixture isn’t just about collecting three points—it’s about sharpening transitions, limiting unforced errors, and keeping control of the narrative.\nCrucially, Slot will want a performance free from controversy involving officials. With the Premier League margins now razor-thin, a straightforward win would offer both relief and renewed confidence heading into the final stretch.\nLiverpool remain very much in the title conversation, but every match now carries the weight of consequence. With Arsenal maintaining their lead, Slot knows that nothing less than victory will suffice at Anfield.\nThis isn’t a game for grand statements. It’s a fixture for focus, fundamentals, and fierce determination. And if Liverpool wish to push this title race to the final days, West Ham must be dispatched with the clinical edge that defines champions.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

Pennant echoed this, saying: “First-half Liverpool were miles off it and it is the worst defensive performance of the season that I’ve seen from them this season.”\n“They looked so complacent. Starting with Ibou Konate trying drag-backs in his own box, Virgil [van Dijk] struggled in the first-half and [Andy] Robertson was poor all game,” said Pennant.\nIt’s hard to argue with Pennant’s observations, with all three defenders playing a huge role in all of Fulham’s goals.\nDespite Sunday’s shock defeat though, the former midfielder remains ‘99% sure’ that Liverpool will still wrap up the title. Slot’s side host West Ham United at Anfield on Sunday, which is a huge opportunity to get their title pursuit back on track before travelling to struggling Leicester City the week after.\nDespite Liverpool taking complete control of the Premier League this season, there’s no doubt that Slot can still improve his squad massively in the summer.\nPennant saw Sunday’s disappointing performance as a stark reminder of the work that can be done, saying: “Liverpool can 100% still strengthen this squad in the summer in a number of positions.”\n“Most notably, I think we’ve seen a lot of mistakes from Robertson down that left-side.”\n“He has been a great servant, but I think it’s time that Liverpool look to improve in that area,” said Pennant.\nThe Reds have already been linked with moves for the likes of AFC Bournemouth’s Milos Kerkez and Ajax’s Jorrel Hato ahead of the summer window. Kostas Tsimikas is currently the favourite to leave the club for a new challenge, whilst Robertson could be facing a more rotational role in Slot’s setup from next season.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

Model Brooks Nader, 28, and dancer Gleb Savchenko, 41, were partnered up during season 33 of the competition show — the same season as famed scammer Anna Delvey — and constantly fueled dating rumors after being caught kissing, acting horny in public, and getting tattoos with one another. But now, after six months, it looks like the curtain has closed on their steamy showmance.\nAccording to People, an unnamed source revealed Nader called off their relationship this weekend after suspecting Savchenko had cheated on her. Yikes. He, on the other hand, apparently had no idea their relationship had even ended — in fact, it sounds like Nader ghosted him. Double yikes. “I was surprised to learn through articles published today … that Brooks has ended our relationship,” he told “Page Six” in a statement. “The last communication I received from her was a text on April 6 asking to speak. I called her today in response, but she has not replied.”\nSavchenko said he was last with Nader on March 31 or April 1 in New York — they’d been filming an episode of an untitled reality show starring her and her three sisters. “She was sad to see me leave, but I had to return to DWTS to finish my four-month tour at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood,” he said. “I am still processing everything, and while I don’t have all the answers, I wish Brooks the best moving forward.”\n🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹\nThe former dance partners are both active on TikTok and have seemingly posted response videos to the drama. Nader’s video shows her parents consoling her with the caption “probably needed a hug.” Savchenko’s video, on the other hand, features him winking and lip-syncing to a sound that says, “To everyone who watches my life and gossips about it, don’t give up. Season two is about to come out.” I wonder how Nader feels about that one.\nI’m a lover of love, so I’m hoping this situation is just fodder for Nader’s new reality show.

(ABC News: Keane Bourke)\nA four-month trial of hand-held metal detection wands by Tasmania police ended on April 2.\nA proposed law to crack down on knife crime — Reid's law — is set to pass parliament this week, and will allow police to search someone for a \"dangerous article\" if there is \"reasonable suspicion\" they may be carrying one.\nUnder the proposed legislation, maximum penalties for possessing a dangerous article in a public place would double to $20,000 or three years in prison. The law will be debated by the Legislative Council this week.\nA metal detection wand trial has resulted in \"one in four\" people searched being found to have weapons on them, the Tasmanian government says — ahead of a new laws being considered in parliament.\nThe four-month trial was carried out statewide in targeted areas in a bid to crack down on knife crime.\nTasmania Police said of the 213 searches conducted since December, 54 weapons were seized; 42 of which were knives.\nA display of bladed weapons put on by Tasmania Police. (ABC News)\nPolice said there were 93 searches in Hobart, with 23 \"dangerous articles\" seized. \nLaunceston had 89 searches, with 27 \"dangerous articles\" seized, while in the western district there were 31 searches, with four \"dangerous articles\" seized.\nThe trial allowed Tasmanian police to stop people on \"reasonable suspicion\" to check them for carrying illegal knives. (ABC News: Lucy MacDonald)\nPolice Minister Felix Ellis said the strong results highlighted the need to make the rollout of metal detection wands permanent.\n\"Across the state, one in four searches resulted in the seizure of a weapon,\" Mr Ellis said.\nThe trial is part of broader reforms proposed through Reid's Law, legislation that will expand search powers for Tasmania police to detect weapons, and introduce stronger penalties for those caught carrying them.\nSince her son's death in a stabbing attack in 2019, Laraine Ludwig has campaigned for tougher knife laws in Tasmania. Now, with a trial for police to be able to search for weapons about to begin, she hopes no other family will go through what her's did.\nThe proposed laws allow police to search someone for a \"dangerous article\" if they form a \"reasonable suspicion\" they are carrying one, rather than a \"reasonable ground for belief\" as before, and would make the use of metal detection wands permanent.\nUnder the legislation, maximum penalties for possessing a dangerous article in a public place would double to a $20,000 fine or terms of imprisonment of up to three years.\nThe name Reid's Law is in recognition of Reid Ludwig, a father of two tragically stabbed and killed at a Blackmans Bay service station in 2019, in southern Tasmania.\nTasmania police say 54 weapons were seized during the four-month trial, 42 of which were knives. (ABC News: Lucy MacDonald)\nThe legislation design is similar to Jack's Law in Queensland, named after teenager Jack Beasley who was stabbed to death in 2019.\nThe legislation passed Tasmania's lower house of parliament last week, and is set to be debated in the Legislative Council this week.\nTasmania Police Acting Inspector Danny Jackson said the searches were carried out in populated areas, such as shopping precincts and transport hubs.\nHe said they resulted in a number of arrests, and he was confident it was already working as a deterrent for some.\n\"They will understand that they're going to be searched. They understand that the wand will pick up metal devices, whereas a visual examination will not.\"\nPolice say they don't believe one in four Tasmanians are carrying weapons, more that \"certain demographics\" were caught in the net.\n\n  (ABC News: Lucy MacDonald)\nHowever, Acting Inspector Jackson said while the results were strong, they weren't reflective of the broader community.\n\"We cast this net in these public places where people are likely to gather, and that often means that certain demographics will gather and they're caught up in the net,\" he said.\nActing Inspector Jackson said many of the people caught carrying weapons were young people, who often didn't understand \"the full consequences\" of their actions.\n\"It's very concerning when anybody is carrying a knife, but obviously someone who is less mature than an adult in possession of a knife or a dangerous article in a public place gives us perhaps an extra level of concern.\"\nHe said intervention was also an important aspect to reducing knife crime, to ensure people understood the seriousness \"of what can happen if you're carrying a knife.\"\nTasmanian barrister and Australian Lawyers Alliance spokesperson Greg Barns said he remained opposed to the increase of police powers, labelling the use of metal detection wands as ineffective.\nHe said the weapons seized would only be replaced, and the approach would not address the causes of crime.\n\"The premise of this 'wanding' test is nonsensical,\" Mr Barns said.\n\"It's effectively saying if we take these knives off the street, that's 54 less. That's just nonsense. It simply means that they've policed certain individuals, and targeted particular areas.\"\nMr Barns said to reduce crime, early intervention needed to be the priority.\n\"What works is getting in amongst these communities, working with young people and their peers … and reducing the number of people that are attracted to using knives and possessing knives.\nPolice Minister Felix Ellis said there was \"strong evidence\" the approach worked, citing the number of knives seized interstate since Jack's Law was introduced.\n\"It's also a clear demonstration about why we not only need to increase police powers, but we need to increase penalties on people doing the wrong thing.\"\nMr Ellis said the government was committed to being both \"tough on crime\" and \"tough on the causes of crime, too\", as shown through its investment in programs such as JCP Youth, which supports at-risk youth.\nLIVE\nTopic:Explainer\nTopic:Government and Politics\nAnalysis by Michelle Grattan\nTopic:Child Care\nTopic:Police\nTopic:Laws\nTopic:Secondary Education\nFundamental Rights\nHobart\nLaunceston\nLaws\nPolice\nTAS\nTopic:Floods\nTopic:Explainer\nTopic:Government and Politics\nAnalysis by Michelle Grattan\nTopic:Child Care\nTopic:History\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\nTopic:Road Cycle Racing\nTopic:Child Care\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"}

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead\nAfter years of lamenting the decimation of Facebook referral traffic, some publishers are starting to see that traffic return this year.\nIt’s nothing like the heyday of Facebook referral traffic in the late 2010s. But this new wave of growth is noteworthy, according to five publishing executives.\nFacebook referral traffic quadrupled in March 2025 compared to March 2024, according to Jess Awtry, svp of audience development at Newsweek. She declined to share raw monthly visitor figures. (Newsweek’s referrals from all social platforms are up almost 10 times compared to the average day in March last year, Awtry noted.)\nPolitical news site The Hill had 48 million visits in February, with month-over-month growth up 17%, making it the fastest growing English-language news site for visits, according to the Press Gazette. A big part of that is attributable to a surge in social referral traffic in February and March, said Sarakshi Rai, The Hill’s director of audience development. Facebook referrals in particular have tripled since last year for the publisher, she noted.\n“That has really changed for us,” Rai said. “Social coming back up for us is huge.” (She’s not alone in saying that social referral traffic is having a moment.) Facebook is now starting to “tick up again” to make up about 50% of The Hill’s social referral traffic, she added.\n“There’s been a surge in stories being picked up on Facebook again,” Rai told Digiday.\nNews publisher Salon has seen a 148% increase in page views in the last three months compared to the three months prior, according to Salon’s general manager Amanda Wolfe. “We’re seeing a large corresponding increase in impressions and engagement on Facebook itself,” she said.\nFacebook revenue and referral traffic are up about 30% from their lowest point last November, one publishing exec said during a closed-door town hall session during the Digiday Publishing Summit in Vail, Colorado, in March.\nBut none of the execs interviewed for this story are hanging their hats on the return of Facebook referrals.\nPublishers have a history of being burned by Facebook parent Meta. The platform shut down its Facebook News tab last year, removed Instant Articles in 2023 and de-prioritized content shared by publishers in 2018. These moves have destabilized a lot of audience strategies for publishers over the years, with many still dealing with that challenge through 2023 and 2024.\n“It’s still drastically different than it was two years ago, and certainly different than it was six years ago,” the anonymous publishing exec said during the town hall.\nIt’s important to note that The Hill, Newsweek and Salon are all news outlets, and the fact that they cover politics could be evidence of a “Trump bump,” or a renewed interest in news following the presidential election.\n“I think there’s always interest every time there’s a new president or new administration,”  Rai said. “I think also for news fatigue post-election, now some of that has come back.”\nThe top stories driving people from Facebook to Newsweek’s site are political and economic coverage, Awtry said. At the beginning of this year, Meta said it would bring posts about elections, politics and social issues back into its social feeds after reducing their visibility in 2021.\n“Even a few months ago, any hard news was a non-starter on Facebook,” Awtry said. “No clickthroughs, virtually no engagement. But we’ve been sharing a lot more of our hard news content post-inauguration and algorithm change, and reader interest in it has eclipsed the lifestyle coverage that has dominated for the past couple of years.”\nBut the increase in Facebook referral traffic that these publishers are experiencing is not something that’s happening across the board.\nChartbeat data of 3,800 sites shows that the number of raw page views has increased slightly, but not enough to show a real trend. Meanwhile, Similarweb data of desktop traffic shows Facebook referrals to the top 100 news and media sites were up 9.6% year over year in February (but down 4.75% YoY in January). Traffic was up 4.45% month over month in January and 2.19% in February.\nThose who are seeing an uptick said they haven’t done anything differently on Facebook that would have warranted this initial this surge in referral traffic and engagement on the platform, leading them to believe it’s a change at the platform level.\n“We haven’t done anything different,” Rai said. “We’ve stuck to doing what we’ve always done.”\nMeta did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.\nNewsweek has put more resources into Facebook since the start of this year, after seeing the increase in referral traffic from the platform.\nBut it’s not like publishers have gotten a lot of guidance from Meta, either.\n“We don’t have conversations with anybody about [publisher programs]. All of a sudden [this uptick] just shows up,” the anonymous publishing exec said.\nWhat’s more, a new Friends tab could end up throwing this all for a loop. When Digiday asked two execs what impact that new tab — which only shows posts from friends and family — could have on their referral traffic, their answer boiled down to: we have no idea.\nChatGPT is sending more of its traffic to publishers’ sites.\nGoogle tables proposals to Judge Brinkema, arguing the DOJ’s push for divestiture is unviable ahead of the September 22 remedy phase. \nGenerative AI content farms are stealing publishers’ ads.txt files to hijack ad revenue, according to DoubleVerify.\nGet access to tools and analysis to stay ahead of the trends transforming media and marketing\nVisit your account page to make changes and renew.\nGet Digiday's top stories every morning in your email inbox.\nFollow @Digiday for the latest news, insider access to events and more."}

Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. \nWhen generative AI starts summarizing your content better than your own website, what happens to your traffic — and your revenue model? Jan van der Crabben of World History Encyclopedia is finding out the hard way. His experience is a warning shot to content marketers everywhere: Search isn’t broken, but it’s being rewritten. And it might be time to reimagine how we earn attention online.\nLate last year, Jan van der Crabben’s AI fears materialized. His World History Encyclopedia — the world’s second most visited history website — showed up in Google’s AI Overviews, synthesized and presented alongside other history sites. Then, its traffic cratered, dropping 25% in November.\nVan der Crabben, the website’s CEO and founder, knew he was getting a preview of what many online publishers may soon experience. His site built a sizable audience with plenty of help from Google, which still accounts for 80% of its traffic. But as AI search and bots like ChatGPT ingest and summarize the web’s content, that traffic is starting to disappear. \nNow, his path forward is beginning to look murky.\nRelated Article: Will ChatGPT Search Change Everything in SEO?\n“There used to be this implicit agreement between publishers and Google that basically, Google could scrape, analyze, process and do whatever they wanted with publishers’ content, and, in return, they would send traffic to the publishers, send them readers,” he told me. “Now, this unspoken contract is kind of breaking.”\nWorld History Encyclopedia is just one site, and Van der Crabben’s anecdote is just one story. But the migration of readers from the web to AI summaries will likely continue. The internet has always favored ease. And using generative AI to find the most valuable parts of the web’s evergreen content — like recipes, personal finance and history content — can be a better experience than poking through sites one by one. Along the way, these systems will likely rewrite the economics of the web, and perhaps reshape the internet itself.\nThough a non-profit, World History Encyclopedia sustains itself largely through advertising, which makes up 70% of its revenue. It employs nine people, publishes approximately 10 articles per week, and translates its content into 40+ languages. To run this operation, it places ads next to its articles and depends on search to bring visitors to its pages. As traffic drops, so does revenue, and that throws the site’s ability to keep churning out history articles into question.\nVan der Crabben is well aware that Google has helped him scale in the first place, but what’s different now, he said, is that the arrangement is no longer mutually beneficial. \n“Now it's just Google that benefits,” he said. “And the same is true, let's be honest, for ChatGPT, for Anthropic, for many of the AI chatbots that gobble up the content. And, for most of them, unless you sue them — which only a big corporation like Reuters can do — they are not going to pay you for it.”\nA Google spokesperson said the company sends billions of visits to the web each day and that people using AI Overviews are more satisfied with their results. “Site traffic can change for many reasons, including seasonal demand, interests of users, and regular algorithmic updates to Search,” the spokesperson said. “More broadly, the way people want to consume information is changing, and we're evolving Search to make it easy for people to get a quick answer and also dive deeper on the web.”\nIt’s not just Google that’s featuring World History Encyclopedia’s content. The site has a partnership with Perplexity, which does offer a revenue share model. But others including OpenAI — whose ChatGPT features the site’s content — won’t respond to his emails. OpenAI did not reply to a request for comment.\nAs more people interact with AI products, the quality of AI-generated content could decline if primary sources like World History Encyclopedia can’t fund new content creation. Van der Crabben imagined one scenario where, instead of websites, content creators get paid directly by AI companies to write training content.\n“We will no longer be publishing to readers, but we will just be feeding the machine, and the readers read what the machine gives them,” he said, with a degree of concern. “Who controls the machine? What biases does the machine have? How does this affect the world?”\nRelated Article: Waving Goodbye to SEO: Why AI Visibility Optimization Is the Future\nVan der Crabben, meanwhile, is working to lessen the site’s reliance on search traffic. He’s set up a membership program for instance, which currently has more than 2,000 paying subscribers. He’s thinking about other formats that should be resilient to AI, like book publishing and an app. And he’s not giving up hope:\n“We are taking steps, but nevertheless, the business model that we've had for the last 15 years is — I don't want to say destroyed — but it's being questioned. And so that does make us nervous.”\n Learn how you can join our contributor community.\nAlex Kantrowitz is a writer, author, journalist and on-air contributor for MSNBC.

Here’s how it works.\n\nWith the regrettable Studio Ghbli AI trend in our rearview mirror, we've stumbled right into our next unfortunate AI trend: Action Figures of ourselves.\nTo be clear, I've made one of myself with ChatGPT 4o's new native image capabilities because how could I not? As you might expect, ChatGPT's work is exceptional. I fed OpenAI's GPT 4o model a full-length photo of me and used this prompt:\nCreate an action figure of the person in this photo. It must be in its packaging and with things that represent his interests like computers, robots, cameras, smartphones.\nThe initial results were good, though I neglected to tell ChatGPT to use my name on the packaging. The platform also stumbled a bit when I asked for adjustments to the figure, with each iteration looking less and less like me.\nIt doesn't matter. I did it, and so have thousands of others. At least we're not, as with the Ghibli and Muppets AI memes, stealing someone else's intellectual property (IP) to create new and uncanny images.\n\nI can understand why everyone is doing it. First of all, these images look just like real action figure packaging. The addition of interest accessories and, though I didn't ask for it, an optional head, is perfect.\nThere is a proportional relationship between this quality and how quickly these AI image trends spread. The generative images are so good that as soon as they started to appear on social media, others started investigating how to make one for themselves.\nAI Action Figures in packaging are so popular that there are, unsurprisingly, YouTube tutorials. That's how I figured out how to do it. I found a Spanish-language one created about a week ago. The translation gave me just enough detail to know how to form the proper action figure prompt.\nThis is all good fun, but there are concerns.\nFirst of all, AI image generation is not without cost. Sure, there’s the price of a ChatGPT Plus membership (around $20 / £16 / AU$30 a month), although you can generate around three images a day on the free tier, depending on current demand. Perhaps more importantly, there’s the cost of AI models like 4o.\nA Queens University Library report claims, \"Artificial Intelligence models consume an enormous amount of water and emit large amounts of carbon in their production, training, operation, and maintenance.\" Another Cornell University study calls out AI's growing freshwater use footprint, claiming \"training the GPT-3 language model in Microsoft's state-of-the-art U.S. data centers can directly evaporate 700,000 liters of clean freshwater.\"\nIf you don't think these AI trends and the memes they spawn are attracting wide use, stressing the system, and possibly eating natural resources, just look at OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's comments.\nit's super fun seeing people love images in chatgpt.but our GPUs are melting.we are going to temporarily introduce some rate limits while we work on making it more efficient. hopefully won't be long!chatgpt free tier will get 3 generations per day soon.March 27, 2025\nWe have a joke in my house that every time we create one of these AI memes, it kills a tree. That's hyperbole, of course, but it's safe to say that AI content generation is not without costs, and perhaps we should be thinking about it and using it differently,\nThat is the other question. With so many consumers primarily using AI for trend image generation, are they missing the point?\nThe growing intelligence of AI means that someday in the not-too-distant future it could be as smart or smarter than us (Artificial General intelligence could arrive as soon as next year). Meanwhile, we'll all be using it to create funny movie posters and then shocked when AI takes our jobs.\n\nThe way into AI and perhaps keeping control of the narrative is by using AI as a practical tool. It's not as much fun, but ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Apple Intelligence, and soon Alexa+, all feature myriad tools for improving things we do every day, including writing, creating outlines, polishing presentations, and summarizing long articles. Yes, they can create complete images and short videos, but tools like Adobe Firefly are more helpful for adjusting existing ones in more subtle ways, like removing backgrounds or distracting people and objects.\nThere are people using AIs like ChatGPT 4o for these tasks but those workaday activities are drowned out by a flood of AI trend images and memes like the ones above of my life-like action figure in plastic packaging.\nIt is kind of cool, right?\nIf you drop that action figure image into Sora, you can craft a prompt that depicts it (you) being removed from your packaging.\n\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nA 38-year industry veteran and award-winning journalist, Lance has covered technology since PCs were the size of suitcases and “on line” meant “waiting.” He’s a former Lifewire Editor-in-Chief, Mashable Editor-in-Chief, and, before that, Editor in Chief of PCMag.com and Senior Vice President of Content for Ziff Davis, Inc.

If you're looking for Tuesday's puzzle instead then click here: NYT Connections hints and answers for Tuesday, April 8 (game #667).\nGood morning! Let's play Connections, the NYT's clever word game that challenges you to group answers in various categories. It can be tough, so read on if you need Connections hints.\nWhat should you do once you've finished? Why, play some more word games of course. I've also got daily Strands hints and answers and Quordle hints and answers articles if you need help for those too, while Marc's Wordle today page covers the original viral word game.\nSPOILER WARNING: Information about NYT Connections today is below, so don't read on if you don't want to know the answers.\n\nToday's NYT Connections words are…\nWhat are some clues for today's NYT Connections groups?\nNeed more clues?\nWe're firmly in spoiler territory now, but read on if you want to know what the four theme answers are for today's NYT Connections puzzles…\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWhat are the answers for today's NYT Connections groups?\nRight, the answers are below, so DO NOT SCROLL ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM.\n\nThe answers to today's Connections, game #668, are…\nThank goodness I got the purple group today, as there is no way I would have ever got ANIMALS IN THE WITCHES’ BREW IN “MACBETH” despite all four ingredients being typically witchy.\nBefore all that, though, I made two mistakes trying to get the easiest quartets – thinking BALL, BAT, GLOVE and SOCK belonged together as vital components of baseball.\nIn hindsight, this was a bit silly, so I switched lanes and got a “one away” including bat in the group that would become PUNCH.\nMy muddling through was completed by getting the four words for FOX___ without actually having a clue what the link was until the reveal.

It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult.\nOn the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room.\nIt's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks.

Red arrow over negative ... More financial figures. Digital 3D render.\nI’m getting a lot of folks asking me what to do now the market has crashed. I don’t blame them. The signals – and the situation itself – are wildly unusual.\nA crash is generally accepted to be a drop of 25%. We have had that on the Nasdaq. There are further levels to crashes, and crudely, if you look at the Nasdaq now, they would be 15,000, 10,000, and 5,000. Another way to look at it: -25% and -33% can happen frequently, then -50% and -75% are progressively rarer. For example, -75%+ only happened in 1929 and during the Dotcom crash. It takes a fair bit of disaster to get past -25%, but to be clear, I feel we are in for a lot more. However, that’s just my opinion – and not only can I be wrong, but circumstances can change significantly.\nWe all need a simple guide to how crashes unfold. The “now” is about navigating what comes next. So here are the basics of how a crash pans out.\nHere’s a picture crafted by my own hand and MS Paint:\nThe different shapes to the bottom of a crash\nThis is only extremely obvious when you’re not trying to catch a falling knife and somehow trade your way out of horrible losses. If you study previous crashes, you’ll start to see how things tend to play out. Don’t assume recovery is inevitable or will happen quickly. For example, it took until 1957 for the 1929 crash to recover its previous level. The way to think about the future is to understand what the bottom looked like, when it happened, and where the safest part of the cycle is to re-enter.\nThe V-shaped bottom is very rare. This crash is unlikely to have one.\nYou don’t want to try and catch the first inevitable bounce at the base of the initial fall, because that fabled dip might just be a pause – especially if there appears to be a good reason for the initial drop.\nMost likely, the bottom will be a W, and you can check previous crashes to judge for yourself. A W is simply the next most common form of recovery after the two-step fall and rebound. It’s just a crash and recovery with an extra step – more plausible than a clean V.\nThe following piece of naïve graphic design has served me well for a couple of decades:\nAvoid the dead cat bounce and buy when the market is starting to recover\nBy buying the last leg of the W, you avoid buying into a fall that’s only halfway down – the classic danger of “catching a falling knife.”\nYou’ve likely read my articles warning of this crash, so now for me it’s about re-entering at the right time and place. That’s as tough as getting out near the top. Pundits like to say it’s not possible, and maybe my luck in doing so over the years here on Forbes is just a happy fluke.\nMy observations are:\nI’m not fan of the 3D chess players and prefer to let the hive mind of the markets judge reality for me and communicate the true situation. As such, I’ll watch for the next leg down and let the market tell me if I’m right or wrong.\nSo here is a map:\nThe Nasdaq: a map of what to watch out for\nYou know I like to keep it annoyingly simple. The tariff dynamic should be priced in by now. You can see this setback puts us back on a trend from 2016-2017, which is sustainable under the right circumstances. Without any more madness, the market should trend normally from here. Volatility should cool, and then a new trend – whatever it may be – should begin.\nHowever…\nMore madness, and down we go.\nI won’t trade hope. I’ll be buying the last leg of the W."}

Big wins, financial freedom, public recognition. The very markers many dream of achieving. But reach those heights and you'll find a surprising reality. The ladder of success often leads to isolation, creating a gap between you and the people around you.\nYour problems change, your peer group shifts, and finding genuine connection becomes a bigger challenge than hitting revenue targets ever was.\nI speak to entrepreneurs at every stage of their journey. After selling my own social media agency in 2021, I noticed a pattern among those who've \"made it.\" While these founders had achieved what they once dreamed of, many confessed to feeling unexpectedly alone at the summit. Their connections had weakened while their achievements grew.\nBut isolation isn't success's inevitable companion. With intentional effort, you can build genuine connections that match your professional altitude.\nSuccess creates distance in surprising ways. Your daily challenges become unrelatable to most people. While friends worry about paying their rent, you're negotiating acquisition offers. Your problems sound like humble brags even when they're genuinely difficult.\nYour time also becomes increasingly precious. Every hour spent on connection feels like an hour not spent on the next level. You start to filter social invitations, evaluate them against business priorities, and often choose work. Thisdrift happens so gradually you barely notice until suddenly your circle has shrunk dramatically.\nThe safety to be vulnerable disappears too. When people see you as \"the successful one,\" sharing struggles feels risky. You become the person others turn to for advice, not the one asking for help. The expectation to have everything figured out grows with each achievement until your public image traps you.\nIf this resonates: congratulations. You’ve reached a level of success that most people never do. Here’s how to stop it from being lonely.\nTrue connection comes from spending time with people who understand your reality. Actively seek relationships with entrepreneurs at similar levels. Join mastermind groups, business communities, or investment circles where your challenges are normal conversation topics.\nIf you’re the smartest person in the room, find a different room. Look for people who won't be impressed by your achievements but can relate to them. Find spaces where you can drop the mask, discuss real concerns, and get feedback from those who comprehend the stakes.\nSuccess becomes your identity when all relationships centre on your business prowess. Deliberately place yourself in environments where you're a beginner again. Take up completely new skills, join groups where your business success carries no weight, and enjoy the freedom of not being the authority.\nWhen I compete in powerlifting competitions, nobody there cares about my Forbes articles or business milestones. The humility of being coached and the joy of progress in a different domain creates connections based on shared experience rather than hierarchy.\nDeep connection requires protected space. Schedule it with the same commitment you give to important business meetings. Block your calendar for relationship building and defend it against encroachment.\nCreate rituals that enforce this boundary. Perhaps Friday dinners with family are non-negotiable. Maybe Sunday mornings belong to friends. Every day at 2pm you exercise with your trainer. Whatever you choose, make it regular enough to become sacred in your schedule.\nRelationships deepen when vulnerability flows both ways. But as the more outwardly successful person, you might need to go first. With the right people; share your real challenges, not just your wins. Ask for help, don’t just give it. Demonstrate that imperfection is welcome in your world.\nStart small with trusted individuals who get your vibe. Explain your uncertainty about a decision. Admit when something feels difficult. Each vulnerable disclosure creates permission for others to meet you as a person, not a success story.\nMeaningful bonds get missed when your mind constantly drifts to business concerns. Practice giving people your complete attention without checking notifications or mentally preparing for your next meeting. Put your phone away; you’re not the president.\nDevelop transition rituals between work and personal time. A short walk, a change of clothes, or simply closing your laptop can signal to your brain that you're shifting focus. The quality of your presence determines the depth of your relationships.\nDon’t hit all your goals only to find you have no one left to celebrate with. Keep the right people around to share in your achievements and support you through setbacks. Treat connection as seriously as you treat business growth.\nSuccess can feel like a lonely peak or an enjoyable journey depending on how much intention you apply to relationships. Combine success with connection to never feel lonely again."}

By using its built-in features, you can streamline your daily tasks, minimize distractions, and optimize your workflow. In the video below from Proper Honest Tech, we get to find out about ten iPhone Productivity tips to help you unlock the full potential of your iPhone and make your day more efficient.\n Watch this video on YouTube.\nNotifications can disrupt your focus and derail your productivity. Fortunately, iOS offers robust tools to manage them effectively. From the Notification Center, swipe left on any notification, tap “Options,” and select whether to mute it for an hour, mute it for the day, or disable notifications for that app entirely. By customizing which alerts you receive, you can ensure that only the most important notifications demand your attention, helping you maintain focus and reduce unnecessary interruptions.\nThe Notes app is a powerful tool for organizing ideas, but navigating through folders can be time-consuming. The “Recent Notes” feature simplifies this process. Tap the back button in the Notes app to instantly view a list of your most recently accessed notes. This feature is particularly helpful when you’re managing multiple projects or jotting down ideas on the go, allowing you to seamlessly switch between notes without losing momentum.\nFilling out forms or entering repetitive information can be tedious, but the autofill feature in iOS makes it effortless. When prompted to enter details like your name, address, or email, tap the autofill option to populate the fields automatically using your saved information. This feature not only saves time but also reduces the likelihood of errors, making it a valuable tool for both personal and professional tasks.\nYour iPhone’s visual intelligence capabilities, powered by advanced machine learning, can provide valuable insights from your photos. Open the Photos app, select an image, and tap the information icon to identify objects, landmarks, or text within the image. For even more detailed analysis, apps like Google Lens can offer additional context and information. This feature is particularly useful for research, learning, or solving everyday questions, making your iPhone a powerful assistant in both work and leisure.\nWhen someone mentions a specific time in a message or email, iOS automatically underlines it. By tapping the underlined time, you can preview your calendar to check your availability without leaving the app. You can even add the event directly to your calendar from this view. This seamless integration eliminates the need to switch between apps, helping you stay organized and maintain your workflow.\nIf you come across an article or webpage you’d like to save for future reference, you can easily convert it into a PDF using Safari. Tap the share icon, select “Save to Files,” and choose the PDF format. Once saved, you can store the document in the Notes app, iCloud, or another location for easy access. This feature is ideal for offline reading, research, or archiving important information, making sure you always have access to the content you need.\nThe Reminders app includes a feature called smart lists, which automatically organizes tasks based on criteria such as due dates, tags, or priority levels. To create a smart list, tap “Add List,” select “Make into Smart List,” and set your desired filters. This feature consolidates tasks from multiple lists into a single, organized view, making it easier to prioritize and manage your responsibilities effectively.\nSharing task lists or project plans is simple with the ability to export reminders as PDFs. Open a list in the Reminders app, tap the share icon, and choose “Print.” From the print preview, select “Save as PDF” to generate a file. This feature is particularly useful for sharing non-editable to-do lists with colleagues, collaborators, or friends, making sure everyone stays on the same page.\niOS’s drag-and-drop functionality allows you to link files, emails, or photos directly to reminders. For example, you can drag an email from the Mail app and drop it into a reminder to create a direct link. This feature keeps all relevant information in one place, making it easier to stay organized and making sure that important details are always accessible when you need them.\nMultitasking is more efficient with iOS’s quick app-switching gesture. By swiping left or right along the home indicator at the bottom of your screen, you can move between recently used apps without returning to the home screen. This feature saves time and keeps your workflow uninterrupted, allowing you to focus on the task at hand.\nYour iPhone is equipped with a wide range of features designed to simplify your life and boost your productivity. By mastering tools like notification management, autofill, and smart lists, you can streamline your tasks and focus on what truly matters. Whether you’re organizing your schedule, conducting research, or managing projects, these tips can help you work more efficiently and effectively. Start incorporating them into your routine today to experience the full benefits of your iPhone’s capabilities.\nEnhance your knowledge of iPhone productivity tips by exploring a selection of articles and guides on the subject.\nSource & Image Credit: Proper Honest Tech\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\n\nDisclosure: Some of our articles include affiliate links.

Such materials have been difficult to find because those two effects are typically mutually exclusive. Now Lucas Pupim and Mathias Scheurer at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, propose an innovative way to engineer these materials [1]. They show theoretically that the approach could be used to realize altermagnetic superconductivity, an exotic phenomenon with potential applications in spin-based electronics.\nIn the new method, the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope is used to create a periodic arrangement of nonmagnetic atoms on the surface of an unconventional superconductor. This type of superconductor was chosen because it naturally features multiple competing mechanisms of superconductivity, providing a rich and tunable platform. The presence of the nonmagnetic atoms generates circulating electric currents and associated magnetic moments, inducing the desired magnetic superconductivity. In the specific example studied by the researchers, these magnetic moments exhibit altermagnetism, a recently identified fundamental form of magnetism (see Viewpoint: Altermagnetism Then and Now). Altermagnetism combines the spin-dependent electronic properties of ferromagnetism with the zero net magnetization of antiferromagnetism.\nPupim and Scheurer show that such altermagnetic superconductivity could have three main signatures: a specific magnetic-field pattern, a specific spin pattern associated with electrons in the superconductor’s lattice, and a nonzero value for a geometric quantity known as the Berry quadrupole moment. As a result, the phenomenon could be detected in the lab via magnetic-field measurements, spin-sensitive photoemission spectroscopy, and heat-transport experiments that probe the Berry quadrupole moment. The researchers say that their technique could be applied to a variety of unconventional superconductors to learn more about these materials and to potentially realize other exotic superconducting states.\n–Ryan Wilkinson\nRyan Wilkinson is a Corresponding Editor for Physics Magazine based in Durham, UK.\nLucas V.

To better days!”\n— T.F. Hodge\nStruggling to find your motivation? Feeling unsure or uneasy about the next steps?\nThere are just a few things you need to know right now.\nThis quick read is for YOU…\nOnce upon a time there was a woman in her mid-sixties who noticed that she had lived her entire life in the same small town. And although she had spent decades enthusiastically dreaming about traveling and seeing the world, she had never taken a single step to make this dream a reality.\nFinally, she woke up on the morning of her 65th birthday and decided that now was the time! She sold all of her possessions except for some essential items she needed, packed these items into a backpack, and began her journey out into the world. The first several days on the road were amazing and filled with awe — with every step forward she felt like she was finally living the life she had dreamed.\nBut a few short weeks later, the days on the road started taking a toll on her. She felt misplaced and she missed the familiar comforts of her old life. As her feet and legs grew more and more sore with each new step, her mood also took a turn for the worse.\nEventually she stopped walking, took off her backpack, slammed it on the ground, and sat down beside it as tears began streaming down her cheeks. She stared hopelessly down a long winding road that once led to an amazing world, but now seemed to lead only to discomfort and unhappiness. “I have nothing! I have nothing left in my life!” she shouted out loud at the top of her lungs.\nCoincidentally, a renowned guru and life adviser from a nearby village was resting quietly behind a pine tree adjacent to where the woman was sitting. When the woman began shouting, the guru heard every word and he felt it was his duty to help her. Without thinking twice, he jumped out from behind the pine tree, grabbed her backpack, and ran into the forest that lined both sides of the road. Stunned and in complete disbelief, the woman started crying even harder than before, to the point of near breathlessness.\n“That backpack was all I had,” she cried.” And now it’s gone! Now everything is gone in my life!”\nAfter roughly ten minutes of much-needed tears, the woman gradually collected her emotions, stood up again and began staggering slowly down the road. Meanwhile the guru cut through the forest and secretly placed the backpack in the middle of the road just a short distance ahead of the woman.\nWhen the woman’s teary eyes fell upon the backpack, she almost couldn’t believe what she was seeing — everything she thought she had just lost was once again right in front of her. She couldn’t help but smile from ear to ear. “Oh, thank heavens!” the woman exclaimed. “I am so grateful! Now I definitely have what I need to continue onward…”\nAs we journey through our personal and professional lives, there will inevitably be periods of incredible frustration and despair. During those tough times, it will sometimes appear to us that we’ve lost everything, and that nothing and nobody could possibly motivate us to move onward in the direction of our dreams. But just like the woman who stumbled across the guru, we are all holding with us a backpack of support that comes in many forms — it can be a simple DM or text message from someone we respect, inspiring blog posts, insightful books, helpful neighbors, supportive communities, and so much more.\nWhen the going gets tough — when we’re losing our motivation and feeling down and unsure of everything — we need to wake ourselves up and remember…\nIf you are struggling right now, you’ve got this!\nNo matter your circumstances, you always have what you need to take the next smallest step.\nOr as Epicurus so profoundly said, “Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.”\nBe mindful. Be present. Keep going, one day at a time, one small step at a time.\nPlease leave a comment below and let us know:\nWhat’s one source of hope, motivation, or gratitude you typically turn to when you need it most?\nAnything else to share about this essay?\nAngel and I would love to hear from YOU. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂\nFinally, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week.\n\nCynthia says \nApril 8, 2025 at 5:56 am\nI was just forwarded this article by someone I often turn to in times of struggle, or when I’m in a bewildered state. I thanked him for this new tool for my tool box. It turned out to be a whole backpack of enlightenment. The name of the woman in that story, in my life, is Cynthia — me. She is a work in progress. Thanks for sharing such supporting words today. They helped me.\n\nPhyllis Humphrey says \nApril 8, 2025 at 11:17 am\nYour messages have so highlighted my days. I am 74, and needing to make some changes in my life, moving me forward with new hope an motivation. Thank you.\n\nDania Lynne says \nApril 8, 2025 at 6:04 am\nMarc and Angel,\nYour essays and emails are such an inspiration. I am at a crossroads in life and am not sure which direction to take. Your writings provide me with motivation to not sit down in the road, but instead to take those small yet important daily steps. Thank you, as always.\n\ndi says \nApril 8, 2025 at 6:17 am\nThank you.  Your letters are unfailingly inspiring.  One particular sentence really hit home for me.  I am at present almost decided to sell my house (downsizing) from the house in the city where I currently live.  For a long time I wanted to live in this space more than anything else in the world.  There’s a lot of other things;  it’s been a city where I’ve lived the dream’, working at a university and having a full life.  Circumstances changed and at 74 and I’m now living alone.  Although I still have my house the city is so full of memories – and the house too – that I feel I have moved on.  My life has been rich and I have travelled, but the urge to start fresh – to move closer to my family is really strong.  I always vowed I’d never move to be close to either of my children.  I feared being too dependent on them.    It’s really such a difficult situation, but your letter made me think slightly differently.  I just don’t quite know what to do.  But I think that’s okay for now.\n\nSue Campbell says \nApril 8, 2025 at 9:16 am\nI can so relate to your current situation. I am 72 and on my own. I sold a lovely Florida home and a beautiful Michigan beach home. I decided I could no longer manage the two homes so far apart. I moved closer to one of my three children. That has proven to be an issue with my kids, sibling rivalry never ends. I feel I caused the problem. I am frustrated, feeling like I can’t quite settle in. I have had many losses the last few years too, from devastating personal deaths to noticeable changes in my body not being able to be totally independent. I find it difficult to be positive and have a reason to get up on some days, and yet I know I must. Anyway, your comment made me feel less alone right now. So thanks.\n\nDani says \nApril 8, 2025 at 7:57 am\nIt’s funny how I stumbled on this article in the mist of dealing with uncertainty.  I am finding it difficult to keep going some days.  I have been recovering from burnout recently but I have a lot who depends on me (husband, kids, parents, and work), and I love my family but I find myself feeling like I cannot give anymore. Thanks for reminding me of the “small steps” I can take today.\n\nEd Alder says \nApril 8, 2025 at 8:27 am\nThank you guys!!! Reading these suggestions colors my daily life so beautifully – keep things in perspective. At 77, I’ve done a lot of living…and I’m trying to look forward to whatever the future holds.\n\nLee Ann says \nApril 8, 2025 at 8:59 am\nThe entire first part of the story about a woman is ME.  I endlessly dreamed of seeing the places that thrilled me inside before I died. At 65, I realized that I don’t need them. Places are different but people worldwide are all the same: same needs, same desires, same endless searching and all we ever needed to be was thankful and satisfied with the marvelous things and people we share all our lives. Thank you for the reminder as well as sage advice. You are true gems!\n\nSusan H. says \nApril 8, 2025 at 9:09 am\nTotally agree with you!\n\nAndrea Gerardi says \nApril 8, 2025 at 9:00 am\nA good reminder to be grateful for what we have but also to have courage to make necessary changes. There are times when our decisions may not be the best. We have to learn to be compassionate with ourselves and continue to move forward. Just one step in the right direction for me today…\n\nShelley Jeffers says \nApril 8, 2025 at 9:14 am\nI am amazed at how many of us are in the same basic situations. Getting to be 70 in 2 months has been bothering me. I don’t want to be 70 and I don’t want to be old. None of us do. My husband is losing some of his memory and ability to work things out. I am working full-time and that keeps me getting up in the morning. Retirement is not in the equation at the moment. I lived my dream, buying land and a horse and for the last 20 years that has kept me going, but my horse is gone and the land is empty. I know there is something on the horizon, but do not have any idea what it is right now. Thanks for encouragement.\n\nFaye says \nApril 8, 2025 at 9:21 am\nMy husband and I recently retired, sold our home in Wisconsin and moved to Arizona. We took a minimal amount of things and gave away the rest to our kids and donated for good causes.\nIt’s been a year now and I’m having problems with doubts and questioning why I ever left the familiar. I question myself every day but promised my husband (and myself) to give this new move a chance. \nI’m having problems leaving my house (for the first time in my life) just to go out to eat. \nI have been reading your writings for a couple months now which really resonate with me.  I’m getting ready to go out to eat as we speak, my heart is pounding, BUT I can do this after reading your writing today especially!\nThank You!\nFaye\n\nMorna Burdon says \nApril 8, 2025 at 9:27 am\nI am 74. Lived happily in my Victorian flat for 40 years.  Last 3 a nightmare with neighbors – noise, damage, unkindness.  My son lives 500 miles away with new wife, home, baby. I am at a crossroads with decisions to make, but not sure what to do yet. Somehow this short read and the comments above helped me today. Thank you all.\n\nDeidre Cyprian says \nApril 8, 2025 at 10:11 am\nLife has thrown various challenges at me lately, so this came right on time.\n\nPatricia Jones Trent says \nApril 8, 2025 at 10:17 am\nI want to just say Thank you for your encouragements!\nAmen!\n\nCO CC says \nApril 8, 2025 at 11:42 am\nYou guys always seem to send the most important emails just when I need them!! I’m right in the middle of the same kind of situation. Thank you “gurus”!\n\nLiz says \nApril 9, 2025 at 1:01 am\nHi and thank you. I have had a mostly difficult life, with many challenges. Have no family left and am a target for bullying and being taken advantage of. I do need a new start and hope that I can slowly start to do even simple things, again. This has been extremely challenging, especially without support. Have been deciding on constructive ways to try to tell the ones who criticize and who have neglected and abandoned me, how this hurts and how it has adversely affected me. I know that I have a lot fewer resources than most, but have fought through so much, almost completely alone. I am going to strive to make better decisions and smart changes. \nKudos, to the woman who went out to eat and to those who bravely moved out of state. I have only a few occasions, to go to lunch or to socialize, but am also trying to look for part-time work. These inspiring stories give me a modicum of support, am I am grateful, for it.\n\nNicole Svenson says \nApril 8, 2025 at 8:53 pm\nThank you. I needed to hear this. I have always turned to music to help me cope.\n\nLynn macdonald says \nApril 9, 2025 at 12:23 pm\nThis article hit home for me.\nI’m 62 years old, recently laid off, and need to work to cover my obligations.\nI believe in my passions of sewing, and crafting,  and feel once I focus on doing what I love more often, my situation may change.\nI always thought if my passions as JUST hobbies, now I am realizing and believe that I can myself make a change in life by focusing on my passions as part time work…more than JUST hobbies.\nThanks to your Inspiration.\nLove\nLynn\nYour email address will not be published.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nBy now, you’ve heard of the U.S.’s decision to levy tariffs on imports—all goods made in China, as well as select materials worldwide, like steel and aluminum. And recently, yet additional taxes on products from all countries were imposed in early April. Many items now face a minimum 10 percent tariff, with those from China spiking to an unprecedented 54 percent. Hefty fees will fall upon Taiwanese and Vietnamese-made items, too (32 and 46 percent, respectively, with an exception for Taiwan’s semiconductors). More tariffs are proposed for the future as well.\nI covered the details about these tariffs in a FAQ, as well as a set of highlights for a shorter way to get up to speed on the situation. I also created a breakout of sample cost increases so you could better see what actual purchases could look like.\nBut most news has focused on the immediate dollars-and-cents effect of these new taxes. What’s been talked about less are the other ways tariffs will impact the tech industry—consequences that could dampen or even drive back certain aspects that we currently take for granted. At best, we’ll see a temporary blow. At worst, we could feel this hit for years to come.\nTechnology has become more available to the masses over time. Long ago, personal computers were a rare luxury, found only in homes of enthusiasts or the well-to-do. But as popularity rose, devices and hardware became easier to get. People wanted to spend their money on fresh gear—and so supply became more plentiful.\nBrad Chacos / Foundry\nBut when prices go up, demand goes down. Companies already have an incentive to slow the rollout of new products due to the economic instability brought about by the tariffs. If you add on a weakened appetite from consumers for discretionary purchases, vendors have reason to pull back on the production. They may become slower to release successors to products or even a wider variety of products. In particular, smaller companies decide to pause or stop product lines. \nIndustry insiders expressed this very sentiment to me when discussing the tariffs and their effect. Without the ability to make accurate forecasts, businesses have to proceed with more caution. They’ll either produce less of their usual devices or hardware—or opt out of selling certain items altogether.\nAfter years of ever-growing options for consumers, shrinking down to fewer choices will be a sad step backward.\nAdam Patrick Murray / Foundry\nInnovation and competition help lower costs for technology. Manufacturing becomes more efficient, growing demand spreads production costs over a wider field, and/or the tech is succeeded by something even fresher.\nBut if tech gear becomes less varied and harder to get, those factors won’t be as dependable as an influence on price. How much you’ll pay for a laptop, phone, or piece of hardware will likely stick where it is—or go up. As my colleague Gordon Mah Ung loved to point out, Intel sold consumers 4-core, 8-thread CPUs for years, always at similar MSRPs. And when Team Blue launched its first 10-core processor, the suggested price was a staggering $1,723.\nFast forward a year, after AMD released its first generation of Ryzen chips, and Intel’s top consumer chip had inched up in core count, with the $359 Intel Core i7-8700K sporting 6 cores and 12 threads. Its closest rivals? The $329 Ryzen 7 1700 and $399 Ryzen 7 1700X, both of which sported 8 cores and 16 threads.\nThis history lesson shows that consumers get less value when fewer options exist. Companies can charge whatever they want when faced with less pressure to keep pushing the envelope.\nLuke Baker\nIf you’re a company facing economic uncertainty, how much would you want to invest in different products? Likewise, if you’re a consumer looking at devices with fewer or smaller upgrades that cost as much as the previous model, will you want to buy anything new?\nIt’s a bit of a standoff, and one that the tariffs could spark. For example, let’s say you’re used to buying a replacement phone every two years. But if the features don’t change dramatically, and prices remain high (especially for flagship models), perhaps you’ll stick to what you’ve already got in your pocket. Companies might then not push novel form factors as hard, like tri-fold phones and other variants.\nSimilarly, Nvidia and AMD could continue to delay their attention to budget gamers, instead choosing to focus on graphics cards that will bring in more cash. Sure, Intel is the lone holdout for the budget range, but its market share remains low, and its launches aren’t as regular. Budget gamers might then continue to hold out, biding their time with progressively lower graphics settings and frame rates. (But real talk, if your GTX 970 still does it for you, keep rocking that GPU until its well-deserved retirement.)\nSo while engineers will continue to announce newer protocols and standards (think Wi-Fi 7 or PCIe 7.0), the time to an actual launch may be much further in the future than we’re used to. And that pace change could feel like a screeching halt compared to the boom of the past couple of decades, depending on how big a slowdown is.\nMichael Schwarzenberger / Pixabay\nUntil recent years, technology’s progress also often resulted in a predictable routine for prices, too. Current devices got cheaper, and the stuff that replaced them often stayed the same price or even lowered, thanks to improved manufacturing or higher demand.\nBefore the tariffs, that reliability in pricing trends started to waver due to factors like rising production costs. And now with these additional taxes dropped on top, we consumers may no longer be able to trust in steady pricing.\nFirst, as companies shift manufacturing locations, their logistical costs will increase. But how much is still to be determined, based on resources (e.g., new staff hiring, training, etc.) and the ability for a business to absorb current tariff costs. Some larger corporations may take a hit in an effort to keep their part of the industry more stable, for example.\nAdditional tariffs could also cause sudden changes to MSRPs. Given how the current U.S. import tariffs are being enacted, more will likely be announced abruptly as well, with a notice of just a few days.\nEVGA\nThe prospect of new tariffs looms large, too—in February, the U.S. executive branch proposed a 25 percent tariff on all semiconductors, with the intent to sharply raise the tax over time. More recently, a 25 percent tariff on copper was suggested. (You’ll find copper in circuit boards, wiring, and a lot more related to tech.) If these tariffs stack on top of the now 54 percent (!) laid on all Chinese-made goods, you could see a sharp rise in costs for products with multiple components affected by these additional taxes.\nAnother wrinkle: When I last spoke with industry insiders, multiple sources told me they were still learning exactly how the tariffs would be applied. So they themselves are scrambling to adjust and adapt.\nFinally, if costs go up and availability decreases (as discussed above), you may have more trouble predicting actual retail prices. Street prices could go a bit wild, too. We can look at the GPU market for a glimpse into that chaotic, terrible universe: Few cards are available at the announced price, and any remaining stock is higher due to partner cards adding on extras. Any other cards are only available through resellers at huge markups.\nBefore the pandemic, you could easily shop for devices and hardware, with the expectation of regular sales or discounts. Now surplus budgeting may be a requirement whenever you’re preparing for a new purchase. And you may have to go far longer between replacement or upgrades.\nA 14-year veteran of technology and video games journalism, Alaina Yee covers a variety of topics for PCWorld.

He’d been reading articles at TomDispatch, the website I set up soon after the 9/11 attacks to deal with this country’s Global War on Terror, especially the invasions of, and then never-ending conflicts in Afghanistan and later Iraq. As a former military man, he had been struck by the staggering rows of medals and ribbons our military commanders leading this country in those disastrous wars displayed on their uniforms. Unbelievably, they had significantly more of them than our victorious generals in World War II!\nHe commented on how those bemedaled losers reminded him of bemedaled Russian generals in the years before the Soviet Union collapsed and considered their Soviet-style chestfuls of medals and ribbons a sign of our military’s self-delusion amid its disastrous wars. His note caught my attention and I did something rare for me when it came to over-the-transom requests to write for TomDispatch and instantly responded, urging him to consider doing a piece on the subject. He promptly did so, beginning it this way: “It’s time to save the military from itself” – a phrase that seems no less appropriate in 2025 than it did in 2007.\nHe then asked a question that was too seldom considered in the American mainstream media: “Why are we spilling blood and treasure with such reckless abandon?” And he was struck by another all-too-strange reality, considering how poorly America’s wars were already going. He wrote: “In a country founded on civilian control of the military, it’s disturbing indeed that, as a New York Times/CBS poll indicated recently, Americans trust their generals three times as much as Congress and 13 times as much as the president.”\nAnd so it’s gone in these disastrous years of the never-quite-ending Global War on Terror. More than a decade and a half and 110 TomDispatch pieces later, Astore’s new book of those articles, American Militarism on Steroids: The Military-Industrial Complex, Unbounded, Uncontained, and Undemocratic, explores what it meant for the Pentagon and the military to essentially run off the rails of history and take the rest of us with them.\nHonestly, I suspect the age of Donald Trump would have been inconceivable had that military not run off just about every rail in sight at a cost, both literal and figurative, almost beyond imagining. In doing so, it devastated Afghanistan and Iraq – and, in some strange fashion, this country, too. It’s both a tale from hell and a hell of a tale, one that might have seemed like part of an outlandish science fiction novel, had it not actually happened. ~ Tom Engelhardt\nby William Astore\nI read the news today, oh boy. About a lucky man named Elon Musk. But he lost out on one thing: he didn’t get a top secret briefing on Pentagon war plans for China. And the news people breathed a sigh of relief.\nWith apologies to John Lennon and The Beatles, a day in the life is getting increasingly tough to take here in the land of the free. I’m meant to be reassured that Musk didn’t get to see America’s top-secret plans for – yes! – going to war with China, even as I’m meant to ignore the constant drumbeat of propaganda, the incessant military marches that form America’s background music, conveying the message that America must have war plans for China, that indeed war in or around China is possible, even probable, in the next decade. Maybe in 2027?\nMy fellow Americans, we should be far more alarmed by such secret U.S. war plans, along with those “pivots” to Asia and the Indo-Pacific, and the military base-building efforts in the Philippines, than reassured by the “good news” that Comrade Billionaire Musk was denied access to the war room, meaning (for Dr. Strangelove fans) he didn’t get to see “the big board.”\nIt’s war, war, everywhere in America. We do indeed have a strange love for it. I’ve been writing for TomDispatch for 18 years now – this is my 111th essay (the other 110 are in a new book of mine) – most of them focusing on militarism in this country, as well as our disastrous wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, the ruinous weapons systems we continue to fund (including new apocalyptic nuclear weapons), and the war song that seems to remain ever the same.\nA few recent examples of what I mean: President Trump has already bombed Yemen more than once. He’s already threatening Iran. He’s sending Israel all the explosives, all the weaponry it needs to annihilate the Palestinians in Gaza (so too, of course, did Joe Biden). He’s boasting of building new weapons systems like the Air Force’s much-hyped F-47 fighter jet, the “47” designation being an apparent homage by its builder, Boeing, to Trump himself, the 47th president. He and his “defense” secretary, Pete Hegseth, continually boast of “peace through strength,” an Orwellian construction that differs little from “war is peace.” And I could, of course, go on and on and on and on…\nOccasionally, Trump sounds a different note. When Tulsi Gabbard became the director of national intelligence, he sang a dissonant note about a “warmongering military-industrial complex.” And however haphazardly, he does seem to be working for some form of peace with respect to the Russia-Ukraine War. He also talks about his fear of a cataclysmic nuclear war. Yet, if you judge him by deeds rather than words, he’s just another U.S. commander-in-chief enamored of the military and military force (whatever the cost, human or financial).\nConsider here the much-hyped Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by that lucky man Elon Musk. Even as it dismantles various government agencies like the Department of Education and USAID, it has – no surprise here! – barely touched the Pentagon and its vast, nearly trillion-dollar budget. In fact, if a Republican-controlled Congress has any say in the matter, the Pentagon budget will likely be boosted significantly for Fiscal Year 2026 and thereafter. As inefficient as the Pentagon may be (and we really don’t know just how inefficient it is, since the bean counters there keep failing audit after audit, seven years running), targeted DOGE Pentagon cuts have been tiny. That means there’s little incentive for the generals to change, streamline their operations, or even rethink in any significant fashion. It’s just spend, spend, spend until the money runs out, which I suppose it will eventually, as the national debt soars toward $37 trillion and climbing.\nEven grimmer than that, possibly, is America’s state of mind, our collective zeitgeist, the spirit of this country. That spirit is one in which a constant state of war (and preparations for more of the same) is accepted as normal. War, to put it bluntly, is our default state. It’s been that way since 9/11, if not before then. As a military historian, I’m well aware that the United States is, in a sense, a country made by war. It’s just that today we seem even more accepting of that reality, or resigned to it, than we’ve ever been. What gives?\nRemember when, in 1963, Alabama Governor George Wallace said, “Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever”? Fortunately, after much struggle and bloodshed, he was proven wrong. So, can we change the essential American refrain of war now, war tomorrow, and war forever? Can we render that obsolete? Or is that too much to hope for or ask of America’s “exceptional” democracy?\nTaking on the MICIMATT(SH)\nFormer CIA analyst Ray McGovern did America a great service when he came up with the acronym MICIMATT, or the Military-Industrial-Congressional-Intelligence-Media-Academia-Think-Tank complex, an extension of President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s military-industrial complex, or MIC (from his farewell speech in 1961). Along with the military and industry (weapons makers like Boeing and Lockheed Martin), the MICIMATT adds Congress (which Eisenhower had in his original draft speech but deleted in the interest of comity), the intelligence “community” (18 different agencies), the media (generally highly supportive of wars and weapons spending), academia (which profits greatly from federal contracts, especially research and development efforts for yet more destructive weaponry), and think tanks (which happily lap up Pentagon dollars to tell us the “smart” position is always to prepare for yet more war).\nYou’ll note, however, that I’ve added a parenthetical SH to McGovern’s telling acronym. The S is for America’s sporting world, which eternally gushes about how it supports and honors America’s military, and Hollywood, which happily sells war as entertainment (perhaps the best known and most recent film being Tom Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick, in which an unnamed country that everyone knows is Iran gets its nuclear ambitions spanked by a plucky team of U.S. Naval pilots). A macho catchphrase from the original Top Gun was “I feel the need – the need for speed!” It may as well have been: I feel the need – the need for pro-war propaganda!\nYes, MICIMATT(SH) is an awkward acronym, yet it has the virtue of capturing some of the still-growing power, reach, and cultural penetration of Ike’s old MIC. It should remind us that it’s not just the military and the weapons-makers who are deeply invested in war and – yes! – militarism. It’s Congress; the CIA; related intel “community” members; the mainstream media (which often relies on retired generals and admirals for “unbiased” pro-war commentary); academia (consider how quickly institutions like Columbia University have bent the knee to Trump); and think tanks – in fact, all those “best and brightest” who advocate for war with China, the never-ending war on terror, war everywhere.\nBut perhaps the “soft power” of the sporting world and Hollywood is even more effective at selling war than the hard power of bombs and bullets. National Football League coaches patrol the sidelines wearing camouflage, allegedly to salute the troops. Military flyovers at games celebrate America’s latest death-dealing machinery. Hollywood movies are made with U.S. military cooperation and that military often has veto power over scripts. To cite only one example, the war movie 12 Strong (2018) turned the disastrous Afghan War that lasted two horrendous decades into a stunningly quick American victory, all too literally won by U.S. troops riding horses. (If only the famed cowboy actor John Wayne had still been alive to star in it!)\nThe MICIMATT(SH), employing millions of Americans, consuming trillions of dollars, and churning through tens of thousands of body bags for U.S. troops over the years, while killing millions of people abroad, is an almost irresistible force. And right now, it seems like there’s no unmovable object to blunt it.\nBelieve me, I’ve tried. I’ve written dozens of “Tomgrams” suggesting steps America could take to reverse militarism and warmongering. As I look over those essays, I see what still seem to me sensible ideas, but they die quick deaths in the face of, if not withering fire from the MICIMATT(SH), then being completely ignored by those who matter.\nAnd while this country has a department of war (disguised as a department of defense), it has no department of peace. There’s no budget anywhere for making peace, either. We do have a colossal Pentagon that houses 30,000 workers, feverishly making war plans they won’t let Elon Musk (or any of us) see.  It’s for their eyes only, not yours, though they may well ask you or your kids to serve in the military, because the best-laid plans of those war-men do need lots of warm bodies, even if those very plans almost invariably (Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc.) go astray.\nSo, to repeat myself, how do you take on the MICIMATT(SH)? The short answer: It’s not easy, but I know of a few people who had some inspirational ideas.\nOn Listening to Ike, JFK, MLK, and, Yes, Madison, Too\nMilitarism isn’t exactly a new problem in America. Consider Randolph Bourne’s 1918 critique of war as “the health of the state,” or General Smedley Butler’s confession in the 1930s that “war is a racket” run by the “gangsters of capitalism.” In fact, many Americans have, over the years, spoken out eloquently against war and militarism. Many beautiful and moving songs have asked us to smile on your brother and “love one another right now.” War, as Edwin Starr sang so powerfully once upon a time, is good for “absolutely nothin’,” though obviously a lot of people disagree and indeed are making a living by killing and preparing for yet more of it.\nAnd that is indeed the problem. Too many people are making too much money off of war. As Smedley Butler wrote so long ago: “Capital won’t permit the taking of the profit out of war until the people – those who do the suffering and still pay the price – make up their minds that those they elect to office shall do their bidding, and not that of the profiteers.” Pretty simple, right? Until you realize that those whom we elect are largely obedient to the moneyed class because the highest court in our land has declared that money is speech. Again, I didn’t say it was going to be easy. Nor did Butler.\nAs a retired lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force, I want to end my 111th piece at TomDispatch by focusing on the words of Ike, John F. Kennedy (JFK), Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK), and James Madison. And I want to redefine what words like duty, honor, country, and patriotism should mean. Those powerful words and sentiments should be centered on peace, on the preservation and enrichment of life, on tapping “the better angels of our nature,” as Abraham Lincoln wrote so long ago in his First Inaugural Address.\nWhy do we serve? What does our oath of office really mean? For it’s not just military members who take that oath but also members of Congress and indeed the president himself. We raise our right hands and swear to support and defend the U.S. Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, to bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\nThere’s nothing in that oath about warriors and warfighters, but there is a compelling call for all of us, as citizens, to be supporters and defenders of representative democracy, while promoting the general welfare (not warfare), and all the noble sentiments contained in that Constitution. If we’re not seeking a better and more peaceful future, one in which freedom may expand and thrive, we’re betraying our oath.\nIf so, we have met the enemy – and he is us.\nIke told us in 1953 that constant warfare is no way of life at all, that it is (as he put it), humanity crucifying itself on a cross of iron. In 1961, he told us democracy was threatened by an emerging military-industrial complex and that we, as citizens, had to be both alert and knowledgeable enough to bring it to heel. Two years later, JFK told us that peace – even at the height of the Cold War – was possible, not just peace in our time, but peace for all time. However, it would, he assured us, require sacrifice, wisdom, and commitment.\nHow, in fact, can I improve on these words that JFK uttered in 1963, just a few months before he was assassinated?\n“What kind of peace do we seek? Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living…\nI speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war makes no sense in an age… when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn… surely the acquisition of such idle [nuclear] stockpiles – which can only destroy and never create – is not the only, much less the most efficient, means of assuring peace.\nI speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men. I realize that the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war – and frequently the words of the pursuer fall on deaf ears. But we have no more urgent task.\nAre we ready to be urgently rational, America? Are we ready to be blessed as peacemakers? Or are we going to continue to suffer from what MLK described in 1967 as our very own “spiritual death” due to the embrace of militarism, war, empire, and racism?\nOf course, MLK wasn’t perfect, nor for that matter was JFK, who was far too enamored of the Green Berets and too wedded to a new strategy of “flexible response” to make a clean break in Vietnam before he was killed. Yet those men bravely and outspokenly promoted peace, something uncommonly rare in their time – and even more so in ours.\nMore than 200 years ago, James Madison warned us that continual warfare is the single most corrosive force to the integrity of representative democracy. No other practice, no other societal force is more favorable to the rise of authoritarianism and the rule of tyrants than pernicious war. Wage war long and it’s likely you can kiss your democracy, your rights, and just maybe your ass goodbye.\nAmerica, from visionaries and prophets like MLK, we have our marching orders. They are not to invest yet more in preparations for war, whether with China or any other country. Rather, they are to gather in the streets and otherwise raise our voices against the scourge of war. If we are ever to beat our swords into plowshares and our spears into pruning hooks and make war no more, something must be done.\nLet’s put an end to militarism in America. Let’s be urgently rational. To cite John Lennon yet again: You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one. Together, let’s imagine and create a better world.\nWilliam J.

Based on extensive archival research, this essay brings to light its secret history so that it may be widely known.\nLenat’s journey began with his PhD work on automated mathematical discovery through heuristic search. He observed that such systems initially make promising discoveries but quickly “run out of steam” as they exhaust their initial pool of heuristic rules. His follow-up system EURISKO, famous for winning tournament competitions by finding unconventional tactics, faced similar limitations. These experiences convinced Lenat that true AI needed a vast foundation of common sense knowledge to avoid intellectual exhaustion.\nIn 1984, he launched Cyc to manually encode millions of facts and rules about common sense, predicting that once this “knowledge pump” was primed, the system would begin true machine learning by reading natural language texts and conducting autonomous scientific experiments. Cyc grew to contain approximately 30 million assertions at a cost of $200 million and 2,000 person-years. Yet despite Lenat’s repeated predictions of imminent breakthrough, it never came.\nIn terms of funding, Cycorp was probably half-funded by the military and intelligence before 2010, and entirely funded by commercial applications since 2016. Cycorp achieved long-term financial stability that is uncommon for a small technology company, but all known commercial uses of its system involve standard methods in expert systems, data integration, and information retrieval, functionally the same as similar services offered by established corporations like Oracle and IBM. No evidence suggests that Cyc’s purported higher intelligence provided any competitive advantage.\nBy academic standards, the Cyc project is highly insular. Publications involving Cyc typically described methods for entering information into the system, rarely addressing applications out of it. Outside Cycorp, Cyc saw minimal use in AI research or even in knowledge retrieval, its most adjacent field. Academics found the system difficult to use, and it never performed on public benchmarks. Spin-off projects like OpenCyc and various semantic web initiatives all eventually shut down without notable success.\nThe secretive nature of Cyc has multiple causes. Lenat personally did not release the source code of his PhD project or EURISKO, remained unimpressed with open source, and disliked academia as much as academia disliked him. Most open information concerning Cyc had been deliberately removed circa 2015, at the moment when Cycorp pivoted to commercial applications.\nLenat had a single philosophical vision for AI that he pursued for 40 years. Guided by it, he had consistently rejected every alternative vision for AI, including the heuristic search approach, the expert systems approach, the robotics approach, and the neural network approach. All were rejected as either “shallow pattern-matching” seeking a “free lunch” on one end, or a “mystical worship of physical embodiment” on the other end.\nAs of 2025, 9 years after the knowledge pump had been primed, there is still no sign that Cyc would ever achieve general intelligence.\nMore archival material available on GitHub.\nMany years later, surrounded by the humming servers of the knowledge base, Douglas Lenat was to remember that distant afternoon when he taught Cyc that everyone can only see their own dream.\nIn the land of AI, there had been legends, of people and systems that were before their time, that showed sparks of brilliance but without followups, and Douglas Lenat was a man of three.\nLenat’s first legend was his Automated Mathematician (AM), a system that, according to the legends, discovered mathematical concepts autonomously by distilling concepts out of patterns and remixing and stirring together previous concepts (D. B. Lenat 1976). As we will see, this legend is mostly true, though with a caveat that leads to the topic of his second legend.\nAM was his 1976 PhD thesis project, and it was one of many “automated discovery” systems in the 1970s – the only one still remembered nowadays. Though neural networks and other “self-organized” machine learning methods had mostly died out in the 1960s, machine learning did not die, and indeed, was going through a logical spring, under the banner of “automated discovery”.\nNowadays, when we think of “machine learning”, we think of random forests, neural networks, and such. But back then, machine learning was understood as “logical AI gone meta”. Well, to go meta, we must first understand: What is logical AI? Simon and Newell, the two giants of logical AI, had shown the way: logical AI is heuristic search.\nWell, chess is a game, and so is Euclidean geometry, symbolic integration, and… perhaps scientific discovery itself? The famed scientific method, to deserve the name “method”, ought to be just one more problem for logical AI to solve. It merely remained to go meta, to heuristically search over the space of heuristic searches.\nDuring 1977–1983, Pat Langley wrote a series of programs named BACON, after Francis Bacon, a father of scientific empiricism. It purported to discover scientific laws from mere data. For example, when given a table of the moles \\(N\\), pressures \\(P\\), volumes \\(V\\), and temperatures \\(T\\) of gas samples, BACON would first try out simple equations involving two of the terms. It would discover that the data for \\(PV\\) appears more cluster-like than either \\(P\\) or \\(V\\), so it would make a new quantity \\(PV\\), and add that to the table. It would then repeat this process, discovering that \\(PV/T\\) is an interesting quantity, and finally that \\(PV/NT\\) is a constant quantity – the ideal gas law discovered! (Langley 1981)\nIn the logical AI framework, the problem space of BACON is the space of all elementary functions involving the table columns, and a solution is a (nontrivial) function that results in a nearly constant column. At each step, the program tries out simple combinations of the current columns, and heuristically pick the one most nearly constant.\nAs another example, consider the famed Dendral and Meta-Dendral.\nDendral was an artificial model of how professional chemists perform molecular spectroscopy – that is, how they read out a molecular structure from looking at a few spiky curves. Its problem space is the space of all possible ways to cut up a molecule into fragments, and ways for the fragments to give and take their atoms. Its heuristics are the rules for generating chemically plausible and implausible cleavages and transfers. For example, it is plausible for a protein to be cleaved at the -CO-*-NH- peptide bond, but implausible to be cleaved at the double bond between C and O. The goal is, given molecular spectroscopic data for a single molecule, to construct a molecular structure and a sequence of cleavages and transfers, such that it would produce the data.\nWith Meta-Dendral, the problem space goes meta, becoming the space of possible chemical rules. Its goal is to find plausible rules (plausible according to heuristic meta-rules) that can explain a large collection of molecular structures and their spectroscopic data. Meta-Dendral proved useful for working chemists by discovering some cleavage rules for a certain minor sub-family of androstanes. (Buchanan and Feigenbaum 1981) \nIn general, such a system begins with some simple rules that allow the system to a low score according to some criteria. and as it runs, it builds, prunes, and modifies the rules, so that in the end, its rule set allows it to achieve a high score. The following tabulates a few (Walker 1987):\nThe honor of your machine is preserved.\n— Paul Erdős, after examining (D. B. Lenat 1976, appendix 4).\nWithin this context, AM is different. It is still a logical AI with a problem space and a heuristic search. However, there is no data: It was mostly “self-play”.\nTo start AM, Lenat began by entering 115 concepts in set theory and ~250 heuristic rules, and thence AM ran, discovering more and more constructions. Most would be trivial, but a few would be interesting, and these interesting constructions would be stored, allowing further constructions upon them. It secured a place as a minor legend, reportedly rediscovering many concepts, such as the natural numbers, the prime numbers, and the Goldbach conjecture.\nA concept is essentially a frame, which are essentially objects in object-oriented programming. A concept has 25 possible facets, which are “slots”, or “data fields”. Not all need to be filled.\nThe following is an example concept with many facets populated (D. B. Lenat 1983c, table 9.9):\n\nAM has an agenda: a list of tasks, each with a list of reasons for the task. Each task is of the form “Perform operation O to facet F of concept C”. A task’s Worth is the sum of its reasons’ worths. AM always performs the task with the highest worth.\nTo perform a task, AM looks for heuristic rules whose conditions are (mostly) satisfied, and whose worth is (pretty) high. Each heuristic rule is of form “if <condition>, then run <actions>”. Each action has 3 kinds of possible effects:\nSome example heuristic rules:\nAt this point, the careful reader would notice several problems:\nHow does AM know that the concept should be called “Prime Numbers”? Ah, that’s because Lenat would regularly interrupt and inspect AM, and if Lenat notices that AM has rediscovered, say, prime numbers, he would rename that from something like concept-421 to prime-numbers.\nTo discover prime numbers, AM must have a way to check if a Lisp object is a prime number or not. That is, the definition must also be a program. So…? Ah, the famous homoiconicity of Lisp came to the rescue! A definition, as stored within a facet of a concept, is a data, but for Lisp, data is program, and program data. Consequently, AM can run a subroutine that enumerates possible programs as data, and for each, interpret it as program, until AM hits upon a program that works (or times out).\nHow does it check that two definitions actually define the same thing? In general, this is impossible by Rice’s theorem, so Lenat must have used some heuristic rules. I looked, but can’t find Lenat explaining this anywhere. It seemed like a trick of the hand.\nBut most serious of all issues is that the most critical part of AM was not the concepts it discovered – after all, mathematicians did not need a computer to inform them that prime numbers are interesting. The most critical part was surely the heuristic rules by which AM worked, and many were entirely hand-waved. The most detailed description was in (D. B. Lenat 1976, appendix 3), and it is still not described to a level of detail that may allow reimplementation.\nConsider rule 75: “A constructive existence conjecture is interesting if it is frequently used.” How frequent is “frequent”? What threshold of frequency triggers the increase in interestingness, and by how much? There are even vaguer rules, such as rule 69: “Formulate a parameterized conjecture, a ‘template’, which gets slowly specialized or instantiated into a definite conjecture.”.\nNow, these would have not been a problem if AM was just a forgotten system, but it was not. The achievements of AM was impressive enough that it was an instant celebrity among the AI people, winning an IJCAI Award just 1 year after publication (D. B. Lenat 1977). Anecdotes even suggested that the AI mathematician was here:1\n1 This anecdote corroborates (D. B. Lenat 1976, appendix 4.6).\nOn one memorable occasion, one of my advisors, George Polya, was looking at its results, and remarked “That reminds me of something a student of a friend of mine once did.” He rummaged through an old trunk, found the relevant correspondence, and it turned out that his friend was G. H. Hardy, and the student was Srinivasa Ramanujan! Even though that regularity (involving highly composite numbers) has no practical significance, Polya and I were happy to see AM behaving much like the young self-taught Indian genius had, in his explorations in search for interesting regularities.\n(D. B. Lenat 2022a)\nThe swirling controversy came to a head with the publication of (Ritchie and Hanna 1984), which argued that AM was badly documented. That, its control structure probably was not “simply pick the task with the highest worth”, but more complicated. This called into question the Lenat claim that the heuristic rules were the load-bearing parts of AM, which Lenat had implied by emphasizing its almost trivially simple control structure. Further, some crucial quantitative heuristic rules were probably hidden behind vague qualitative handwaves like “A nonconstructive existence conjecture is interesting” (rule 74). Now, handwaving would have not been a problem if they were intended as merely glosses over the source code, but the source code was also unpublished, making it impossible for other other researchers to reproduce or extend the work, or to reinterpret AM’s workings.\nIn short, because of the various issues, AM was an event that happened, but not an entity that could be built upon. One could not build upon it directly in source code, since it’s unavailable. One could not build upon it by reimplementing the pseudocode, since the rules were vaguely specified, and the control structure was probably wrong. One could not build upon it by reimplementing the high-level ideas, since it’s unclear which part, out of the several dozen tightly integrated parts of AM, was responsible for AM’s good outputs, and which were just implementation details. In our language, there was no ablation study.\nLenat quickly replied with (D. B. Lenat and Brown 1984). He dismissed the criticism as mostly miscommunication, and went on to describe the real lesson of AM. If I were to be dab, Lenat was saying that it is fine for AM’s source,2 or even pseudocode, to be unavailable, because Lenat had learned the lessons, and you, dear reader, need only listen to the lessons from him.\n2 Though Lenat admitted that “the code ought to have been provided” (D. B. Lenat and Brown 1984) for AM, he would never publish the code, not with AM, nor with EURISKO. He had often claimed it had been long lost, yet the source code for AM and EURISKO had recently been found, right where it should be – the DBL folder in the Stanford AI Laboratory backup data. It could only be found because Lenat had died, thus releasing the password protection on the folder. I wonder if Lenat had lied, and simply wished to protect his source code. It would correlate with his later behavior.\nThe AM thesis never explained, precisely, how concepts such as ‘not very often’ and ‘related to’ were implemented. By and large, these omissions were due to the fact that the code Lenat wrote for these predicates was quite trivial… inevitable, yet regrettable process of simplifying large pieces of code, translating them to brief English phrases. This process left out many exceptional cases, and made the English condensations less accurate… Some problems that Ritchie and Hanna cite… are simply errors of mis-reading what was stated in the thesis or articles… A few of the problems raised in Ritchie and Hanna’s article are, annoyingly, genuine inconsistencies in the thesis document, such as whether or not facets had subfacets. These reflect the fact that AM was a running and evolving program, changing daily in small ways even as the thesis document was being written… the changes in representation were driven simply by AM’s running out of list space in 1975 INTERLISP code; we were forced to shift representations time and time again just to gain a few hundred precious list cells.\n(D. B. Lenat and Brown 1984)\nAnd what were the lessons?\n1th lesson: AM exhausts itself. Roughly speaking, each new interesting discovery depends on ~24 heuristics, and each heuristic has a hand in ~24 discoveries. Therefore, with ~N heuristic rules, there would be ~N interesting discoveries. Because AM cannot discover heuristic rules, with ~300 starting heuristic rules, it would run out of interesting discoveries and “die of boredom”. Lenat could help AM by adding new heuristics, and AM would make some new discoveries, but this never lasted.\nEventually, AM acquired an uncommon ailment for a computing system: intellectual exhaustion. Having explored the esoteric reaches of mathematics, AM suddenly downshifted into a preoccupation with rudimentary arithmetic. Finally, with the remark, “Warning! No task on the agenda has priority over 200.”, the system virtually expired, as though from boredom.\n(Hiltzik 2001)\n2th lesson: Representation matters a lot. AM worked so well for mathematics, because AM used Lisp code as data. Lisp is the perfect tool if you want to search over the space of interesting mathematical functions. You can modify a Lisp expression, and get a different mathematical function that is possibly interesting. In contrast, if you were to modify assembly code, you’d most likely end up with nonsense. Indeed, Lenat found that he could not extend AM to “go meta” and discover new heuristics, because Lisp is good for math, not “heuretics” (the study of heuristics). Modifying a Lisp expression for a heuristic most likely ends up with nonsense, much like modifying assembly code for a mathematical function.\nIt was only because of the intimate relationship between LISP and Mathematics that the mutation operators (loop unwinding, recursion elimination, composition, argument elimination, function substitution, etc.) turned out to yield a high ‘hit rate’ of viable, useful new math concepts when applied to previously-known, useful math concepts – concepts represented as LISP functions. But no such deep relationship existed between LISP and Heuretics, and when the basic automatic programming (mutations) operators were applied to viable, useful heuristics, they almost always produced useless (often worse than useless) new heuristic rules.\n…\nWe did not perceive until writing this paper that the way in which Similar-To, Not-Often, Notice-Regularity, and scores of other ‘primitives’ were coded do themselves embody a large amount of heuristic knowledge. We exploited the structure of (or, if you prefer, partially encoded) the domain of elementary mathematics, in the process of making trivial yet adequate LISP versions of those extremely complex and subtle notions (such as similarity of concepts).\n(D. B. Lenat and Brown 1984)\nHow do we know that Lenat learned the lessons?\nThough 1981 is still near, EURISKO is already shrouded in a reverential mystery like legends do, among the Deep Blue, the Samuel Checkers Player, and the apprentice’s broom. A symbol, a moral archetype. A program that discovered loopholes in a sci-fi ship-building tournament, allowing its creator to win twice in a row using fleets so unaesthetic that the people running the tournament threatened to stop the tournaments if it would win thrice, so it retired, the Honorary Admiral, EURISKO the Undefeated.\nBrilliant, dramatic, but what do we glean from it, other than a moral play about the power of thinking sideways and seeing through? Quite a lot.\nAs we saw, AM raised many questions, and Lenat wrote EURISKO to answer them. Specifically, he wanted to see if EURISKO could avoid intellectual exhaustion if it could also discover heuristics. If AM exhausted itself because it has used up the worth of its heuristics (1th lesson), then why not let the computer discover more heuristics? Since AM could not efficiently search over heuristic rules using LISP (2th lesson), Lenat designed a new language called RLL (“Representation Language Language”), over which heuristic rules are efficient to search.\nAs in AM, each heuristic in EURISKO had a level of Worth. Higher-worth heuristics were more likely to be invoked. Each heuristic had a CreditTo, so that if a heuristic rule rose in worth, its CreditTo would also rise in worth. When EURISKO was born, and saw itself, all the heuristic rules it had were branded with CreditTo = DBLenat, but this would soon change, as heuristics begat heuristics.\nYet while Lenat solved the problems raised by the first two lessons of AM, EURISKO failed, from which Lenat learned two further lessons. As we will see, it turned out that EURISKO did exhaust itself eventually after all. Self-discovery of heuristic rules eventually ceased, because self-discovery of heuristic rules relied on meta-heuristic rules about heuristic rules, and those rules run out of steam after a dozen or so uses.\nLenat concluded that he could program 100 heuristics and get a system that could discover 1000 rules, or program 100 meta-heuristics and get a system that could discover 1000 heuristics and 10000 rules, but none of these would be truly autonomous, and Lenat wished for more. He wished for something that could be an equal to humanity, that would grow up and explore into the great beyond, where it could no longer rely on humans for help. Lenat concluded that there really is no way to get a working automated discovery program without doing the hard work of hand-coding in a lot of common sense, and that there would be a point at which this system would finally achieve escape velocity, and would never be exhausted again.\nWhy would common sense help? Lenat observed how humans don’t seem to get stuck like EURISKO. He concluded that humans don’t run out of steam because they have a vast store of common sense knowledge about the world, from which they can draw upon for analogies, those far-flung flights of fancies that, in sufficient quantities, allow them to generate genuinely new ideas endlessly. For example, one can draw a line of analogy between the military and the medical, so that a doctor can “fighting an infection by an encircling movement with antibiotics”. This is the 3th lesson.\nWhy would analogies give genuinely new ideas? Well, intelligence is messy! If everything is so uniform, then there is no way to make a far-flung analogy – everything is pretty much the same already. Besides, just look at all the broken dreams of logical AI – their corpses tell us that no elegant theory of intelligence exists. Programming a genuine AI is a messy job. Messiness is a hideous strength. This is the 4th lesson.\nThe apparent adhoc-ness in both the heuristics’ content themselves, and in the control knowledge guiding the application of those heuristics, is clearly the source of many methodological objections to the work. But we believe that this adhocracy – indeed, adhocracy controlling adhocracy – may be the source of EURISKO’s underlying potential especially as a model for cognition.\n(D. B. Lenat and Brown 1984)\nThose are the lessons Lenat drew, but what did EURISKO really do?\nOther than winning the sci-fi naval battle tournaments, EURISKO also worked on number theory, set theory, simulation of evolution, and metal-oxide (MOS) design. In MOS, it designed some new circuit elements that were verified by physical fabrication, such as a more efficient flip-flop that was “difficult to produce masks for and difficult to fabricate, but extremely small and fast”.\nLenat had a novel idea about how evolution works, one that I have not seen anywhere else. His idea was that purely random mutations are too slow for evolutionary progress, so that evolution must have gone “meta” as well. A substantial portion of the genome is probably not coding for direct protein transcription, but rather for a kind of heuristics, so that instead of trying out all possible mutations, evolution only tries out mutations that are likely useful. And of course, this would have gone meta, with meta-heuristic genes coding for useful ways to mutate the heuristic genes. (D. B. Lenat 1980)\nHere is a mechanism which embodies the heuristic “If a gene has mutated successfully several times in the recent past, then increase its chance of mutating in the next generation, and conversely.” All we need to posit is that somehow a short, noncoding sequence—we’ll call it an asterisk—is added to a gene each time it mutates [and] some mechanism (for example, stereochemical) whereby genes with many asterisks are more likely to be mutated, duplicated, and so on, than genes with few or none. Since the asterisks provide no specific benefits to the individual, they will gradually be lost over time, so that when a gene no longer should be mutated, its asterisk count will slowly decline over several generations.\n…\n… recombination among introns modulates the evolution of a gene. Let’s look at an example of this: it is extremely important to keep the a, b, and d globin genes separate, but their internal structure is very similar. To inhibit recombination, the spacers between them can be made very different, and the introns within them can diverge dramatically (since mutations in introns are not as deleterious to the functioning of the gene as mutations to the coding regions). In fact, there is evidence that both of these kinds of divergence do occur for the globins.\n(D. B. Lenat 1983c)\nAt the start, only random mutations would be selected for, but eventually heuristics would arise that create likely advantageous mutations, and then evolution would go meta by one level: it would select for good heuristics. Over the natural history of earth, this can go meta for as many levels as time allows.\nThe paper goes into further speculative details, and makes a half-humorous–half-horror suggestion that perhaps evolution has worked for so long that the genome now contains a sophisticated intelligent designer, bootstrapped from the billions of years of heuristics-upon-heuristics backstopped by natural selection. The tiny designer would design the progeny’s genome, so that almost nothing in the mutation is “random”.\nSince it has an expectation of how things “should go”, it might regard the human experiment as a failure because humans are driving the natural world so far out of its expectation. For example, the designer might have learned a rule “If the environment temperature is varying outside of 20 ± 10 °C , then undo the previous mutation. We have clearly created an offspring that is wandering too much.”, then it would find the human experiment a big mistake and start mashing the undo button.\nBy now a large knowledge base may exist about ecology, geology, glaciation, seasons, gravity, predation, symbiosis, causality, conservation, behavior, evolution and knowledge itself. In a small number of generations, man has managed to invalidate many of these bits of knowledge, this model of the world. If the heuristics can trace this breakdown to the increasing size of our brains, they might take quick corrective action, preserving homeostasis and the validity of their knowledge base by drastically decreasing human brain size over just a few generations. While this is of course a fanciful tongue-in-cheek extreme case, it (and the longer example above) demonstrates the power, the coordination, that a body of heuristics could evince if it were guiding the process of evolution.\n(D. B. Lenat 1983c)\nImagine a species getting so good at adaptation that it is considered a mistake and thus undone. Wouldn’t that be the greatest joke of nature?\nBut we’re really here to hear about the cool naval battles, not more abstract logics. Unfurl the photonic sails. We go.\nLenat did not describe why, one July 4 weekend of 1981, he and EURISKO decided to enter the The Trillion Credit Squadron tournament. Perhaps for glory, or the thrill of the hunt. In any case, they did, and thus carved their legend.\nThe tournament was for the tabletop RPG game Traveller. Despite purportedly about space battles in a galactic empire, the game was essentially just a simplified version of WWII-era navy battles draped in space-opera garments. In the tournament, pairs of starship generals line up their fleets and fight until one side loses all their ships or surrenders. Each fleet must be built within a budget of 1 trillion credits (thus the name), 100 ships, and under certain other minor constraints.\nAt the start, Lenat went through the rule books and coded the rules into EURISKO. Then, every evening EURISKO would run through its tasks, including Traveller games, MOS design, math problems, and so on. And every morning, Lenat would check on the last night’s results, remove some heuristics that EURISKO discovered that he deemed bad, and add some others. Manual intervention was necessary since otherwise EURISKO can be stuck with bad heuristics for a long time, and because of weird meta-bugs. Lenat estimated that the final EURISKO had accumulated 1300 CPU-hours of runtime in total on a Xerox 1100 Lisp machine, and the Traveller win was “60/40% Lenat/EURISKO”.\nSome heuristics that Lenat hardcoded at the start were:\nThese were used by EURISKO for fleet design:\nOne type of craft which is commonly included is a fighter, which is carried into the area by a carrier… Following R7, the possibility was considered of building fighters that could transport themselves into the battle area; due to the way the constraints were set up, this turned out to be a very powerful–if bizarre–design tactic. Essentially, each fighter was equipped with just enough ‘sailing’ and ‘launching’ equipment for it not to need a carrier. Once airborne, this excess equipment was jettisoned… This design tactic caused the rules publishers to modify the constraints, so that in 1982 one could not legally build such a thing.\n…\nThe constraints specified a minimum fractional tonnage which had to be held back, away from battle [under the pretense of “fuel tenders”]. R7 caused us to consider using warships for that purpose, and indeed that proved a useful decision: whenever some front-line ships were moderately (but not totally) damaged, they traded places with the tenders in the rear lines. This maneuver was explicitly permitted in the rules, but no one had ever employed it except in desperation near the end of a nearly-stalemated battle, when little besides tenders were left intact. Due to the unintuitive and undesirable power of this design, the tournament directors altered the rules so that in 1982 and succeeding years the act of “trading places” is not so instantaneous. The rules modifications introduced more new synergies (loopholes) than they eliminated, and one of those involved having a ship which, when damaged, fired on (and sunk) itself so as not to reduce the overall fleet agility.\n…\nIn the naval fleet design task, R9 was used quite heavily. The functions \\(f\\) in that simulated world apply to the design and behavior of fleets and of individual ships: FleetComposition, Agility, Armor, WeaponVariety, TimeToEngage, etc… the ultimate design did settle on a fleet containing almost all identical ships, each with nearly minimal agility, maximal armor, maximal weapon variety, almost all of which engaged with the enemy immediately, etc. One extremal ship employed in the 1981 tournament was a tiny but incredibly agile ship, with no offense whatsoever, that simply could not be hit. Although this was no longer legal in 1982, a ship with massive offensive capability and no defense was instrumental in that new fleet.\n…\n[For R16,] once a new design was tested in simulated combat, several characteristics of the conflict were noted (speed of victory, final state of the victor, amount of tactical decision-making required, etc.). These were formed into proto-conjectures, which were then tested by subsequent mock battles, and any which held over most of the simulations were believed as empirically valid.\n(D. B. Lenat 1983b)\nOther than hard-coded heuristics, EURISKO of course discovered many heuristics on its own, such as the “nearly extreme” rule: In almost all fleet design situations, the right decision is to go for the nearly extremal design.\nThus, the final ships had Agility 2 (slightly above the absolute minimum), one weapon of each type of small weapons (rather than 0 or many), the fleet had almost as many ships as it could legally have but not quite (96 instead of 100), etc. Big weapons (enormous spinal mounts capable of blasting another ship to pieces with a single shot) were gradually phased out, in favor of an enormous number of small missile weapons. The fleet had almost all (75) ships of this type though there was one ship which was small and super agile and purely defensive (and literally unhittable by any reasonable enemy ship), and a couple monstrous hulks which had no chance of defense against normal ships, but which had weapons just barely accurate enough to hit any enemy ships that were (of course!) small and agile and purely defensive.\n(D. B. Lenat 1983b)\nOne might have questioned the wisdom of running EURISKO every night on all the problem domains, from Traveller to MOS design, but it found good use of heuristic rules learned in one domain applied to another, what we’d now call “transfer learning”:\nIn working on the design of integrated circuits, for example, EURISKO stumbled on the fact that symmetry is a desirable property for such chips, although it did not understand why; when it was later instructed to design fleets for the Traveller game, EURISKO decided to make them symmetrical and justified its decision by referring to its earlier experience in designing circuits.\n(D. B. Lenat 1984)\nFortunately for EURISKO and Lenat, the navy battles were “tactically trivial”, thus reducing the task to merely nonlinear optimization. Also importantly, the problem was hard enough, and nonlinear enough, for EURISKO to show its edge over linear programming and human intuition.\nwith 50 parameters per ship, about 10 values for each parameter (sometimes fewer, often an infinite number), and up to 100 distinct ships to design and include in each fleet, any systematic or Monte Carlo analysis of the problem is unlikely to succeed. In fact, the designers had done a detailed linear programming model of the game, and their computer runs convinced them that a fleet of about 20 behemoths was the optimal design. This was close to the starting fleet design the author supplied to EURISKO, and it was also close to the designs that most of the tournament entrants came up with.\n(D. B. Lenat 1983a)\nAt the 1981 championship, EURISKO’s fleet consisted of 96 ships:\nThe fleet was actually precisely reported in The Journal of the Travellers’ Aid Society, #10, pp. 38-9, which Yuxi had transcribed to plaintext (thenceforth “report”). Not being an honorary Admiral, agi convened with a council of 4 other LLMs (Gemini-2.5, Claude-3.7, OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1) to figure out how to correlate Lenat’s verbal description in (D. B. Lenat 1983a) (thenceforth “description”) with the precise report.\nIn fact, it’s quite confusing even in the original paper. All agreed that the 75 “Eurisko class” ships corresponded to the “Eurisko class” in the report. But that’s where clarity ended.\nThe “stalemate guarantor” was described as “one ship which was small and super agile and purely defensive (and literally unhittable by any reasonable enemy ship)”. However, in the report, every single class contained more than one ship. There were two classes that seemed like the stalemate guarantor: the Wasp class with 1000 tons and Agility 6, and the Bee class with 99 tons and Agility 0. The Bee class had the smallest tonnage but no Agility, while the Wasp class was second-smallest and had the highest Agility. The Council voted Wasp as the “stalemate guarantor” at 3 Yea (Yuxi, Claude, o1), 1 Nay (Gemini), and R1 abstaining due to the server being busy (abstaining is typical behavior for the Chinese during Big-Five votes). Those who voted “Yea” were unable to respond to Gemini’s objection as to what EURISKO used the Bee class for, and motioned to discuss the second issue.\nThe hard counter to the stalemate guarantor was described even less clearly, and it seemed like there were two classes of them!\na couple monstrous hulks which had no chance of defense against normal ships, but which had weapons just barely accurate enough to hit any enemy ships that were (of course!) small and agile and purely defensive. … this new ship had moderate size, no armor, the largest possible guidance computer, the slowest possible engines for its size and equipment, and one single, enormous accelerator weapon–a weapon usually ignored because its broad beam glances harmlessly off large armor-plated ships, but which is very easy to aim.\n(D. B. Lenat 1983a)\nThe first hard counter matched both the Cisor class and the Queller class, both of which had over 19,000 tons and Agility 0. The second hard counter seemed like the Garter class, with 12,000 tons and Agility 4.\nYuxi lamented that it would have saved the Council a great deal of trouble if the report had detailed what weapons the ships used, but alas, they only reported on the “batteries”. It was at this point that o1 and Gemini raised that the “Batteries Bearing” did not actually stand for “carrying around electric batteries”, but rather “the angle which the artillery could span its fire”. Yuxi expressed astonishment that they could recall the rules of Classic Traveller. “What a nerd!”, muttered Yuxi. There was no reaction from the others, since the meeting was entirely text-based. Yuxi then sent the entire (Traveller Book 5: High Guard 1980) to Gemini for a translation, in response to which Gemini suggested that Yuxi RTFM, “Specifically, pages 21–37 and 50–52 are crucial.”.\nThe Council’s final conclusion was that probably there were two types of hard counters, with the Cisor being the “monstrous hulk” and the Queller being the one with the “enormous accelerator”.\nReading Gemini’s statement, Claude raised the issue of what the Garter class was supposed to be. At that point, Yuxi re-attended to the fact that (D. B. Lenat 1983b) described a slightly different fleet, one with “fuel tenders”, which (D. B. Lenat 1983a) did not describe at all. Upon presenting the quote describing “fuel tenders”, Gemini argued that the Garter class is the fuel tender, and the Council concurred.\nThe Council reached no concensus as to the purpose of the Bee, though some suspected that the Bee was another type of stalemate guarantor, possibly the original accidentally-discovered stalemate guarantor, as described in:\nSome of the strangest elements of the final fleet were discovered accidentally rather than as the result of a long, continuous evolution process. The usefulness of a tiny defensive ship was apprehended after a ‘lifeboat’ was the only survivor from one side’s fleet, yet round after round it could not be hit at all. That design was immortalized into a design strategy (“Include one such ship in your fleet!”), and a very general rule began looking for ships that could destroy it.\n(D. B. Lenat 1983a)\nYuxi raised one final issue, that of what the fighter “equipped with just enough ‘sailing’ and ‘launching’ equipment for it not to need a carrier” described in (D. B. Lenat 1983b) corresponded to. Gemini concluded that no such thing existed in the fleet as reported, since the 3 Bees and 7 Wasps were the only fighters in the fleet, and they were carried by exactly enough carriers (3 Quellers carrying 1 Wasp and 1 Bee each, 4 Garters carrying 1 Wasp each). Yet the description “This design tactic caused the rules publishers to modify the constraints, so that in 1982 one could not legally build such a thing.” strongly suggested that EURISKO actually used such a ship at one point in the 1981 competition.\nSomeone suggested that EURISKO may have used more than one fleet design, and only the design used in the final battle was reported. Yuxi acknowledged absent endorsement and motioned that the meeting adjourn.\nThe final report from the Council is attached.\nWhereas most battles took 2–4 hours, EURISKO’s opponents resigned in a few minutes, because typical opponents had around 20 large ships against EURISKO’s 96 ships. Each round would destroy EURISKO’s 15 ships and 5 of opponent’s ships. One round was enough for the opponent to realize this, and resign.\nThat is, except the very last round, where EURISKO faced against a human opponent with basically the same design, except they didn’t have the stalemate guarantor. So if EURISKO seemed to be losing, it could retreat all its fleet and bring out the stalemate guarantor, repair the fleet to full health, then do it again. EURISKO could keep doing this until a lucky dice roll to win.\nIts second opponent did some calculations and resigned without ever firing a shot. The subsequent opponents resigned during their first or second round of combat with this fleet. EURISKO’s few specialty ships remained unused until the final round of the tournament, battling for 1st versus 2nd place. That opponent also had ships with heavy armor, few large weapons, low agility, etc. He was lacking any fast ships or fast-ship-killers, though. The author simply pointed out to him that if EURISKO were losing then (according to the TCS rules) our side need put only our fast ship out the front line, withdraw all the others and repair them, and – once they were finished repairing themselves – effectively start the battle all over again. This could go on ad infinitum, until such time as EURISKO appeared to be winning, and in that case we would let the battle continue to termination. The opponent did a few calculations and surrendered without fighting.\nThe tournament directors were chagrined that a bizarre fleet such as this one captured the day, and a similar fleet (though not so extreme) took second place. The rules for future years’ TCS tournaments were changed to eliminate the design singularities which EURISKO found. For example, repairing of damaged ships was prohibited, so the utility of the unhittable ship became negligible.\n(D. B. Lenat 1983a)\nNotice that this complicates the typical narrative about a computer beating out humans. As it turns out, Traveller was just a very exploitable game. Even a human discovered that loophole.\nAt the 1982 championship, rules were changed to plug the loopholes, and the rules were published only a week before the event. Fortunately, loophole-plugging begat even more loopholes, as any programmer who has ever rush-debugged could attest, and EURISKO’s general heuristics (such as the “nearly extreme” rule) remained valid, so it worked out another winning fleet quickly without needing another 1300 CPU-hours.\nCoincidentally, just as the defensive ship made a difference in the 1981 final round, the offensive ships made a difference in the 1982 final round. In each case, their presence caused the opponent to resign without firing a shot… Just as most ‘experienced’ players jeered at the 1981 fleet because it had practically no large weapons, they jeered at the 1982 fleet because it was unarmored and it still had no large weapons, even though the rules changes had made them much cheaper.\n(D. B. Lenat 1983a)\nUnfortunately, there is no information whatsoever on the composition of EURISKO’s 1982 fleet. It seems to be lost in the star-dust of history.\nAs one expect from a program reasoning about and making its own rules, it stumbled into meta-bugs. The simplest example was one that kept triggering itself, creating an infinite loop. (Johnson 1986, chap. 10) Others were more amusing.\nOne of the first heuristics that EURISKO synthesized (H59) quickly attained nearly the highest Worth possible (999). Quite excitedly, we examined it and could not understand at first what it was doing that was so terrific. We monitored it carefully, and finally realized how it worked: whenever a new conjecture was made with high worth, this rule put its own name down as one of the discoverers! It turned out to be particularly difficult to prevent this generic type of finessing of EURISKO’s evaluation mechanism. Since the rules had full access to EURISKO’s code, they would have access to any safeguards we might try to implement. We finally opted for having a small ‘meta-level’ of protected code that the rest of the system could not modify.\nThe second ‘bug’ is even stranger. A heuristic arose which (as part of a daring but ill-advised experiment EURISKO was conducting) said that all machine-synthesized heuristics were terrible and should be eliminated. Luckily, EURISKO chose this very heuristic as one of the first to eliminate, and the problem solved itself.\n(D. B. Lenat 1983a)\nOften I’d find it in a mode best described as “dead”. Sometime during the night, EURISKO would decide that the best thing to do was to commit suicide and shut itself off. More precisely, it modified its own judgmental rules in a way that valued “making no errors at all” as highly as “making productive new discoveries”. As soon as EURISKO did this, it found it could successfully meet its new goal by doing nothing at all for the rest of the night… I eventually had to add a new heuristic to EURISKO-one it couldn’t modify in any way-to explicitly forbid this sort of suicide.\n(Stork 1998, 194)\n\nIn his review article, Lenat made a brief philosophical comment that EURISKO is the new perceptron:\n… the paradigm underlying AM and EURISKO may be thought of as the new generation of perceptrons, perceptrons based on collections or societies of evolving, self-organizing, symbolic knowledge structures. In classical perceptrons, all knowledge had to be encoded as topological networks of linked neurons, with weights on the links. The representation scheme being used by EURISKO provides much more powerful linkages, taking the form of heuristics about concepts, including heuristics for how to use and evolve heuristics. Both types of perceptrons rely on the law of large numbers, on a kind of local-global property of achieving adequate performance through the interactions of many small, relatively simple parts.\nThe classical perceptrons did hill-climbing, in spaces whose topology was defined explicitly by weights on arcs between nodes (nodes which did straightforward Boolean combinations plus thresholding). The EURISKO style of system does hill-climbing at both the object- (performance-program) and meta- (control decision) levels, in spaces whose terrain is defined implicitly, symbolically, by the contents of the nodes (nodes which are full-fledged concepts, at both object- and meta-levels). The new scheme fully exploits the same source of power (synergy through abundance) yet it is free from many of the limitations of the classical perceptron scheme.\n(D. B. Lenat and Brown 1984)\nIf this sounds familiar, it is because this Lenat had the same idea as Marvin Minsky, a friend of his,3 and he was writing in 1984, at the second coming of neural networks. Minsky would soon write his Society of Mind in 1986, which the Cyc project resembled, then re-reject neural networks by writing a long epilogue in 1988 to his infamous Perceptrons (1969), often blamed for the first neural network winter. Indeed, Lenat’s objection to neural networks was essentially the same as Minsky’s, if you compare that with Minsky’s epilogue. Lenat’s approach to Cyc was the same as the Society of Mind of Minsky. Reciprocating, Minsky had often called the field of AI “brain-dead”, holding Lenat’s Cyc as the only one worth mentioning. (Baard 2003)\n3 I’m not sure where to put this anecdote about Minsky that Lenat told, but I want to put it somewhere:\n… when he was at Lincoln Labs about 50 years ago. And in those days computer time was so precious that you submitted a deck of computer cards and the very first card said ‘how many CPU seconds to allow the program to run?’ And so he built a program that essentially would beg for time. So it would say ‘give 30 seconds’ on the job control card, but then once it started, all it would do is sit there for 15 seconds doing nothing. Then it would ring a bell on the Teletype console in the machine room and call the operator’s attention and say ‘I need 20 more seconds please.’ Then it would just sit there for another 15 seconds and do that again and say ‘I need another minute please.’ And so at the end finally after like half an hour, the operator just killed that particular job. And Marvin would storm into the poor operator’s room and say “Hey I put 15 seconds on the job control card. You’re charging me for half an hour of CPU time,” and the poor operator would say “well your program kept asking for it,” and Marvin would say, “it always does that.”\n(D. B. Lenat 2019b)\nThough now that I’ve finished the essay, this feels like a metaphor for the Cyc project itself.\n4 Though Lenat admitted that “the code ought to have been provided” (D. B. Lenat and Brown 1984) for AM, he would never publish the code, not with AM, nor with EURISKO. He had often claimed it had been long lost, yet the source code for AM and EURISKO had recently been found, right where it should be – the DBL folder in the Stanford AI Laboratory backup data. It could only be found because Lenat had died, thus releasing the password protection on the folder. I wonder if Lenat had lied, and simply wished to protect his source code. It would correlate with his later behavior.\nContinuing the trend of AM, Lenat never published the source code for EURISKO,4 and indeed, the only known attempt at reimplementation was (Haase 1990), which had no offspring.\nHe divided the universe into forty categories or classes, which were then subdivided into differences, and subdivided in turn into species. To each class he assigned a monosyllable of two letters; to each difference, a consonant; to each species, a vowel. For example, de means element; deb, the first of the elements, fire; deba, a portion of the element of fire, a flame. In a similar language invented by Letellier (1850),5 a means animal; ab, mammalian; abo, carnivorous; aboj, feline; aboje, cat; abi, herbivorous; abiv, equine; etc… children could learn this language without knowing that it was artificial; later, in school, they would discover that it was also a universal key and a secret encyclopedia.\nHaving defined Wilkins’ procedure, we must examine a problem that is impossible or difficult to postpone: the merit of the forty-part table on which the language is based. Let us consider the eighth category: stones. Wilkins divides them into common (flint, gravel, slate); moderate (marble, amber, coral); precious (pearl, opal); transparent (amethyst, sapphire); and insoluble (coal, fuller’s earth, and arsenic). The ninth category is almost as alarming as the eighth. It reveals that metals can be imperfect (vermilion, quicksilver); artificial (bronze, brass); recremental (filings, rust); and natural (gold, tin, copper). The whale appears in the sixteenth category: it is a viviparous, oblong fish.\n— Borges, The analytical language of John Wilkins\n5 Took some work to figure out what this is. It was by Charles Louis Augustin Letellier, published in 1852. The full title is Cours complet de langue universelle : offrant en même temps une méthode. pour apprendre les langues, et pour comparer. toutes les littératures mortes et vivantes [Complete course in universal language: offering at the same time a method for learning languages, and for comparing all literatures, dead and living].\nUnfortunately, EURISKO ran out of steam just like AM. Taking the 4 lessons of AM and EURISKO, Lenat concluded that there would be no free lunch. Intelligence is a lot of work. You need to put in the right representational language for reasoning and discovery – not just about Lisp or RLL or mathematics, but a lot more. You need to put in a lot of loosely organized, kind of correct heuristic rules – not just a few eternal truths of discovery. You need to put in a lot of facts. You need to interact with the program, to help it along and to be helped along, not just to sit and watch.\nSo Lenat began paying for his lunch.\nIn 1984, he started the Cyc project, an ambitious attempt to scale symbolic AI up to the real world. Like most expert systems, the Cyc project consists of a giant knowledge base that encodes all of common sense, upon which inference engines run. Unlike most expert systems, the ambition of Cyc was universal: Its knowledge base would not be restricted to expert knowledge in a particular domain, but all common sense knowledge in all domains that humans have ever common-sensed. It would take a decade, but considering the payoff, it would be completely worth it.\nAI has for many years understood enough about representation and inference to tackle this project, but no one has sat down and done it… only by pulling together the latest human interface tools, Lisp machines, ideas of enforced semantics, and funding for a decade-long effort could we attempt a project of this scale.\n(D. B. Lenat, Prakash, and Shepherd 1985)\nThe game plan was simple:\nThis would solve in one go three problems that plagued the 1980s expert systems:\nA metaphor that Lenat had used often is that of priming a water pump. The more knowledge Cyc has, the easier it is for Cyc to learn more. At first, it must be spoon-fed knowledge with every entry entered by hand. As it builds a basic understanding of the world, it would be able to parse sentences half-way from natural language to logic, and the ontologists would help finish the job, and the more it knew, the better it could parse, saving more time, until it would start parsing without human help. On that day, the “knowledge pump” would finally, triumphantly, be primed, and Cyc would start pumping and pumping, and more knowledge would just keep pouring out without any exhaustion, ushering a new golden age.\nThe first published plan of Cyc was in 1985 (D. B. Lenat, Prakash, and Shepherd 1985), with 3 stages:\nThey noted that most articles had just 1 paragraph, and 1 paragraph took about 1 person-day to encode, which allowed them to estimate that phases 1 and 2 would take 150 person-years to complete, so with a crew of 20, the plan seemed doable.\nAt this point, Cyc was still based on frames, like AM and EURISKO. Each frame corresponded roughly to a concept. Each new article encoded took “dozens” of new frames, but they expected it to drop to around 0.1 frames per article after the first 1000s of articles, indicating they expected the final Cyc to contain about 50K concepts.\nSuch a project was way beyond a typical academic project, or even a commercial project. Fortunately, the Japan scare of the 1980s created a flood of funding for AI projects, and Cyc got funding for the next 10 years, freed from both academic and commercial interests.\n\n5 years later, Lenat optimistically wrote the “midterm” report that the project was still on schedule, that the knowledge pump would be primed by 1995. (D. B. Lenat and Guha 1990)\nThe most important change was what Lenat called “from the black to the white”. Instead of encoding what is written in the encyclopedias, they really should encode what is not written. Encyclopedias don’t teach what everyone knows, but to make sense of it, one must already know what “everyone knows”. What Cyc should have is not the black ink, but the white space around the black ink.\nLenat began building Cyc by setting himself a seemingly modest challenge. He picked a pair of test sentences that Cyc would eventually have to understand: “Napoleon died in 1821. Wellington was greatly saddened.” To comprehend them, Cyc would need to grasp such basic concepts as death, time, warfare, and France, as well as the sometimes counterintuitive aspects of human emotion, such as why Wellington would be saddened by his enemy’s demise. Lenat and a few collaborators began writing these concepts down and constructing a huge branching-tree chart to connect them. They produced a gigantic list of axiomatic statements–fundamental assumptions–that described each concept in Cyc’s database: its properties, how it interacted with other things. “We took enormous pieces of white paper,” Lenat remembers, “and filled walls, maybe 150 feet long by about 8 feet high, with little notes and circles and arrows and whatnot.”\n(Thompson 2001)\nThey have also estimated that it takes about 80 minutes to encode a single rule, including the overhead for knowledge elicitation up front, and the overhead for debugging and testing (D. B. Lenat 2022a).\nWith these lessons learned, they confidently claimed that they have encoded 1M assertions, 50K concepts, with 0.1% of common sense done. They expected that 10–50% was necessary for knowledge pump to be primed, which they expected to be done by 1995 – still on schedule,6 and they looked forward to the day, around 2000, when “no one would even think about having a computer that doesn’t have Cyc running on it” (D. B. Lenat and Guha 1989).\n6 Presumably at that point, Cyc would stop imagining everyone is a friend of Lenat but not of gravity. Growing up truly comes with some terrible disillusionments.\nWhen a natural-language understanding researcher was first trying to represent the concept of falling, he translated “X fell” as “Gravity carried X downward.” Elsewhere in his system was a rule that if you fell in a river and could not swim, and had no friends to rescue you, you drowned. Since gravity as a force of nature has neither arms, legs nor friends, it meets its unfortunate – and improbable – end.\n… sometime in 1994 or 1995 by Lenat’s hopeful reckoning – Cyc reaches the breakeven level of about 10 million facts. At that point, it will be able to pick up new knowledge more readily by reading than by having knowledge engineers spoon-feed it. A wider information base may also save Cyc from such gaffes as concluding (from everybody it knew about) that all humans in the world are friends of Doug Lenat.\n(Wallich 1991)\nThey expected that the finished Cyc would know 1M concepts. Why 1M? They held their own “mini-Dartmouth conference” and found that multiple estimates all suggest the 1M number (D. B. Lenat and Feigenbaum 1991):\n\n\nAround 1990, a large rewrite occurred, resetting some progress. This was expected. As Lenat later claimed, they had met about 150 technical obstacles along the way, and had cleared them all away by 1990, and it remained to just add more knowledge. (D. B. Lenat 2009, 2022a) The most important technical obstacles that they conquered were as follows.\nInstead of an object-oriented frame-and-slots language like EURISKO and AM, use a fully general higher-order logic language. This is necessary because people can do common sense higher-order reasoning: modals, reflection, pros and cons, counterfactual hypotheticals, contexts as first-class objects in our ontology, several different useful “species” of negation, etc. (D. B. Lenat 2022a)\nInstead of searching for the right representation, use as many representations for concepts and rules as you need. Each is represented in at least two ways. This is necessary for efficient inference. Similarly, use as many inference engines as needed, since the general logic engine is too slow. They had already 20 at that point, and they would eventually end up with >1100. (D. B. Lenat 2022a)\nDon’t try to make the perfect “upper ontology”. It just has to be good enough. A “suboptimal” one only causes a constant factor \\(O(1)\\) of waste in computational space and time.\nWe even wasted quite a bit of time trying to get the very most general tip of Cyc’s concept network “right”… at the 1986 Fifth-Generation Project conference in Tokyo, when we saw the ontology built by Japan’s answer to Cyc, named Electronic Dictionary Research (EDR). Their topmost distinction was between things with souls and things without souls. And large trees were in the former category, whereas small trees were in the latter category… They and their EDR system knew that both types of trees needed water and sunlight and had roots, etc., they just had to represent each of those assertions as two separate rules instead of one, as we did in Cyc. No big deal.\nThe important lesson was: Making suboptimal ontology choices just means that your ontology and knowledge base might have to be bigger, more verbose, to make up for those missed generalization opportunities.\n(D. B. Lenat 2022a)\nIn the progress report in 1995, they stated that they had manually re-entered in the new language 100K concepts and 1M assertions into Cyc in the new language, at the price of 100 person-years. Furthermore, the knowledge pump was close to being primed, and they expect Cyc to start learning on its own by reading (“natural language understanding”) and discovery (“machine learning”) sometime in the next 10 years. (D. B. Lenat 1995b) In another essay, Lenat optimistically predicted that “The goal of a general artificial intelligence is in sight, and the 21st-century world will be radically changed as a result.” (D. B. Lenat 1995a)\nBefore this point, the Cyc project was part of a private-public consortium and funded accordingly. After this point, the consortium was mostly over, so Lenat spun out Cyc into a for-profit company, Cycorp, to continue the work. Most academic publications ceased at this point, and I had to rely on OSINT/cyberstalking at this point to piece together what happened afterwords, by watching every Lenat talk, reading every news report, and digging up every gossip by ex-Cyclists in long-dead forums.7\n7 Most papers published after that point were slim on details, and mostly about yet new exciting ways for them to ingest more data from the Internet, or about yet more ways to use their knowledge base. I could find no information about how the inference engines worked, and very little details of commercial applications. Most of the “applications” were vaporware, with dead links everywhere.\nIt was 2001. The Internet was thriving even though most dot-com startups had died, and Lenat planned to harness the wisdom of the online crowd – much like Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia, which launched in the same year. Cyc at that point had 1.5M assertions, and had begun to be partly “tutored” in natural language by the Cyclists, which was more pleasant than typing everything up in pure CycL. Lenat optimistically predicted that the Internet crowd would be entering 10M assertions in 2002, accelerating from there, so that Cyc would know 100M assertions by 2007, at which point it would know as many things as a typical human. Then by 2011, Cyc would have learned, by reading and chatting with people, all that humanity collectively knows. From there on, Cyc will extend the knowledge frontier by running novel experiments in a research lab. (Thompson 2001; Anthes 2002b) Other reports suggested that AGI, or what he called a “generally intelligent artifact” would arrive by 2020 or 2025. (Port 1997; Lyons 1998)\nHe draws me a graph that shows Cyc’s learning curve. From 1985 to 2000, the line curves upward gradually – the “brain surgery” phase during which the Cyclists input knowledge by hand. But then at 2001, the curve steepens dramatically as the open-source phase takes over, and thousands – or millions – more inputters join in. Lenat extends the curve maybe ten years into the future. As the curve reaches the point where Cyc has read everything there is to read and spoken with everyone willing to tell it facts, it will begin to flatten out. “It’ll know all there is to know,” he says. “At that point, the only way it could learn more is by doing experiments itself.”\n(Thompson 2001)\nTo drum up the support, Cycorp released OpenCyc in 2001, a small subset of Cyc. Lenat planned to migrate everything to the public mode. But OpenCyc would always lag the true Cyc by 24 to 30 months. (Anthes 2002b) Unfortunately, this was not to be the case. The last version of OpenCyc was released in 2012, and it quietly shut down with no fanfare, probably in 2017-03, with a curt message:\nPart of the Cyc technology was released, starting in 2001, as OpenCyc, which provided an API, RDF endpoint, and data dump, under appropriate Apache and Creative Commons open source licenses. Its distribution was discontinued in early 2017 because such “fragmenting” led to divergence, and led to confusion amongst its users and the technical community generally that that OpenCyc fragment was Cyc.\nOpenCyc was primarily a subset of the knowledge base. As described in the Handbook, the base contained 3 sections:\n\nConcurrent with OpenCyc, there was also ResearchCyc, which contained the non-proprietary parts of Cyc, but only available for research purposes. It shutdown sometime in 2019, without even a curt message.\nAs one can expect from Lenat’s previous non-releases, there was and has never been any release of Cyc itself, especially because Cyc is a commercial endeavor, as is necessary to sustain the 2000 person-year project.\nIn 2001, at the start of the Semantic Web hype (the original “Web 3.0”, before it came to mean cryptographic blockchains), Cycorp began seriously engaging with the many Semantic Web initiatives.\nSquinting a bit, the visions of the semantic web and the vision of the Cyc were the same: Both wish to draw connections between data, such that computer programs can chain together multiple operations on data, synthesize them, and give the user what they meant, instead of what they literally typed out. Cycorp regarded the semantic web effort as doing essentially the same thing, on the Internet scale, except with a less expressive frame language (not even first-order logic). During the 2000s, papers from Cycorp often talked of integrating Cyc with the semantic web by encoding knowledge in DAML, RDF, OWL, XML, or some other boring acronym.\nCycorp participated in the Standard Upper Ontology Working Group (SUO WG), which, like most Working Groups, petered out in 2003 among motions, procedures, and consensus-buildings, filled with meticulous wisdoms and benevolent safeguarding of the metaphysics of mankind. What it did provide is the earliest copy of OpenCyc I have found, in 2003, which I have backed up for safekeeping.\nWith the breakout success of the ESP game in 2003, “games with a purpose” were all the rage, so Cyc attempted to keep up with the times with its own FACTory in 2005. It never got out of the Beta version 1.0.1 and shut down sometime after 2012. According to the tutorial, it was a single player game, where the player just selects whether the statement is true, false, doesn’t make sense, or the player doesn’t know. The answers are scored based on the majority of answers. Though Lenat stated in a lecture that they had players that raked up 50 hours a month to the point that Lenat felt concerned about it, I could not find any mention of how much data they have gathered from this game in total. Nevertheless, this appeared to be the only time Cyc crowd-sourced data.\nIn 2006, Cycorp spun out The Cyc Foundation, a non-profit organization promote the OpenCyc + Semantic Web combo. As usual, nothing ever came of it. The last blogpost went up in 2011-06, and the website shutdown in 2015.\n\nIn 2008, Cycorp tried again by putting up a copy of OpenCyc with a user interface and an API, branded as “OpenCyc for the Semantic Web”. The API would allow web agents to call on OpenCyc and use the replies to do Semantic Web things, making it “the backbone of semantic web”… at least that was the hope. An exhaustive Google search turned up zero actual applications. It shut down in 2017 when OpenCyc did.\nThough deprived of its purported backbone, from our vantage point, the Semantic Web has arrive as promised, but instead of the dream of Cyc-like thinkers performing long queries over databases, we have forgetful agent swarms talking with each other with API calls, dying, RESTing, and reincarnating, a game of Memento on the global scale.\nIn 2008, Cycorp tried again by joining the Large Knowledge Collider (LarKC)8 project at Europe, “a platform for massive distributed incomplete reasoning that will remove the scalability barriers of currently existing reasoning systems for the Semantic Web”. The hope was to produce a common knowledge base with over 1 billion triples, such that it can easily be scaled up further, and easy to produce expert systems based on it. A few papers and conferences later, the project ended in 2011.\n8 The name is an obvious shade to the Large Hadron Collider, which began operation in 2009 and was briefly in the popular imagination.\nThere was another blog by Cycorp starting in 2008, that stopped updating in 2011 after 11 unremarkable posts. It was supposedly written by Cycorp, though its style was the same forgettably respectable style as that of the Cyc Foundation and parliamentary proceedings.\nThere was a Twitter bot @cyc_ai​, which started in 2008 and stopped in 2011 after 15764 inane tweets in the format of “I just leaned <statement>, true or false?”. According to Internet Archive, it shut down sometime before 2017.\nAs you might have noticed if you clicked on any of the above links, almost all the links are dead now. By checking the last known good copy of the various websites on Internet Archive, I noticed that there was a “massive extinction event” during 2014–2016, when Cycorp purged most of the open information about Cyc from the Internet. No more OpenCyc, tutorials, references, vocabulary lists, The Ontological Engineer’s handbook (version 0.7)…9 everything was gone, except marketing material. Fortunately, the Internet Archive exists, and I scraped much of the primary material from it and uploaded them to GitHub for safekeeping.\n9 There is a funny anecdote about this book:\nI coined the phrase “ontological engineer” in the mid-1980’s, shortly after embarking on the construction of Cyc, because I didn’t like the pejorative tone of “knowledge enterer” or “knowledge worker”, and the term “knowledge engineer” had already been taken (to mean someone who builds expert systems). Based on that, when Addison-Wesley published our 1989 Cyc book (Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems), the editor playfully inserted a forward reference, at the front, under Other Publications, to the 1997 Ontological Engineer’s Handbook. Of course the joke was on us when, starting in 1997, we began to be deluged by requests for that nonexistent work.\n(D. B. Lenat 2005)\nWhy?\nI believe it was for commercial reasons. This mass extinction event closely corresponded to the commercialization wave in 2016, when Lenat finally declared the Cyc project “done” and set about commercializing it, both via Cycorp and via Lucid.ai, a company founded a year before.\n“Part of the reason is the doneness of Cyc,” explains Lenat, who left his post as a professor at Stanford to start the project in late 1984. “Not that there’s nothing else to do,” he says. But he notes that most of what is left to be added is relevant to a specific area of expertise, such as finance or oncology. Among other projects, [Lucid] is developing a personal assistant equipped with Cyc’s general knowledge. This could perhaps lead to something similar to Siri. … the CEO of Lucid says the new company is in talks with various others interested in using the Cyc knowledge base. Lucid has been working with the Cleveland Clinic, for example, to help automate the process of finding patients for clinical studies.\n(Knight 2016)\nThis timing of commercialization coincides suspiciously with the end of almost all projects except ResearchCyc. Even the documentation went offline in 2016 and could now only be accessed for commercially registered accounts! It looks like a total internal pivot as the company focused on commercialization and shut down all services that were not high priority for the bottom line.\nAfter cyberstalking the Cyc for days, I had captured every numerical datapoint that has ever dripped out of Cycorp over its entire existence, and combined them into a spreadsheet that you can analyze yourself. In short, Cyc has grown to 30M assertions over the years, and is still incomplete, if completeness were measured by its original standard – a self-learning AGI. Despite Lenat’s 2016 claim that it was “done”, there is no self-learning or AGI in sight.\n\nLooking at this diagram, we notice 3 things:\nOne, the growth of assertions is roughly exponential, doubling every 6 years. At this rate, in 2032 Cyc can expect to reach 100M assertions, the hoped-for point at which Cyc would know as much as a typical human. This might be the dream of Lenat, but I bet it will just become a slightly bigger enterprise solution to expertise management.\nTwo, the cost of human labor has remained stable throughout the existence of Cycorp, at $100K/person-year.\nThree, The cost of assertions was $5/assertion from 1990–2010, but $0.7/assertion after 2015, around the time when Lenat declared the project mostly complete. This matches the estimate of (Paulheim 2018). It’s unclear what caused the 7-fold increase in efficiency. Perhaps this is a success of “priming the knowledge pump”, or this might just because after 2015, most new assertions came from adding new assertions specialized to particular commercial applications, and thus were easier to handle. Formalizing business rules already written down is easier than extracting the intuitive metaphysics of fruits vs vegetables, after all. In any case, a 7-fold efficiency improvement over 30 years is unimpressive, and indistinguishable from more prosaic arguments about learning curve effects observed in most industries: The more you make, the cheaper you can make.\nThe Cyc system consists of three main kinds of parts:\nTo increase speed and compatibility, the programs written in CycL are compiled to Java, which is then compiled to bytecode.\nThe CycL language is intended to be the high-level language that humans can read and write, at the “Epistemological Level” (EL). Most inference engines do not process CycL directly, but process low-level translations of CycL at the “Heuristic Level” (HL). Each sentence at the EL can be translated into a multitude of HL sentences, since different translations allow different inference engines to process it, so that hopefully at least one of those would process it efficiently. The two sides are connected by an interface called the “Canonicalizer”.\n\n\nSince the CycL language has had been developed since the late 1980s, and Cycorp published very little, I am basing this section mostly on the Ontological Engineer’s Handbook (version 0.7), which seemed to contain the most details, even though technically it only describes the 2002 version of CycL.\nLike Common Lisp, the CycL language has almost no syntax:\n10 A technical detail is that as soon as you enter an expression that uses #$thereExists, Cyc automatically “Skolemizes” that expression, because existential quantifiers are technically inconvenient. For example, if I were to say “There exists a time at which Socrates dies.”, then it would be very awkward when someone asks “When?” and I have no recourse but to reply “… there exists!”. Skolemization means that I would instead define a function #$DateOfDeath. Then any time someone asks “When?”, I need simply reply “(#$DateOfDeath #$Socrates)!”.\nThis is enough for us to start writing some assertions that would imply “Socrates is mortal”.\nAssertions can be packaged into a microtheory (Mt, aka a context), which could be thought of as scopes or modules. Each assertion can belong to exactly one microtheory, though you can have two assertions that are literally typed out using the same symbols occur in two microtheories – and they would count as two logical assertions.\nAssertions can, and often need, to be automatically inferred across microtheories. For example, “Socrates is alive.” is true in the context of 500 BC, but not in the context of 1995. Given an assertion to the effect of “Socrates was born in 470 BC and died in 399 BC”, an automatic process would allow the system to automatically infer assertions “Socrates is alive” for every microtheory from “The time is 470 BC” to “The time is 399 BC”, and “Socrates is not alive” for the other microtheories.\nAs one might expect from the above example, it is unnecessary, and indeed impractical, to create all microtheories that one might ever use. Indeed, many microtheories are created and destroyed for one-time-use “on the spot”. For a single problem-and-answer session with a user, Cyc typically sets up a temporary context that is deleted after the session, or saved if the user wishes to continue the session later.\nMicrotheories are necessary because human beliefs are incompatible, and there are a lot of humans. For example (very relevant, considering how much Cyc was involved with the War on Terror), #$ChristianMt and #$IslamMt could have:\nMicrotheories can contain each other. For example, both are #$AbrahamicMt, which allows us to make assertions that apply to both.\nAs of 2010, there were over 20K microtheories arranged in a hierarchy, with BaseKB at the top. It was unfortunately a mess, as Lenat promised. Some microtheories were 50 levels deep down the hierarchy!\n… determining the hierarchical structure of the Mt’s is difficult, manual, and error prone because all of the Mt’s in ResearchCyc are direct subtypes of BaseKB, even if they are also its indirect subtypes. For example, Mt ClothingGMt describes general information about clothing and is a direct subtype of BaseKB. It is also an indirect subtype of BaseKB because it is a subtype of ArtifactGMt, also a subtype of ArtifactGVocabularyMt, which, in turn, is a subtype of BaseKB… Choosing the right microtheory can easily take several minutes for a trained ontologist who is familiar with the Cyc ontology and experienced in how best to organize knowledge for maximum utility.\n(Conesa, Storey, and Sugumaran 2010)\nThe Ontology of Cyc is the graph of all concepts in Cyc, with one directed edge per (#$genls #$Thing1 #$Thing2) assertion. At least, that’s the simplest possible way to say it. In fact, the graph is more complicated, since CycL is a higher-order logic, which allows it to talk about the relation between relations between predicates, etc. For example, both #$SetOrCollection and #$MathematicalObject are sub-concepts of #$MathematicalThing, but we also need to specify that any #$MathematicalThing is either a #$SetOrCollection xor a #$MathematicalObject.\nThe ontology contains multiple levels. At the upper level are the most metaphysical concepts, starting with #$Thing, going down to the middle level of #$Language and #$MilitaryOrganization.\n\nBelow the upper ontology are domain-specific knowledge, divided into large microtheories (minitheories?). There would be knowledge about mortgages, computer security, weapons systems, pathology, etc. Below those are the domain-specific facts and data, divided into microtheories. The entire thing is structured like a pyramid.\n\nAs an example, here is how #$Philosopher is described in OpenCyc:\nA specialization of #$Person; in the context of #$HumanActivitiesMt this collection is an instance of #$PersonTypeByActivity, in the context of #$JobMt it is an instance of #$PersonTypeByOccupation. Each instance of #$Philosopher is a person who habitually thinks about philosophical matters such as what is or might be, what we can know, how we can know anything, etc. In the contemporary era most philosophers are academics or professionals, but a significant number (now and historically) don’t fit this profile.\nAnd here’s the #$Thing:\n#$Thing is the “universal collection”: the collection which, by definition, contains everything there is. Every thing in the Cyc ontology – every #$Individual (of any kind), every #$Set-Mathematical, and every #$Collection – is an instance of (see #$isa) #$Thing. Similarly, every collection is a subcollection of (see #$genls) #$Thing. Trivially, #$Thing is both an instance of and a subcollection of itself, and is not a subcollection of any other collection. (Note that the above reference to “every thing in the Cyc ontology” is not meant to be limited to things actually reified in the Cyc system, but includes (e.g.) every instance – reified or not, known or not – of every collection recognized by Cyc.)\nAnd if the parenthetical note sounds a bit theological,11 note that among those that Cycorp had hired included philosophers, botanists, chemists, and of course, theologians. Interestingly, they didn’t ask botanists to encode what they know about botany, but about what they know about non-botany. Lenat’s theory was that botanists’ understanding of botany is not commonsensical. Instead, what botany he wanted Cyc to encode is common sense botany: how non-botanists think about plants – even, and especially, those botanical beliefs that a botanist would consider wrong, such as (#$not (#$isa #$Banana #$BotanicalBerry)).\n11 I did not find any mention of Meinong in Lenat’s corpus or Cycorp’s communications, but this description sounds close to Meinong’s Jungle, where every thing exists, even logically impossible things such as “a square circle”. The metaphysical difficulties are many, but presumably Cyc has tamed the jungle in practice.\n12 This reminds me of an event very early on in the history of Cyc:\nCyc apparently believed that if a bronze statue were melted into slag, it would remain a statue. What had gone wrong? … Cyc had been told that bronze was a material that retained its essential property – its “bronzeness,” as it were – no matter what state it was in, solid or liquid. But now Cyc was trying to apply that fact to the statue aspect of “bronze statue”. Cyc hadn’t been told anything about statues that would invalidate its conclusion; nobody had ever thought it necessary to tell Cyc, for example, that statues are only statues if they’re more or less in their original form.\n(Thompson 2001)\nTo a philosopher, this would have been funny, because Cyc had just been ambushed by Aristotle’s bronze statue! See especially Physics 195a6-8 and Metaphysics 1045a26-29. Aristotle solved it by hylomorphism. I wonder how Cyc solved it?\nUnfortunately for ontology, while everyone has a common sense, few can pull it out of their heads and push it into a computer. Let’s consider how Cyc encodes events via “Davidsonian semantics”, since it’s how Donald Davidson represented events – yes, Cyc hired a lot of philosophy PhDs. While everyone can reason about events commonsensically, implicitly, making it explicit required a Davidson.12\nTo represent “John gave Mary a book.”, you can write something like (#$Give #$John #$Mary #$Book1), but this prevents you from adding more details, because for the assertion to be syntactically correct, you must define #$Give to be a predicate with arity exactly 3. And then you’d be stuck if you want to write “John gave Mary a book last August.”, since there is no arity in #$Give to insert the “last August” into. And even if you redefine #$Give to have arity 4, what if you also want to say it happened in the library, or that it was a gift, or that John was happy about it? You’d have to change the definition of the predicate #$Give again and again, and there is no end to this.\nTo solve this problem, Cyc treats the event itself as an #$Event. That is, it reifies the process as an object. Now, instead of cramming everything into one assertion, you can construct an endless sequence of assertions, limited only by your patience:\nSuch problems are fairly subtle, and the world is a very big place. Fortunately, Lenat was a master of ontology, so it all worked out in the end.\n… during a short stint working with Doug Lenat’s Cyc project. At the time, they were trying to encode all of botany and had a small staff of professional botanists doing knowledge entry. Naturally it was quite difficult for the botanists to try to translate their knowledge into the formalisms required by Cyc, and they would regularly puzzle over various questions… and if they could not come to a consensus, would have to take it before the Master, Doug Lenat, who would think for a bit, maybe draw some diagrams on a whiteboard, and come up with the Right Representation.\n— AMMDI: alpha ontologist (2023-10-07)\nTo a mathematician, 1 and 1 trillion are the same – both are finite. To computer scientists, even \\(x^2\\) and \\(x^3\\) are different. Much work on Cyc was not on building the 100M-assertion knowledge base, but on building inference engines that allow fast inferences when there are 100M assertions to pick from.\nEvery logical system must face an impossible trilemma:\nWhy a trilemma?\nSuppose we want to allow Cyc express all common sense assertions, then since humans in their daily life say high-order statements like “Are you implying that you meant to make me upset by spreading rumors about her, when you had known all along that I would soon hear about it?”, Cyc needs to use a higher-order language. Now this immediately makes it impossible to have an inference engine that is both complete and computable, since we have a Gödel-style incompleteness theorem (Shapiro 1991, theorem 4.14).\nLenat chose to use a fully higher-order language, giving up completeness, and then try his best improving efficiency.\nLike most expert systems, the Cyc has a general resolution-based inference engine. Unlike most expert systems, its knowledge base is large and higher-ordered, so its general engine runs too slowly for most queries. Thus, the developers kept adding more specialized modules (“pattern-specific heuristic modules”), each capable of efficiently inferring on a few microtheories. If a specialized engine fails to make progress, a more general engine can be the fall-back, all the way up to the most general one.\nAs the simplest example of how inference engine can work, consider the following example of backward-chaining inference, in a semantic web. The system is asked basically “Why does Clyde want to possess a crescent wrench?”, and it eventually replies “Because Clyde has not eaten lately.”. Lenat expected that the ontology of Cyc would eventually power generally intelligent agents, which would use forward-chaining to construct goals from current states, and use backward-chaining to explain why others have their goals.\n\nMost inference engines are highly specialized. They can only reason within a few microtheories, but very well. Here is a toy example for reasoning with mutually exclusive categories. We can define #$Mutex as\nThen this allows the general reasoning engine to reason about mutual exclusivity by always reducing to this definition. However, we can accelerate this by adding in some “lemmas”:\nAfter producing enough lemmas, we can then write a specialized inference engine that would be invoked whenever #$Mutex appears in an expression, and it would attempt some inference and simplifications by applying these lemmas. Indeed, most inference engines were constructed in this way: Cyc would try to solve a problem, and fails by timing out. The ontologists at Cyc would call up a human expert and ask, “How did you do this?” and the expert would explain how they would solve it with quick rules of thumb, which the ontologists would write into Cyc, resulting in more assertions, and possibly more inference engines. This is essentially the same as “knowledge elicitation” used for making expert systems.\nOther than these inference engines (or “workers”), there are also many “tacticians”, modules that pick engines that are probably good for solving a problem, and a general all-powerful strategist at the very top. It was reported in that there were 1 strategist, 4 tacticians, and 1097 workers. The strategist and tacticians have parameters that can vary, presumably by the user or the ontologists in order to adapt to specific tasks. (D. B. Lenat et al. 2007)\nThe control structure of Cyc is a commercial secret.13 I could only find two brief explanations of it, one in a 2010 Cycorp white paper, another in an essay published near the end of his life (D. B. Lenat 2022a). According to these, Cyc coordinates the ~1000 inference engines with blackboard architecture similar to the one used in Hearsay-II speech recognition system (Erman et al. 1980). Lenat described it as:\n13 The SubLisp reference was titled “control structure”, and got me excited for a moment. But I was disappointed to find that it described the control structure of the SubLisp programming language (mostly the same as that of Common Lisp), not of the Cyc system.\nthere is a whole battery of specialized inference engines and representations… and, when making progress, broadcasting the results… Whenever progress is made, all of them stop and work on the now-simpler subproblem. Some of the inference engines are very general, and work on general representations–e.g., a theorem prover that works on first-order logic. The more specialized inference engines are much faster whenever they do apply… In 1986, Cyc had two such representations; by 1990, there were 20, each with its own inference engine; today Cyc has over 1100. They work together as a community of agents, communicating by posting their intermediate results on a sort of blackboard that all the other agents can watch and react to if/when/as they see an opportunity that fits their specialty.\n(D. B. Lenat 2022a)\n\nYou can imagine a shared working space – the blackboard – where agents can scan and find tasks to do, do them, and then post the outputs to the blackboard. Each agent has their own “places to watch”. They notice (or get notified) what is posted to their watched areas, and ignore what is outside.14 When an agent completes whatever task it is running, it posts the outputs to particular areas of the board to notify certain agents, “Hey, check this out! I bet you’ll find this helpful.”. To prevent race conditions or general conflict between agents, an agent can claim a lock on something, so that other agents can’t work on it until it times out, or releases the lock.\n14 Lenat seemed to suggest that each inference engine watches the entire board, but every large-scale blackboard system I know of doesn’t do that. Hearsay-II certainly did not. It is slow and creates much of unintended complexities. Imagine a microservice where every process pings every process whenever it outputs something, or a conference where everyone broadcasts to everyone.\nYou can imagine this as a microservices framework, with over 1100 microservices, multicast, with SubLisp as the serialization language. Indeed, apparently some of the inference engines used neural networks, so their numerical outputs definitely had to be serialized somehow into SubLisp.\nThe blackboard is also connected to the “external world” through API calls. For example, SQL queries run by an external database can return data that is posted to a region of the blackboard, and what Cyc writes to the blackboard can be read out for external use.\nAccording to a 2006 lecture (D. B. Lenat 2006), the blackboard has 12 “dimensions”, because each assertion occurs in a kind of context, and there are 12 dimensions to the context: Anthropacity, Time, GeoLocation, TypeOfPlace, TypeOfTime, Culture, Sophistication/Security, Topic, TopicGranularity, Modality/Disposition/Epistemology, Argument-Preference, and Justification. For example, “Ronald Reagan is president” is true in the context Time = 1985, GeoLocation = UnitedStates, etc. These 12 dimensions were detailed in a 1998 technical report, though in that report, Anthropacity was called a “pseudo-dimension”, and replaced by Let's. (D. Lenat 1998)\nOther than the slightly anarchic microservice structure, Cyc could also use Simple Hierarchical Ordered Planner to run the engines in order, if the workflow for how the engines should be run is known.\nIt was known very early on that the most general inference engine is the slowest, which is why they settled on a multi-layered structure of inference engines. Each inference is handled by the lowest engines first, and upon failing, the higher-levels try it.\nFurther, to allow the tacticians know who to call, and the engines to know whether it is powerful enough to handle the query, the user can specify in a query over 150 adjustable parameters, such as max time limit, max number of answers desired, max number of backward-chaining steps, whether to introduce new terms, etc. In 2007, they found 6 combinations of these parameters that could answer almost all queries they tested with, which allowed them to clean up the user interface. Not a form with 150 blanks, but just a pick-1-in-6. (D. B. Lenat 2022b)\nThough there is a most general inference engine on the very top, they had noticed by 2007 that was so slow that turning it off made the system go faster! So they turned it off entirely in 2010. (D. B. Lenat 2022b; D. B. Lenat and Marcus 2023)\nThe heaven is high and the emperor is far away. The monologic is dead. Long live the swarm.\nAs a user, the knowledge base would be worth nothing if you cannot ask it questions and receive answers. The Cyc system, like most logical programming systems, answers queries by logical unification. That is, it converts a query into a logical formula \\(\\phi(x)\\) with a certain unknown \\(x\\), then returns all \\(x\\) that makes \\(\\phi(x)\\) true, or if no such \\(x\\) exists, then returns FALSE.\nFor a query like\nthe Cyc system applies various inference engines to find all bindings (aka substitutions) of the variable ?WHAT that make the statement true in the knowledge base. The results will include all Canadian provinces and territories that have been asserted explicitly or can be inferred through rules.\nCyc provides 3 types of queries:\nTo illustrate how querying works in practice, consider a scenario where we want to find all Canadian provinces. An ASK query would look like:\nCyc processes this by looking for all terms (symbols that begin with #$) that satisfy the predicate when plugged into the variable ?WHAT. The system might use transitivity rules, inheritance mechanisms, and various specialized inference engines to gather results. Behind the scenes, Cyc might employ backward-chaining to start from the query and work backward to known facts, or forward-chaining to derive new facts from existing ones, depending on which approach its tacticians determine is more efficient. The reply would be something like\nWhen Cyc performs a query, it can also provide a deductive trace (forma proof) showing how it reached its conclusion. For example, when proving that Manitoba is a Canadian province, the deductive trace might look like:\nFor more complex queries involving logical implications, PROVE creates hypothetical microtheories to test universal claims. Such microtheories are useful, since the hypotheticals being considered are usually temporary and should not be mixed with the permanent assertions in the knowledge base. For example, to ask “Is every Canadian province a political subdivision of Canada?”, we use:\nPROVE handles this by creating a temporary “possible world” where it assumes the existence of a generic Canadian province and tests whether it must also be a political subdivision of Canada.\nAs previously stated, each time the user begins a question-and-answer session with the Cyc system, it creates a new microtheory just for this session, which allows it to keep track of what has been asked and responded to, so that the user can refer to things like “your previous answer”. Such a microtheory is usually deleted after the session is over, though it can also be saved if the user wishes to continue the session at a later date.\nThe querying interface also provides controls for managing the inference process, such as limiting search depth, maximal time allowed, the inference engines to be used, the parameters for the strategist and the tacticians, etc. These can help the Cyc system to solve difficult queries when the default settings are insufficient.\nWhen it comes to the use of natural languages, there are two problems. The easy problem is to convert sentences in CycL into natural language. This is fairly simple and has been set up since around late 1990s, simply by constructing assertions between a concept and a concept of the English word for the concept. (Guha and Lenat 1993) For example, (#$genls #$Dog #$Mammal) would be transformed to “Dogs are mammals.”, and so on. Concretely, it involves entering sentences of the form (simplified):\nand similarly, Cyc could order the words correctly using logical assertions for English grammar in the form of government and binding theory.\nSure, such generated language will sound a bit wooden and formalistic, and would not win any literary award, but it solves the problem. The hard problem is to parse sentences in natural language into CycL, along with all its messiness.\nInformation about how Cyc solves the hard problem is sparse, but from what I gathered, it uses a tiered system from the fast and inaccurate to the slow and accurate.\nUnderlying all of its NLP is an English dictionary, also represented as concepts and assertions in CycL. The dictionary contains about 200K words and phrases, and more assertions about them. For example, the word “light” is represented as a concept Light-theWord, and there would be assertions stating that it can be a verb, or a noun, or an adjective, etc.\nAt the fastest tier are keyword matching, or concept spotting. For example, for parsing terrorism articles, it can just quickly match for the existence of keywords in a sentence. Seeing a sentence that looks like “… al-Qaeda … embassy … grenade … suicide attack…”, the system can assume, with high probability, what the sentence means, and generate its CycL representation.\nAt a slower tier is using extraction templates. For example, “[A] was involved in kidnapping [B]” would be matched to a template that looks for the fragment “involved in kidnapping”, which then would parse [A] as the Perpetrator while [B] as the Victim.\nAt a slower tier is example-based machine translation by syntax templates. For example, in “… the heart of Baghdad …”, the first pass parses Badhdad as a city, then a syntax template activates and it parses the “heart” as Downtown. This can be coded as\nAt the slowest tier is full syntax tree parsing. In this tier, the sentence is fully parsed to a syntax tree using a manually written transformational grammar under the government and binding theory. It is then parsed semantically using Montague grammar.\nWhereas the CycL-to-English part is already workable mostly in 2001, the English-to-CycL part is still ongoing work, a consummation devoutly to be wished. Even though Lenat originally thought natural language understanding would be finished soon after priming the knowledge pump, it has already been 8 years since the priming, and Cyc is still not reading the world’s writings and learning autonomously.\nCyc has used statistical and machine learning methods in minor parts, such as using neural networks, n-gram methods, random forest, support vector machines, etc, to automatically extract templates for natural language processing, classify the microtheories that a sentence belongs to, etc.\nHowever, none of these were at all what Lenat meant when he talked of “machine learning”, by which he meant a Cyc machine, with knowledge pump fully primed, would begin to perform experiments and learn by automated discovery, much like AM and EURISKO were meant to do. While this has always been the “phase 3” of the Cyc project, to this day, Cyc has made no progress in this area.\nIn America, at least before the Deep Learning era, the government funded most large-scale efforts in AI, usually in the context of military and intelligence applications. This was true for the Cyc project. Indeed, it initiated in 1984-07 within the Microelectronics and Computer Consortium (MCC), which, like the Strategic Computing Initiative, was formed in reaction to the threat of the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems project. Though not directly funded by the government, its head was Bobby Inman, who had previously held high positions in the Navy, the NSA, and the CIA, so draw your own conclusion.\nIn 1995-01, as MCC wound down, the Cyc group formed Cycorp Inc., a for-profit company, to continue their mission. Immediately after that point, academic publication and generally candid conversation almost ceased. Who bought the services of Cyc, and for what? The details are slim. Trade secrets, no doubt. Confirmed results:15\n15 I swear I’m not a policy wonk, but 3 days of cyc-berstalking does take its toll.\nLooking at the list, we see that much of Cycorp funding came from the American intelligence community, especially between 2001 and 2010, during the heights of the War on Terror, as the American state struggled to expand its sovereign eye over the sprawling cyberspace. Indeed, one of the early success was when it “predicted anthrax might be sent through the mail six months before trove of knowledge about past terrorist activities, tactics, and weapons”. (Hawkins 2003) Though the success did not help anyone, it was great advertisement.16 Corroborating, Lenat in a 2006 Google Talk showed screenshots of Cyc answering “Which American city would be most vulnerable to an anthrax attack during summer?”. (The answer was “Phoenix”.)\n16 But there’s also this:\nOnce, developing a scenario for a terrorist attack on Hoover Dam, it hypothesized a school of 1,000 al Qaeda-trained dolphins bearing explosives.\n(Hawkins 2003)\n\nThe total funding of the project is hard to know, although we know that in 2002, its total cost had been $60M, of which $25M came from the military, so I think it’s fair to say 50% came from the military. This is corroborated in 2005:\nIn 1996, we got our first substantial government contract,” Lenat recalls. Since then, Cycorp has collected about half of its revenue from U.S. government agencies and the rest from companies, mostly for building “semantic maps” that help users pull information from various databases with a single query. By taking on paying projects, Cycorp has been able to stay profitable and debt-free. All of the firm’s stock is owned by its employees, making Cycorp answerable only to Cycorp. “But,” Lenat admits, “we have had to tack with the funding winds. Maybe 50 percent of the funding we get pushes us forward in the direction that we need to go.”\nCycorp doesn’t even want to be distracted by the rigors of the retail software business; instead, it licenses Cyc for use in third-party software packages… The time may come, Lenat says, when a greatly expanded Cyc will underlie countless software applications. But reaching that goal could easily take another two decades.\n(Wood 2005)\nOut of all these applications, only two had been reported in detail.\nThe first application is the Terrorism Knowledge Base (TKB), created in 2004 and shut down in 2008. (Cycorp 2008) During the aftermath of 9/11, the American government funded a massive expansion of surveillance and data processing, and the Cycorp took on several of such contracts. The TKB is the only one about which we know in some detail.\nThe system can be browsed like a local Wikipedia – if Wikipedia were focused entirely on terrorism. TKB contained >2000 terrorists, >700 terrorist groups, >6500 terrorist attacks, and >200,000 assertions such as “Xavier Djaffor participated in the Jihad from 1996 to 2000” and “Lashkar-e-Taiba is an Islamist terror group founded in 1990”.\n\nA user query would be processed in 4 steps.\n\nLike querying, data entry also has a light amount of parsing, and the system attempts to fill a form with it. The user can then fix the form. An intelligence specialist, lightly trained in using it, could enter up to 100 assertions per hour.\n\nThe second application took place at the Cleveland Clinic, sometime during 2007–2010.17 The system was called “Semantic Research Assistant” (SRA), and it could answer queries about cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac catheterization, and percutaneous coronary intervention – basically, surgery-relevant questions about the heart.\n17 This paper is the only substantial public information about this collaboration I can find. Therefore, I can only confirm that Cyc had been used in Cleveland Clinic during 2007–2010. It may have lasted to at least 2021, since (Cycorp 2021) still cited this application.\n\n\nThere was one subsequent report on the system in 2012, which described the SemanticDB project at Cleveland, of which Cyc was only a part. The SemanticDB system contains a database of 120M semantic triples (which Lenat had long dismissed as being too limited). In the system, Cyc parses cohort identification queries written in English into formal queries, then queries the database in SPARQL, does some further inference, and shows the result. (Pierce et al. 2012) Unsurprisingly, Oracle Semantic Technologies was also involved.\nIn a presentation in 2019, Lenat claimed it required 120K new assertions for the Cleveland project, or 0.5% of the total knowledge base. However, 95% of the assertions that Cyc called up for answering queries for the project required knowledge Cyc already had, indicating large knowledge reuse (indicating that the whole project required about 2M rules).\nWell, I tried my best to look for more applications, but the fact is that there were so few of them. Out of all the confirmed instances of applications, the above two were the only ones reported in detail.\nSo far, we have only considered applications of the full Cyc system. We have mentioned that there were both the OpenCyc and the ResearchCyc, two smaller versions of the full Cyc. Did they have substantial applications? As far as I can discern, no. Indeed, just as OpenCyc failed to bring about the Semantic Web or impress the general public, ResearchCyc failed to bring about a revolution in knowledge engineering or impress the general academia, or essentially anyone outside of Cycorp itself. Even Ernest Davis and Gary Marcus, highly sympathetic to the symbolic approach to AI, found little evidence for the success of Cyc, not because Cyc had provably failed, but simply because there was too little evidence in any direction, success or failure.\n… it is in fact very difficult for an outsider to determine what has been accomplished here. In its first 15 years, CYC published astonishingly little. Since about 2002, somewhat more has been published, but still very little, considering the size of the project. No systematic evaluation of the contents, capacities, and limitations of CYC has been published. A number of organizations have done private evaluations but the results were not published.\nIt is not, for example, at all clear what fraction of CYC actually deals with commonsense inference, and what fraction deals with specialized applications such as medical records or terrorism. It is even less clear what fraction of commonsense knowledge of any kind is in CYC. … There are not even very many specific examples of commonsense reasoning carried out by CYC that have been published.\n(Davis and Marcus 2015)\nOn the whole, it is fair to say that the AI community regards CYC as a very elaborate failure. Domingos (2015 p. 51) characterizes it as “the most notorious failure in the history of AI”. Domingos is a researcher in machine learning and has little use for any kind of knowledge-based methods, so his phrasing is certainly harsh, but in our experience, this opinion, more or less, is common even in the knowledge representation (KR) community. … it would be very helpful, and it would, we believe, significantly improve CYC’s standing in the AI community, if the CYC team could demonstrate some specific task where CYC really visibly shines. … let them design their own task. As Watson demonstrates, passing a self-imposed task can be impressive enough, depending on the task, and in any case it is much better than nothing. At the moment, a person who is asked, “What interesting thing has been done with CYC?” is largely at a loss for an answer.\n(Davis 2016)\nThere is a kind of insularity in Cycorp that starts to affect you if you look too closely into it. I know I was affected. Many times I had opened a paper that purported to show the application of Cyc, and was disappointed to find that it was yet another paper about the application of a method to ingest knowledge into Cyc, rather than a method to apply knowledge out from Cyc. I came to dread the literature review, as Cyc in my mind took on the sinister appearance of a black hole at the center of the knowledge graph, a cocoon that would never metamorphose into a butterfly.\nIn (D. B. Lenat and Feigenbaum 1991), a paper coauthored with Feigenbaum, Lenat gave the most comprehensive statement for where he stands philosophically, which he held onto for the rest of his life:\nLenat is the very example of a hedgehog: a single philosophy, a vision for AGI, pursued for 40 years. One does not pursue a single vision without rejecting alternative visions, and Lenat has been explicit in rejecting every alternative route to AGI, using his sharp tongue (D. B. Lenat and Feigenbaum 1991, sec. A.2; Thompson 2001; D. B. Lenat 2008; D. B. Lenat and Marcus 2023):\nLenat had his own grand historical vision for AI, which I call the 3 Optima Theory.\nWith a little hard work (about 6 person-months), one can get a knowledge-free system working, such as self-organized neural networks, Simon and Newell’s General Problem Solver, etc. This allows the researcher to publish a quick paper, a student to earn their PhD degree, and so on. Putting in more hard work does not result in a better system, but usually makes things worse as the code becomes bloated and unmanageable. Academic myopia stops people from trying to get out of this local maximum, since people just want to get published papers.\nWith a lot more hard work (about 10 person-years), one can get a system with a lot of specialized knowledge working. This is where the commercialized expert systems live. However, the general consensus is that as an expert system grows beyond 10K rules, it starts to suffer from its weight of all the rules. Standard expert systems were built for special fields, so people would use a simple language that works, but eventually collapses under the weight of 100K rules. Commercial myopia stops people from trying to get out of this local maximum, since people just want to sell products, and 50K rules is good enough for the customer.\nThe problem is that all these efforts are wasted. Specialized expert systems cannot be glued together efficiently, because each of them lives in a differently simplified world. That is, “plateau-hopping requires breadth”. The AI field as a whole would stagnate. The only way out of this is to go for the full common sense, to invest in the 2000 person-years of effort, and make a Cyc. After that, all the expert systems can interface with Cyc, and with each other using CycL, and all the computers can be preinstalled with their digital common sense.\n\nbogosity: At CMU, bogosity is measured with a bogometer; in a seminar, when a speaker says something bogus, a listener might raise his hand and say “My bogometer just triggered”… The agreed-upon unit of bogosity is the microLenat.\nmicroLenat: The unit of bogosity. Abbreviated µL or mL in ASCII. Consensus is that this is the largest unit practical for everyday use. The microLenat, originally invented by David Jefferson, was promulgated as an attack against noted computer scientist Doug Lenat by a tenured graduate student at CMU. Doug had failed the student on an important exam because the student gave only “AI is bogus” as his answer to the questions. The slur is generally considered unmerited, but it has become a running gag nevertheless.\n— The Jargon File\nIt is hard to interpret the state of Cyc today, if we take Lenat’s word for it:18\n18 Feel free to stop reading at this point. It is about to get polemical. Indeed, I have noticed that articles have the nefarious tendency to start from the personal (“the hook”), then become informative, and then subtly slide to the polemical (“the call to action”). In fact, I have mastered the art of first scrolling the page with my eyes blurred so that the hook cannot land on my head, and then, as soon as the text utters the first syllable of the ca–[tab closed]\nAt this point, Cyc is supposed to be out there doing true machine learning (not the shallow veneer of “machine learning” that those statistical and connectionist researchers are faking). Reading and studying human text written in natural language. True intelligence. General intelligence. The foundation of a thousand expert systems. The backbone of the Semantic Web. The flowering of a new age of reason.\nAnd yet 9 years after Cyc is declared “done”, Cyc is still stuck inside the walls of Cycorp doing nothing of the kind. What is stopping Cyc from learning?\nThe finances are healthy. Cycorp is not subject to perverse interests of the market or middle managers. There are fewer employees than Dunbar’s number. They are aligned to the corporate mission. SubLisp is a great language. All technical challenges to knowledge engineering and representation had been solved by 1990. The knowledge pump is over 160% primed.\nWhat. Is. Stopping. Cyc. From. Learning??\nAccording to his final work, coauthored with Gary Marcus, the last holdup was natural language understanding (NLU). Entry had been accelerated, but was still quite manual:\nThis process has been accelerated by gamification, NLU, etc., but each axiom is hand-checked for default correctness, generality, and best placement into the microtheories (contexts) it applies to, before entering it into the Cyc knowledge base.\n(D. B. Lenat and Marcus 2023)\nThe knowledge pump had been thoroughly primed, but Cyc still couldn’t learn by reading human texts, because NLU remained unsolved. Cyc can read CycL perfectly well – the interlingua, its mother tongue – but it is stubbornly difficult to parse English into the interlingua. But why is parsing natural languages hard? Why, indeed, is NLU so difficult, even “AI-complete”?\nThis situation is clarified if we consider a classic model of machine translation, that of the Vauquois triangle: We need to translate from one language (let’s say, English) to another (let’s say, Japanese). We can translate word-for-word, which corresponds to the base of the triangle. This direct approach is of course simple but brittle. Not only does it ignore different word-ordering across languages, it would also completely fail to disambiguate homonyms, such as “fly” as a noun versus “fly” as a verb. Stopgap measures such as using n-grams lead to combinatorial explosions.\nAt a higher level, we can take account of syntax. We first parse the English sentence into a syntax tree, do a word-replacement, transform the syntax tree according to Japanese syntax, and finally generate the Japanese sentence from it. This approach would solve the “fly” vs “fly” problem, since one is a verb and another is a noun, which would be clear according to the syntax tree. However, this fails to disambiguate the word “pen” in the two sentences:\nIn both cases, the word “pen” has exactly the same syntactic category, but has a different meaning, and it requires some understanding of how the world works (i.e. that the writing-pen is too small to hold a sheep, while it is highly unlikely for someone to put ink into an animal-pen). Similarly, in the Winograd schema challenge, the task is to disambiguate what a pronoun refers to, such as deciding what the word “they” refers to in each of the two sentences:\nIndeed, Lenat had often claimed that the Winograd schema challenge is a touchstone for true language understanding, something that would prove that Cyc really understands, while unmasking the other systems’ veneers of intelligence. And how must the Winograd schema challenge be solved? Lenat’s solution is to go to the pinnacle of the triangle – interlingua, the King of Kings, the Language among Languages, a completely universal conceptual representation for all humans might wish to mean by their speech.\nLenat intended the CycL to be the interlingua.\nWithin this framework, the problems of machine translation and understanding are unified: To understand English, it remains to parse English into the interlingua. To translate Japanese to English, it remains to parse Japanese to interlingua, then verbalize interlingua into English.\n\nRecall that Lenat had always argued that “just letting a system learn on its own by natural language understanding” is a free lunch, and that NLU requires a significant portion (~10–50%) of common sense already encoded. But if that’s the case, then there is a near-contradiction here:\nOn the topic of interlingua, it is interesting that ABBYY was almost a twin of Cycorp. Whereas Cycorp began building an ontology for the common sense world since 1984, spent $200M, and got stuck on NLU since around 2010, ABBYY began building an interlingua-based machine translation system since the 1990s, and spent over $80M. By the early 2010s, they realized that they could not compete with Google statistical machine translation, and pivoted to doing NLU with semantic graph technology based on the knowledge base they produced for the sake of interlingua. (Skorinkin 2024)\nIndeed, interlingua-based machine translation projects used to be common, but essentially went extinct (except for ABBYY) after the rise of statistical machine translation in the 1990s (Hutchins 2023).\nI suspect that it is not simply the problem of getting a better English → CycL translator, and then Cyc would finally begin learning, but that much knowledge in sentences doesn’t translate to interlingua.19 If the failures of all interlingua machine translation systems is not enough evidence, then consider some more facts about Cyc’s NLU:\n19 Or that the interlingua exists, but it is not symbolic-logical, but linear-algebraic. Indeed, the successful neural machine translation systems’ latent spaces may be that consummate interlingua so devoutly wished for, but such an interlingua is very far from what you’d see in Cyc or ABBYY.\nLet’s take it another way: If there is No Free Lunch to NLU, then what is Cyc’s score on Winograd schema benchmark? Where is the Cyc-translator? Forget about Google Neural Translate – is it even better than ABBYY’s? Where’s ChatCyc? Why does none of Cyc’s commercial applications involve NLU in any significant amount, while most commercial applications of NLU use statistical or neural machine learning?\nAll evidences point to the conclusion that a sentence that can be parsed to CycL is already bureaucratic and formalistic, with the mark of interlingua written on its brow. For those, Cyc could already understand in the early 2000s, and yet, Cyc is still here, not machine-learning, lacking … what? <sarcasm>A sarcasm parser?</sarcasm>\nThe minimal description length of English is about 0.8 bits per character, and each English sentence contains about 100 characters, giving 80 bits of incompressible information. Since there are 27 characters (we are just counting the 26 lowercase letters and the whitespace), this means that the compressible information is about \\(\\log_2 27 - 0.8 = 4.0\\) bits per character.\nWe can think of writing as a process of selection: Out of all the possible letters you can pick next, you picked this particular letter, and you do it again and again. Intelligence is good selection, the careful elimination of bad choices. In this particular case, the bad choices to be eliminated come out to about 3.2 bits per character.\nNow, one might argue that the last bit is the deepest, but it is hard to square the two claims:\nStated in another way, this means 94% of the selection that humans perform while writing is mindless, mere remembering and espousing without understanding or inferring. This is even harder to square with Lenat’s assertion that 99% of language understanding is pragmatics, which self-organized NN don’t have. (D. B. Lenat 2017)\nSo does this mean that 93% of pragmatics is mindless, or are we going to just throw out the information-theoretic understanding of language as another incommensurable paradigm shift? It would fit the theme of Cyc. Indeed, they had long excised the remnants of probabilistic reasoning when they removed certainty factors at some point before 1989, since they found it inadequate compared to reasoning by logical unification (Guha and Lenat 1993). Cry “Kuhnian” and let slip the dogs of logic…\nTake another look at the list of known applications of Cyc. Then take a look at what was even planned for as “short-term uses” of Cyc even back in 1993:\nthe most promising short-term uses of Cyc are not what are traditionally considered AI problems. Instead, they are in relatively “mundane” problems such as making spreadsheets smarter, providing better access to a heterogeneous set of databases, directed marketing of goods and services, etc.\n(Guha and Lenat 1993)\nIt is quite prophetic that such “short-term uses” of Cyc are still the only uses of Cyc so far. Is 35 years considered “short-term”? Does this look like a path towards AGI, or does this look no different from building custom-made expert systems for specialized purposes, something that those generic professionals of Oracle, IBM, or Accenture have been doing for decades?\nEven though most people don’t think of the CyCorp… as an expert systems company, effectively, that’s what we’re doing… we’ve stayed in business all these years when none of you have. We are the last surviving large expert system company.\n(Expert Systems Pioneer Meeting, Day 1 Session 1: Purpose, Structure and Introductions 2018)\nPerhaps they did have a product differentiation in being able to consistently find particularly good knowledge engineers, and in programming in SubLisp, a particularly efficient language compared to Python or Java. Perhaps their product differentiation is in niche expert systems that really require higher-order statements. Perhaps these are what allowed them to stay in business despite having just a hundred-person crew. It is not something to be dismissed, but is this a path towards AGI, or a veneer of AGI cast over enterprise solutions? <sarcasm>An IBM Data Integration Solutions® with better cover art?</sarcasm>\nPerhaps Lenat could be eternally optimistic despite all the missed predictions and the lack of AGI. Perhaps it is a selection effect. One does not undertake a 40-year project for AGI without being delusionally optimistic about the prospect – the same could be said of great leaders and startup founders.\nOr perhaps he was disconnected from what was really going on down there at Cycorp. In a HackerNews discussion, some ex-Cyclists wrote what they thought about Cycorp.\nOn the pro side were many. The corporate culture was highly intellectual and philosophical, as one expects for a company that does computable ontology for a living: “it can be pretty fun to be in meetings where you try to explain Davidsonian ontology to perplexed business people”. The company had solved many technical problems in large scale inference, and remained profitable, with successful commercial applications.\nOn the con side were many. The codebase was creaking under 30 years of technical debt:\nI spent some entire days just scrolling through different versions of entire systems that duplicate massive chunks of functionality, written 20 years apart, with no indication of which (if any) still worked or were the preferred way to do things.\nThe technical solutions and commercial applications were closely guarded secrets, so the outside world does not know. Lenat was unimpressed with open source and so did not commit resources to OpenCyc, tutorials, easier third-party integration, software development kit, or other outreach projects (except those regularly scheduled newspaper reports for publicity). The Cyc culture was also insular, with a true believer’s mentality:\n… veterans there sort of feel like the broader AI community turned their back on symbolic reasoning in the 80s (fair) and they’re generally not very impressed by the current trends within the AI community, particularly w.r.t. advances in ML (perhaps unfairly so), so they’re going to just keep doing their thing until they can’t be ignored anymore.\nMost pertinent to the dream of AGI, it was unclear, down in the trenches, whether Cyc was really doing common sense reasoning, or just a particularly good base for developing expert systems from. It also wasn’t clear if common sense reasoning was really necessary for the successful commercial projects in the first place. This has caused some Cyclists to become ex-Cyclists from disillusionment.\nI personally suspect that some of Cycorp’s clients would do better with domain-specific solutions because they don’t realize how much of their problem could be solved that way and how much of the analysis coming from Cyc is actually the result of subject matter experts effectively building domain-specific solutions the hard way inside of Cyc. With a lot of Cycorp projects, it’s hard to point your finger at exactly where the “AI” is happening… The degree to which it’s effective seemed to me to be a case-by-case thing. While working there I tended to suspect that Cyc people underestimated the degree to which you could get a large fraction of their results using something like Datomic and it was an open question (to me at least) whether the extra 10% or whatever was worth how much massively more complicated it is to work with Cyc.\nStructurally, the Cycorp had two levels. At the upper level are Lenat, Witbrock, and such keepers of the faith, who kept the ceaseless striving for that elusive dream alive. At the lower level are the working ontological engineers who just had to deliver the product, AGI or not.\nIt turns out there’s a kind of reality distortion field around the management there, despite their best intentions - partially maintained by the management’s own steadfast belief in the idea that what Cyc does is what it ought to be doing, but partially maintained by a layer of people that actively isolate the management from understanding the dirty work that goes into actually making projects work or appear to. So while a certain amount of “common sense” knowledge factors into the reasoning processes, a great amount of Cyc’s output at the project level really comes from hand-crafted algorithms implemented either in the inference engine or the ontology.\nOver the years, the Cyc as its actually implemented has drifted pretty far from the Cyc that people like Doug Lenat believe in, and the degree to which they’re willing or able to acknowledge that seems to sort of drift around, often dependent on factors like mood. Doug would show up and be very confused about why some things were hard because he just believes that Cyc works differently than it does in practice, and people had project deadlines, so they often implemented features via hacks to shape inference or hand-built algorithms to deliver answers that Doug thought ought to be derived from principles via inference. Doug thinks way more stuff that Cyc does is something that it effectively learned to do by automatically deriving a way to solve the general form of a problem, rather than a programmer up late hand-coding things to make a demo work the next day, and the programmers aren’t going to tell him because there’s a demo tomorrow too and it’s not working yet.\nBut that’s enough about unverified rumors, and I apologize. It would have been better for epistemic hygiene if there were more open information about Cycorp. Let’s turn to a Cycoanalysis of Lenat’s rhetorics, which is more well-documented.\nAccording to multiple reports, Lenat was charismatic, able to sell his vision of AGI to many people. Having read most documents produced by Lenat or Cycorp over the 40 years, I have discovered that there is a consistent list of themes that Lenat just kept repeating over his career. Each theme has a double structure: a technical statement that has an emotionally neutral valence, and a moral coloring that provides the call to action, the charisma, the coherence for the employees to align to his vision.\nAnd more than technical, moral, and personal conviction is on the line: If Cyc really would take 1000 person-years (20 years with 50 philosopher PhDs), then it would cost about $100 million just in human labor. The Cycorp, if it were to survive, has a strong commercial interest in rejecting all alternatives. It can be very hard to get someone to understand something, when their product differentiation depends on them not understanding it.\nLenat’s rejections progressed with time as each new challenger arose, applying the same tenets in different decades.\nIn the 1980s, like other expert systems people, he aimed his rejection at the previous logical AI methods exemplified by Simon and Newell. Logical AI was a dream that a graduate student might build an AGI during a thesis period, if only they knew the “Maxwell’s equations of thinking”. Of course, such attempts failed, because there are no such equations. He took a little effort towards rejecting the other logical AI approach exemplified by (Newell and Simon 1972), by constructing models that reproduced every little detail of how humans really perform in psychometric experiments, such as their reaction times, their uhhs and oopses. Admitting its interest to psychologists, he considered it a distraction for machine intelligence.\nIn the 1990s, as the expert system hype died down, he turned his criticism towards expert systems. He recalled that, back when he was young, before academia had rejected him, he thought automated discovery with AI, such as AM and EURISKO, would lead the way to self-improving learning machines. But then he was disabused of this. BACON discovered Kepler’s three laws “only” from data, but that’s because Pat Langley was careful in presenting nothing but the relevant data. The cost to discover Kepler’s laws on the filtered dataset? A few CPU-hours. The cost to filter the dataset? 10 Kepler-years. Similarly, AM started out with the set-theory axioms and discovered prime numbers and some famous conjectures, but quickly ended up enumerating boring complications. Lenat had to keep adding in more heuristics to get something out of it. Similarly, EURISKO would run overnight and Lenat would check its outputs in the morning, remove some bad ideas, add some good ones, and so on. The Traveller 1981 win was “60/40% Lenat/EURISKO” after all.\nGeneralizing, Lenat argued that there is a common thread across all these machine learning systems. They would all start out discovering many interesting basic things, but quickly “run out of steam” enumerating boring complications. Lenat called it as systems putting up a “veneer of intelligence” while they were really just “discharging potential energy that was stored in them”. That is, the creators secretly put into the program with their own expert knowledge somehow, either through the right rules, heuristics, dataset, features, or some other thing. Once the expert knowledge is “exhausted”, no more discoveries could be made, and the veneer wears off. However, it makes for impressive demos, leading to cycles of hype and bust. The only escape is to prime the knowledge pump. If the knowledge base is large enough, then it wouldn’t run out of steam. (D. B. Lenat 2008)\nLenat’s approach was not welcomed by the academics, and the feeling was mutual. AI researchers thought the Cyc project was hyped, and were unhappy with the secretive nature of Cycorp. Philosophers considered the Cyc project premature – how could Lenat build an ontology for the world when philosophers hadn’t even figured out what the ontology is? Lenat shot back, calling academics lazy, abstract, and unable to persist through decades of hard engineering work. (Thompson 2001) Among the academics, the only one that still supported him was Marvin Minsky, who had no problem calling the rest of AI research “brain-dead since the 1970s”, especially robotics: “Graduate students are wasting 3 years of their lives soldering and repairing robots, instead of making them smart.”. (Baard 2003)\nInteresting. Why the hate towards robotics? Well, during the 1990s, there were two main challengers to his idea of a symbolic-logical system. On the one side, there was the challenge of bottom-up non-symbolic reasoning promoted by Rodney Brooks’ subsumption architecture (Brooks 1990), and the statistical machine learning methods like support vector machines. He did not have much to say about the statistical methods – not yet – but he did reject the subsumption architecture as a mistaken attempt to reach AGI through robotics, much as Minsky did. Motors, sensors, etc, are simply not needed – common sense, specified in logical language, is all you need. The hard work needed to get the robots to do anything is, you see, the wrong kind of hard work.\nOn the other side, though most expert system researchers had shrunken their ambition in the winter chill, from AGI down to mere commercial survival, a few still believed in the mission. They thought that by building little systems, brick by brick, we can build towards a generally intelligent system. This is basically a “Society of Mind” approach of Marvin Minsky, and even though Lenat and Minsky liked each other’s research, Lenat rejected this approach as well. One cannot settle for building common sense bit by bit, expecting a finished system to emerge, but must braid the whole thing under one roof, one upper ontology. The ontology does not have to be perfect or efficient, but there has to be one. Without it, the Society of Mind would fragment into a Tower of Babel, with little expert systems of incompatible ontologies, just like how Feigenbaum’s dream of a “Library of Congress” of knowledge bases failed to materialize.\nIn the 2000s, big data arrived with the Internet, and statistical learning became dominant. No doubt trying to preempt customers’ “Why don’t I just Google it?”, he turned his firepower towards statistical learning systems. He never tired of pointing out that, if you make an even slightly complex query like “Is the Space Needle taller than the Eiffel Tower?”, Google will happily serve up results saying “The Space Needle is 605 feet high.” and “The Eiffel Tower is 1,063 feet high.”, unable to actually answer your question. Despite having 15,000 servers, Google only ran dumb statistical algorithms, while Cyc running on a single server could answer it. Google-style statistical machine learning, like its trillion-token statistical machine translations systems (Brants et al. 2007), was just pattern matching, yet another grasping after a free lunch. Such systems could not truly understand. As an alternative, he held out Cyc as the foundation to the Semantic Web, which would build a system that would truly understand.\nCuriously, right from the start, Lenat considered self-organized neural networks as not a viable path towards general intelligence, but for the same reasons as to why the logical AI programs of Simon and Newell would fail! From our perspective, they couldn’t be more different, yet to Lenat, neural nets, General Problem Solvers, n-gram models, whatever, are all just “explicit-knowledge-free systems”, too neat, not scruffy, and would fail for the exact same reason.\nthey are unaesthetic! And they entail person-centuries of hard knowledge-entry work. Until we are forced to them, Occam’s Razor encourages us to try more elegant solutions, such as training a neural net “from scratch”; or getting an infant-simulator and then “talking to it”. Only as these fail do we turn, unhappily, to the “hand-craft a huge KB” tactic.\n…\nOur position regarding the aesthetes: There is a methodological difference between our “scruffy” way of doing AI and the aesthetes’ “neat” way… If only there were a secret ingredient for intelligence–Maxwell’s equations of thought. If only we could axiomatize the world in a small set of axioms, and deduce everything. If only our learning program could start from scratch. If only our neural nets were big or cerebellar or hyperlinear enough. If only the world were like that. But it isn’t. The evidence indicates that almost all the power is in the bulk knowledge. As Whitehead remarked, “God is in the details.”\n(D. B. Lenat and Feigenbaum 1991)\nWith the second neural network winter, he did not pay more attention to them, but as they arose yet again in the 2010s, with some exasperation, he would remind the world that, no, nothing has changed. Neural nets had already failed and they would fail. Thinking that “one large net for everything” would just work is yet another example of the logical AI fallacy that “If only we have the Maxwell’s equations of learning, it will just work!”. They are always “remembering and espousing”, but never “understanding and inferring”, and can only ever be the “right brain” to Cyc’s “left brain” (D. B. Lenat and Marcus 2023). As Deep Learning kept blowing past expectations, he rehashed the same 1980s argument with escalating apocalypse:\nIf computers were human, they’d present themselves as autistic, schizophrenic, or otherwise brittle. It would be unwise or dangerous for that person to take care of children and cook meals, but it’s on the horizon for home robots. That’s like saying, ‘We have an important job to do, but we’re going to hire dogs and cats to do it.’\n(Love 2014)\nNo matter how good your elegant theory of syntax and semantics is, there’s always this annoying residue of pragmatics, which ends up being the lower 99% of the iceberg.  You can wish it weren’t so, and ignore it, which is easy to do because it’s out of sight (it’s not explicitly there in the letters, words, and sentences on the page, it’s lurking in the empty spaces around the letters, words, and sentences.)  But lacking it, to any noticeable degree, gets a person labeled autistic. They may be otherwise quite smart and charming (such as Raymond in Rain Man and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There), but it would be frankly dangerous to let them drive your car, mind your baby, cook your meals, act as your physician, manage your money, etc. And yet those are the very applications the world is blithely handing over to severely autistic AI programs!\n(D. B. Lenat 2017)\nWe would not be comfortable giving a severely neurologically-impaired person – say someone with no functioning left brain hemisphere – real-time decision-making authority over our family members’ health, our life savings, our cars, or our missile defense systems. Yet we are hurtling in that direction with today’s AI’s which are impaired in almost exactly that same fashion! They – those people and those AI programs – have trouble doing multi-step abstract reasoning, and that limitation makes their decision-making and behavior brittle, especially when confronted by unfamiliar, unexpected and unusual situations… Machine learning algorithms have scarcely changed at all, in the last 40 years… Current AI’s can form and recognize patterns, but they don’t really understand anything. That’s what we humans use our left brain hemispheres for.\n… Researchers and application builders tolerate their AI systems having just the thinnest veneer of intelligence, and that may be adequate for fast internet searching or party conversation or New York Times op-ed pieces, but that simple representation leads to inferences and answers which fall far short of the levels of competence and insight and adaptability that expert humans routinely achieve at complicated tasks, and leads to shallow explanations and justifications of those answers. There is a way out of that trap, though it’s not pleasant or elegant or easy. The solution is not a machine-learning-like “free lunch” or one clap-of-thunder insight about a clever algorithm: it requires a lot of hard work…\n(D. B. Lenat 2019a)\nConcurrently, on the Cycorp website, two white papers published in 2021-04 reiterated their product differentiation against the false promises of neural networks and Bayesian networks.20 Neural networks posed a great commercial threat to their business, and the Bayesian networks, by promising to half-open the neural network black box, threatened their business as well. The papers argued that since both were not rule-based logical systems, they were not Actually Intelligent. After such fear-uncertainty-doubt, they reassured the reader that true AI needs both the left brain and the right brain, and they sell the finest left brains on the planet.\n20 Read it yourself (\\(\\sim 3 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{\\mu Lenat}\\)) to see how hard they had to work that product differentiation. Calling it “Actually Intelligent”, claiming “ML can never give an explicit step-by-step explanation of its line of reasoning behind a conclusion, but Cyc always can.”, and insinuating that nobody could do Natural Language Understanding yet because none of those newfangled neural networks had any pragmatics… And this was uploaded in 2021-04, a year after GPT-3! It was written in the same FUDdy voice of those that still sold machine translation services after Google Neural Translate, transcription services after OpenAI Whisper, or copywriting services after ChatGPT.\nThe same accusation of brain-damage that he leveled at neural networks was in fact a rehash of the exact same argument he had made against statistical machine learning systems like Cleverbot, Google, and Amazon recommender systems (Love 2014), since he made no distinction between statistical methods, be it keyword matching, n-gram models, or neural networks. They are all the same veneer of intelligence, same free lunch, same shallowness.\nLenat could apply the same criticisms with the same counterexamples over his 40 years of career, without needing to inspect the details of these machine learning architectures, because he had the following fully general proof, which you can discover by intersecting the previous paragraphs in this section:\nHedgehogs. Hedgehogs are all the same. They have one big idea, one big proof, one big theory, and continue going on with it for decades. Chomsky did it, Minsky did it, and Lenat did it too. Benefit: If they got it right, they really got it right. Cost: If they got it wrong, then they would sound like a broken record.\nFor example, Lenat called expert systems “brittle” and “idiot savants” in the 1990s (D. B. Lenat 1995a), and statistical machine learning systems “brittle” (probably also “idiot savant”) in the 2000s, and neural networks “brittle” and “autistic” since 2015 until his death.21\n21 Some words and phrases reappear so often in Lenat’s writings that I termed them “Lenatisms” (\\(\\sim 10^6 \\mathrm{\\mu Lenat/word}\\)) and came to hate them as much as I hate GPTisms like “delve” and “crucial”: free lunch, hard work, physics envy, Maxwell’s equations, clever algorithm, measles, idiot-savant, autistic, veneer of intelligence, shallow, pattern matching, brittle, understand, trustworthy, left brain, hemisphere.\nSimilarly, he kept talking about the Winograd schema challenge, and how logically encoded common sense is the only way to solve it. He started talking about it in the 1990s (D. B. Lenat 1995b). He was still telling Stephen Wolfram in 2019 that, surely, if Cyc would team up with Wolfram Alpha, then they could finally solve the challenge for good (Wolfram 2023). He was still tweeting about it even on 2020-03-12, about (Sakaguchi et al. 2021) which showed stated that modern LLMs (GPT-2, BERT, and a few others) was underperforming on WinoGrande, a larger version of the previous Winograd benchmark. Etc, etc.\nNot just his arguments were repetitive, but his “war stories” too. In 1994, Cyc could retrieve images by semantic search, so for example, it would retrieve an image of a rock climber if queried “an adventurous man” (D. B. Lenat 1995a). Great demo for 1994, and he would harp on this throughout the 2000s in his presentations, presumably to product-differentiate against Google-like Image Search engines. Similarly, he first recounted in 1987 of an expert system that diagnosed his rusty car with measles (D. B. Lenat and Feigenbaum 1991), then again in (D. B. Lenat 1995a), then again and again throughout his presentations in the 2000s, and he was still telling the story (and about the Winograd schema) in 2019.\nIn his last paper, coauthored with Gary Marcus, he updated his critique of statistical machine learning to the LLM age. Again the shallowness, brittleness, free lunch, etc.\nGiven the arduous nature of the reasoning required… it is understandable almost all AI researchers and developers have gone in the opposite direction, abandoning or trivializing symbolic representation and reasoning, and instead seeking one or another sort of “free lunch” in the form of perceptrons, multi-layer neural networks and, most recently, LLMs… limiting an AI to such a narrow “baby talk” language would be a huge barrier to it ever becoming a trustworthy general AI.\n(D. B. Lenat and Marcus 2023)\nI am struck by the irony that a veteran of logical AI would call neural networks “brittle”, or make an appeal to sunk cost. Lenat had devoted 2000 person-years to the project, therefore a “free lunch” shouldn’t work, nevermind the fact that these “free” lunches took 20 years of gritty battles to build the datasets, struggles with the cussedness of CUDA, waking up to yet another divergent overnight training run, staring at tensors filled with NaNs, and eventually cost $100 million per serving, roughly the total budget of Cycorp through its life. How dare you to go “free lunch” on us… But de mortuis nil nisi bonum.\nLenat died in 2023, unmourned on Lucid AI and Cycorp, who, like ABBYY, still proudly advertise their product differentiation to this day.\nNapoleon died in 1821. Wellington was greatly saddened.\nPlutarch has related that Julius Caesar wept for the death of Pompey; Aurelian did not weep for the death of John, but he felt what a man would feel when rid of an incurable disease that had become a part of his life.\n— Borges, The Theologians\nCome as you are, as you were\nAs I want you to be\nAs a friend, as a friend\nAs an old enemy\nTake your time, hurry up\nChoice is yours, don’t be late\nTake a rest, as a friend\nAs an old memoria…\nYuxi on the Wired\nGive anonymous feedback\nEverything PD; CC0 fallback."}

The Reds are reportedly set to experience a significant overhaul in their attacking options, with potential departures of key forwards such as Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota, and Luis Diaz. This reshuffle opens the door for new talent to step in, and one name that has caught the eye is Jamie Bynoe-Gittens from Borussia Dortmund.\nSky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg recently revealed that 20-year-old Bynoe-Gittens has expressed his desire to leave Dortmund come summer. With his announcement, the English winger has put several clubs on high alert, including Liverpool, who have shown continued interest in him. “Jamie Gittens wants to leave Borussia Dortmund this summer. BVB have been informed of his desire to move and internally expect him to leave. FC Bayern still have Gittens on their list. He also has a market in England, and a return to the Premier League appeals to him,” reported Plettenberg on X.\n\n🚨🆕 Jamie #Gittens wants to leave Borussia Dortmund this summer – @berger_pj. #BVB have been informed of his desire to move and internally expect him to leave.\nFC Bayern still have Gittens on their list. He also has a market in England, and a return to the Premier League… pic.twitter.com/i7YrhS9dqz\n— Florian Plettenberg (@Plettigoal) April 7, 2025\n\nBynoe-Gittens isn’t just another name in the transfer market; his stats speak volumes about his capabilities. With an impressive tally of seven goals and four assists in 20 Bundesliga games this season, he stands out as a direct, pacey winger who thrives in dynamic attacking roles—exactly what Slot looks for in a forward. His ability to perform consistent dribbles (4.3 per 90 minutes) and his knack for getting into the attacking penalty area (5.60 touches per game) highlight his potential to fill the possible void left by Diaz.\nArne Slot’s preference for versatile and dynamic attackers makes Bynoe-Gittens an ideal fit for Liverpool. His youth and agility could complement the playing style that Slot has been cultivating at Anfield, which relies heavily on quick, clinical finishers and dynamic play on the wings. Bynoe-Gittens’ ability to play across the front three adds another layer of strategic flexibility for Liverpool’s tactical setups but it will come at a price with an expected fee of around £70million.\nAs Liverpool fans, the prospect of Jamie Bynoe-Gittens donning the red jersey is an exciting one. His young age coupled with his impressive performance stats from the Bundesliga promises a bright future. The thought of him combining forces with the likes of Mohamed Salah and potentially replacing a stalwart like Luis Diaz is thrilling. His agility and skillset seem tailor-made for Slot’s dynamic and fast-paced attacking ethos. Securing his signature would not only be a statement of intent from Liverpool but also a step towards injecting fresh, young blood into the squad, ensuring the team remains competitive on all fronts. It’s a move that could very well keep us at the pinnacle of English football and continue our European adventures with renewed vigour.\n\nสล็อตเว็บตรง\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nsister casino sites\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2009-2025 AnfieldIndex.com .

A coalition of publishers, including The New York Times and The Guardian, has launched a campaign demanding the US government to hold Big Tech accountable for using creative content to develop artificial intelligence products. Organized by the News/Media Alliance, the \"Support Responsible AI\" campaign accuses tech giants of exploiting copyrighted material without compensating the creators. \nThe campaign's website frames this practice as a direct threat to content creators' livelihoods. Accompanying the initiative are bold red-and-white advertisements featuring slogans like \"Protect Jobs from AI Theft,\" \"AI Steals from You Too,\" and \"Keep Watch on AI.\" The alliance stated that these ads will appear in hundreds of news publications and digital platforms nationwide in the coming days. Other participants in the coilition include The Atlantic, Seattle Times, and Politico owner Axel Springer.\nThe movement presents three demands for policymakers. First, it calls for legislation that requires Big Tech and AI companies to fairly compensate creators when using their work to train their AI systems. Second, it seeks mandatory transparency in the sourcing and attribution of AI-generated content. Lastly, it urges action to prevent monopolistic practices that could stifle competition and coerce smaller players in the industry.\nPresident and CEO of the News/Media Alliance Danielle Coffey emphasized that the news media industry is not opposed to AI technology but advocates for a balanced system that ensures responsible innovation.\n\"We want an ecosystem where AI provides a return to the quality content that fuels its intelligence,\" she said.\n\nThe campaign emerged from the escalating tension between media organizations and AI companies. Recently, OpenAI released an image-generation tool that mimics iconic anime styles, such as those of Studio Ghibli, drawing backlash from artists on social media. Many artists have criticized AI tools for appropriating their work without consent, with some even leaving platforms like X after they discovered that the site had used their posts to train AI models.\nSimilar disputes have arisen in other corners of the internet. For example, last year on BlueSky, users criticized a Hugging Face machine learning librarian for releasing a dataset derived from publicly available BlueSky posts to train AI models.\nThe conflict between major publishers and AI companies is nothing new. In December 2023, The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of using its articles without authorization to train AI models. A federal judge allowed the case to proceed, rejecting OpenAI's attempt to dismiss it.\nThe US campaign is an echo of efforts abroad. In February, several prominent UK newspapers launched an initiative against unauthorized AI training on copyrighted materials. Their \"MAKE IT FAIR\" campaign featured bold front-page statements urging readers to support protections for creative content against unlicensed use by AI systems.\n\nAbout\nEthics Statement\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nManage Ad Consent\n\nTECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers\nTechSpot is a registered trademark and may not be used by third parties without express written permission.\nTechSpot is represented by Future PLC.

Then China stepped in.", "fullContent": "BREAKING: Supreme Court grants Trump request to fire independent agency members\n\nProfile\nSections\nLocal\ntv\nFeatured\nMore From NBC\nFollow NBC News\n news Alerts\nThere are no new alerts at this time\nHONG KONG — A huge deal President Donald Trump touted as a victory in his campaign to “take back” the Panama Canal from China could be on the rocks amid pushback from Beijing. \nThe $23 billion sale involving two ports run by CK Hutchison, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, to a consortium led by the U.S. investment firm BlackRock had been scheduled to be signed last week. \nBut an agreement between the two has been delayed under pressure from China, whose market regulator launched a review of the deal as state-run newspapers attacked it as undermining China’s national interests.\nNBC News takes a look at the sale and what it may mean politically and economically for the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies.\nIn his inaugural speech in January, Trump claimed without providing evidence that China controlled the 50-mile canal and vowed that the United States will take back the waterway, which he said was “vital” to national security. The Panamanian government has administered the U.S.-built canal since the United States relinquished it to the Central American country in 1999. \nTrump did not rule out military action, and he has directed the Defense Department to draw up plans to send more troops to Panama to “reclaim” the canal, through which 40% of U.S. trade passes.\nVisiting Panama on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth repeated Trump’s pledge to “take back the Panama Canal from China’s influence.”\nThe U.S. “will not allow communist China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation or integrity,” he said. \nChina, which says it has never interfered in the operation of the canal, called Hegseth’s remarks “irresponsible.”\n“We advise the U.S. to reflect on its own bullying and plundering of developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Panama, and stop distorting and slandering China,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Panama said in a statement Wednesday.\nPanama also denies Trump’s accusations about the neutrality of the canal, which is enshrined in its constitution. But to relieve the pressure from Washington, in January it launched an audit of CK Hutchison’s Panama Ports Co. (PPC), which since 1997 has operated two ports along the canal, Balboa on the Pacific side and Cristóbal on the Atlantic side.\nOn Monday, Panama’s comptroller general said the audit had found that the contract was overly favorable to Hutchison PPC, costing Panama $1.3 billion in revenue, and that authorities would sue officials involved in its renewal in 2021.\nCK Hutchison’s sale to BlackRock includes a 90% interest in the two Panama Canal ports and an 80% controlling interest in 43 other ports outside Hong Kong and China. When the deal was announced March 4, the companies said definitive documentation for the Panama Canal operations would be signed by April 2.\nTrump quickly declared victory. “To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” he said in an address to Congress last month, citing the proposed deal.\nThe sale of the two Chinese-run ports is about more than just Panama, said Christopher Hernandez-Roy, senior fellow and deputy director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \n“It represents a major victory for the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back China in the Western Hemisphere,” he said, adding that is something China “would not want to happen.”\nThough CK Hutchison, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, Beijing quickly signaled its displeasure with the deal. \nChina “firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries’ legitimate rights and interests,” Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said last week.\nChinese government offices in Hong Kong have reposted articles from pro-Beijing newspapers criticizing the sale as undermining China’s national interest. Beijing’s market regulator has also said the sale is subject to an antitrust review “to protect fair market competition and safeguard public interests.” \nThe original signing date of April 2 came and went last week. \nWhile neither BlackRock nor CK Hutchison has publicly commented on the delay, analysts say that in light of the cumulative 54% tariff the United States imposed on China, the ports could be used as a bargaining chip for China to extract concessions from the United States.\n“What seems more important is China’s effort to gain leverage in negotiations with Trump,” said Angela Zhang, a professor of law at the University of Southern California and author of “Chinese Antitrust Exceptionalism.” \nWhile the deal does not involve Hutchison’s ports in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, CK Hutchison is publicly listed in Hong Kong, which, Zhang said, could mean China “may have jurisdiction,” even if the transaction “itself occurred offshore.” \nThe review by Beijing’s market regulator is an example of China’s asserting its “long-arm jurisdiction over offshore transactions,” she added. \nBlackRock declined a request for comment. CK Hutchison did not respond to a request for comment.\nFor Panama, the deal’s failure “would be seen as snatching defeat from the jaws of victory,” Hernandez-Roy said.\n“There would be tremendous pressure on Panama to cancel the concessions,” he said, referring to the port operation rights that Hutchison PPC won in 1997.\nNevertheless, some analysts say CK Hutchison, which is not financially dependent on the Chinese government, is expected to press ahead with the deal. \nLi, CK Hutchison’s 96-year-old owner, has been known to draw Beijing’s ire.\n“Beijing is a bit skeptical about Li’s family. But the family still remains to be one of the most influential, if not the most influential, conglomerates in Hong Kong,” said Wilson Chan, co-founder and director of policy research at Hong Kong’s Pagoda Institute.\n“I think what they are actually doing is to diversify the risk, as Trump is getting more and more high-profile about the ports in Panama,” he said. “And during turmoil in the global economy, cash is king.”\nMithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"}

No more. Traffic is much more difficult to predict due to new search-result features and dynamic AI overviews.\nMoreover, the impact of keywords is less predictable as people use voice search and generative AI.\nHence many professional search optimizers claim keyword research is meaningless.\nThat is wrong.\nThe benefits of keyword research are greater than organic search rankings. It reveals where prospects are in the shopping journey and what they know about a topic.\nFor example:\nIn both scenarios, knowing those keywords helps target would-be buyers and create relevant content. The former — consumers new to the journey — likely benefit from definitions and explanatory guides.\nThe latter — folks using industry terms — require actionable content such as features or assembly instructions. Definitions would only distract them and may constitute filler (unhelpful) content by Google’s algorithm.\nFor example, a guide for increasing web traffic would likely include these keywords:\nWe could conclude:\nWe could now group similar keywords based on intent and formulate content accordingly. We could decide, for example, to focus on beginners or pros based on our target prospects.\nWe could then query AI for topic ideas. I did that by prompting Gemini with the above keywords. Here’s the output.\nGemini’s analysis was helpful, but not its “how to increase SEO” suggestion. ChatGPT was different.\nAll three analyses — mine, Gemini, ChatGPT — contribute useful info, but humans must ultimately decide based on their expertise and experience.\nThere’s no need to create separate pages for each keyword. Instead, group keywords based on:\nIn short, keyword analysis helps create better content, much more than rankings alone.\nShare this article:\nCopyright © 2005 - 2025.
