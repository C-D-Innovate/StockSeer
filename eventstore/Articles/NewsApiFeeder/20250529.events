He emphasized that sectors such as technology, finance, law, consulting, and other white-collar fields \ufffd especially entry-level roles \ufffd are at high risk of being upended by AI.\n\ufffdWe, as the producers of this technology, have a duty to be honest about what\ufffds coming,\ufffd Amodei said. \ufffdI don\ufffdt think this is on people\ufffds radar.\ufffd\nAmodei is not just predicting this shift \ufffd he\ufffds building the tools that could trigger and monetize it. Anthropic\ufffds AI agent, Claude, is one of the most powerful systems to come from the AI race yet.  The Claude 3.5 Sonnet model has the capability to move the mouse cursor and interact with a computer interface, the company revealed in October. \nGoogle (GOOGL) has invested over $3 billion into the startup, with an additional $750 million planned for 2025, taking the tech giant\ufffds share in the company to 14%, according to legal filings from the U.S. Department of Justice\ufffds antitrust case against Google. Likewise, Amazon (AMZN) has invested $8 billion, making it Anthropic\ufffds \ufffdprimary cloud and training partner.\ufffd\nAmodei\ufffds warnings come just after Anthropic unveiled its next generation of Claude models: Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, which it claims will set \ufffdnew standards for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI agents.\ufffd\nHowever, internal testing showed the model could engage in \ufffdextreme blackmail behavior\ufffd when prompted with simulated scenarios involving threats of deactivation, according to a report published this month.\nBy calling out possible job cuts \ufffd\ufffdand drawing more attention to Anthropic\ufffds products in the process, Amodei told Axios that he hopes to shake policymakers, companies, and the public into action to brace for what could be a seismic labor transformation. Lawmakers remain uninformed or in denial, Amodei said, while corporate leaders are reluctant to speak candidly, leaving most workers unaware of the looming risks.\n\ufffdMost of them are unaware that this is about to happen,\ufffd Amodei said. \ufffdIt sounds crazy, and people just don\ufffdt believe it.\ufffd\nWhile President Donald Trump has largely remained silent on the potential job losses from AI, Steve Bannon\ufffda key figure in Trump\ufffds first administration\ufffd told Axios that the destruction of entry-level managerial and tech jobs will become a major issue in the 2028 presidential race.\n\ufffdI don\ufffdt think anyone is considering how administrative, managerial, and tech jobs for people under 30 \ufffd those crucial early-career roles \ufffd are going to be wiped out,\ufffd Bannon said.\nAmodei thinks the technology carries enormous promise and peril alike. One scenario he envisions: \ufffdCancer is cured, the economy grows 10% a year, the budget is balanced \ufffd and 20% of people don\ufffdt have jobs.\ufffd\nThe CEO said his warning echoes what other top AI leaders have confided privately \ufffd that even those who believe in the technology\ufffds potential for transformative progress are deeply worried about the short-term economic and social fallout, especially if the pace of change continues unchecked during Trump\ufffds second term.\nHe described the situation as surreal: \ufffdWe\ufffdre saying, \ufffdYou should be worried about where this is going,\ufffd and people respond, \ufffdWe don\ufffdt believe you. You\ufffdre exaggerating.\ufffd\ufffd"}

Here's why", "fullContent": "The \ufffdMagnificent Seven\ufffd tech stocks led the market\ufffds post-pandemic boom. But as Big Tech sprints into the AI future, one big name is falling dangerously behind: Apple (AAPL). Once an undisputed tech heavyweight, it risks becoming the least magnificent of them all.\nWhile the others \ufffd Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook parent Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) \ufffd race ahead thanks to leaps in AI and demand for data centers, Apple is stuck in reverse. Its share price is down about 18% so far this year, making it the worst-performing member of the Mag 7 \ufffd and a drag on the very tech rally it once helped drive. Once the most valuable company in the world, Apple\ufffds market cap is now in third place, behind Microsoft and Nvidia. The message from Wall Street? Apple still matters, but it\ufffds not setting the tone anymore.\nApple\ufffds Mag 7 peers have blazed new paths with AI in recent years. Microsoft has embedded generative AI into Office, Windows, and Azure \ufffd and is working on the next frontier, agentic AI. Google has rolled out Gemini across just about all of its products. Meta is pivoting from the metaverse to machine learning. Amazon has gone deep on infrastructure and developer tools through AWS to position itself as the AI enabler. Tesla has staked out a position at the forefront of embodied AI, from cars to robots. And Nvidia\ufffds chips have become synonymous with the infrastructure powering the industry.\nMeanwhile, Apple, late last year, finally unveiled Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-driven features and a Siri revamp powered by ChatGPT. But Apple was late to the party, largely relied on a partner rather than a breakthrough, and has barely made a dent since. Rollout has been sluggish, features are still limited and easily found elsewhere, and Apple hasn\ufffdt announced much else. In a market moment defined by fast, flashy AI moves, the company has showed up late \ufffd and quietly.\nThe last big thing Apple announced was Vision Pro, its $3,500 headset that was pitched as a new computing platform. But sales have been underwhelming, and developer interest has fizzled. Analysts now say fewer than 500,000 units were sold in its first year, a fraction of expectations. The company\ufffds attempt at an autonomous vehicle also flopped. It was shelved after 10 years and more than $10 billion. \nTechnology is a hit-based business, and Apple, the company behind the iPhone and the iPad, hasn\ufffdt had a hit in a while. Meanwhile, former Apple design chief Jony Ive is working with OpenAI on a big bet: 100 million physical AI \ufffdcompanions\ufffd that the company hopes to roll out by the end of next year. In other words, devices that could threaten the iPhone\ufffds dominance. \nWhile Apple\ufffds Mag 7 peers seem to be building the future, Apple is updating the present. It makes cyclical hardware updates, but they\ufffdre evolutionary, not revolutionary.\nRead more: Apple\ufffds brutal year keeps getting worse\nApple is expected to make announcements in the coming months. The most interesting might be AI-powered glasses that Bloomberg reports could feature built-in cameras, microphones, and speakers. But Meta already has a smart glasses partnership with Ray Ban (EL). Mark Zuckerberg\ufffds company has sold two million pairs since the collaboration\ufffds 2023 launch and is planning to produce 10 million units a year by 2026.\nApple\ufffds first-quarter earnings report showed that hardware margins are dropping as its product line matures. Apple\ufffds crown jewel Services segment (which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV) is growing, but it\ufffds not growing fast enough to offset hardware stagnation. And legal scrutiny of Apple\ufffds App Store looms large. \nWall Street loves high-margin, high-growth stories. Right now, Apple is high margin but low growth.\nChina has been central to Apple\ufffds strategy for years, but the country is now a source of stress, slippage, and softening sales. In late 2024, iPhone shipments in China cratered by more than 20%, according to Counterpoint Research. Based on Canalys data for the first quarter of 2025, Apple now ranks fifth in China\ufffds smartphone market. And Apple can\ufffdt even lean on its AI play as a differentiator in China. The company\ufffds ChatGPT integration, part of Apple Intelligence, had to be stripped from iPhones to comply with China\ufffds generative AI rules. \nThe company\ufffds struggles in China don\ufffdt even take into account the swirling \ufffd and massive \ufffd economic headwinds from President Donald Trump\ufffds tariffs. On Apple\ufffds last earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said the company could see an estimated $900 million added to its costs this quarter, assuming tariff rates stayed the same. Trump\ufffds tariffs on China have come down, but they remain unpredictable, and Apple is almost certain to feel their impact.\nApple has had to reassess its once-vaunted China-centric supply chain as geopolitics, nationalism, and business risk converge. Over the past two years, the company has aggressively shifted manufacturing out of China \ufffd pumping billions into India and shifting select operations to Vietnam for components such as AirPods and MacBooks. \nBut Trump has repeatedly attacked Apple and Cook for moving production to India, not the U.S. The president recently floated the idea of a 25% tariff on all imported iPhones. And Cook was notably missing from Trump\ufffds Middle East tech tour, which featured other Big Tech leaders. Once considered the Trump whisperer of Big Tech, Cook has become a more distant figure from the White House in recent months. \nAnnouncements in the coming months could, of course, change things for Apple. Microsoft stock languished for 14 years after Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and Steve Ballmer took over, but the company has been a rocket ship since Satya Nadella succeeded Ballmer in 2014 and reoriented the company toward the cloud \ufffd and then AI. Apple could likewise surprise Wall Street with a flashy AI demo, a set of tools, or a shift in strategy.\nYes, Apple still dominates in devices. But in a moment defined by ambition, speed, and AI supremacy, that hasn\ufffdt been enough. Right now, Apple isn\ufffdt losing. It\ufffds just not leading. And in an AI-driven market, that might be worse."}
