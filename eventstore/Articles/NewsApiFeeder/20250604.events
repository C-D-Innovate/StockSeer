It cited increased demand for compute power due to generative AI.\nIn the past 15 years, the retail behemoth has injected $12 billion into the state, where it has 13 fulfillment centers, as well as wind and solar farms. The company says this expansion will create 500 new high-skilled jobs. \nGovernor Josh Stein voiced his enthusiasm in a press release, noting that \ufffdAmazon\ufffds investment is among the largest in state history.\ufffd The company is also creating training programs for data center technicians and $150,000 in grants for STEM education.\nThe data centers will be located in Richmond Country, which includes the city of Rockingham, which is 70 miles southeast of Charlotte, along the border with South Carolina. It\ufffds 100 miles south of Raleigh, a major tech hub in the region.\nIn March, Amazon broke ground on a robotics fulfillment center in Wilmington, North Carolina, a four-and-a-half-story building with more than 3 million square feet of floor space. Although it will be focused on automation, the company promised it would create more than 1,000 full- and part-time jobs. It\ufffds expected to open in 2026.\nIn February, 75% of workers at an Amazon fulfillment center in Garner, a suburb of Raleigh, rejected a proposal to unionize by a group called CAUSE: Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment. The group\ufffds spokesperson, Rev. Ryan Brown, told CBS News (PARA): \ufffdWe knew that historically the tide was against us to have a win for several reasons. One, we\ufffdre in the South. Two, the average worker that\ufffds in North Carolina knows nothing about a union and the benefits of a union and what a union could do for them.\ufffd"}

Not to mention water.\nThe Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a public health alert for Organic Rancher ground beef with best-before dates of June 19-20, marked \ufffdEST.4027.\ufffd Technically it\ufffds not a recall\ufffdbecause the product is no longer on shelves, but it was distributed to Whole Foods (AMZN) stores across the country. The beef may be contaminated with E.coli, and FSIS advised anyone who still has it in their fridge or freezer to discard it.\nMeanwhile, a voluntary recall for tomatoes from Williams Farms of Georgia and the Carolinas that was issued in early May due to salmonella now has been upgraded to a Class 1 recall, meaning the product could \ufffdcause serious adverse health consequences or death.\ufffd The tomatoes were distributed the week of April 23.\nIf you bought Topo Chico (KO) Mineral Waters from a Costco store in Texas or Louisiana the week of May 20, in 18-packs of 16.9-ounce bottles, they might be infected with pseudomonas, a bacteria that\ufffds found naturally in water sources and is unlikely to cause harm to anyone with a healthy immune systems. But customers are nonetheless urged to return the bottles for a full refund or exchange. \nFSIS reports this week that more than 6,000 lb. of pork lard and beef tallow products from Sulu Organics of Illinois \ufffdwere produced without the benefit of federal inspection.\ufffd\nFinally, Amneal Pharmaceuticals (AMRX) issued a nationwide recall this week for sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim tablets, used for urinary tract infections, due to microbial contamination that could result in serious and life-threatening conditions. The tablets were sold between December 4 and May 15.\nIn February, FSIS said that despite hiring freezes in most federal departments, its frontline inspection roles are considered public safety positions and would not be affected by layoffs. In March, Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cut 3,500 positions at the FDA."}

Outside of CFO and accounting circles, almost no one knew it existed. \ufffdI work on these tax write-offs and still hadn\ufffdt heard about this,\ufffd a chief operating officer at a private-equity-backed tech company told Quartz. \ufffdIt\ufffds just been so weirdly silent.\ufffd\nStill, the delayed change to a decades-old tax provision \ufffd buried deep in the 2017 tax law \ufffd has contributed to the loss of hundreds of thousands of high-paying, white-collar jobs. That\ufffds the picture that emerges from a review of corporate filings, public financial data, analysis of timelines, and interviews with industry insiders. One accountant, working in-house at a tech company, described it as a \ufffdniche issue with broad impact,\ufffd echoing sentiments from venture capital investors also interviewed for this article. Some spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive political matters.\nSince the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off, according to industry tallies. Headlines have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic and, more recently, AI. But beneath the surface was a hidden accelerant: a change to what\ufffds known as Section 174 that helped gut in-house software and product development teams everywhere from tech giants such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) to much smaller, private, direct-to-consumer and other internet-first companies.\nNow, as a bipartisan effort to repeal the Section 174 change moves through Congress, bigger questions are surfacing: How did a single line in the tax code help trigger a tsunami of mass layoffs? And why did no one see it coming? \nFor almost 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of qualified research and development spending in the year they incurred the costs. Salaries, software, contractor payments \ufffd if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it came off the top of a firm\ufffds taxable income.\nThe deduction was guaranteed by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S.\nMicrosoft was founded in 1975. Apple (AAPL) launched its first computer in 1976. Google (GOOGL) incorporated in 1998. Facebook opened to the general public in 2006. All these companies, now among the most valuable in the world, developed their earliest products \ufffd programming tools, hardware, search engines \ufffd under a tax system that rewarded building now, not later.\nThe subsequent rise of smartphones, cloud computing, and mobile apps also happened in an America where companies could immediately write off their investments in engineering, infrastructure, and experimentation. It was a baseline assumption \ufffd innovation and risk-taking subsidized by the tax code \ufffd that shaped how founders operated and how investors made decisions.\nIn turn, tech companies largely built their products in the U.S. \nMicrosoft\ufffds operating systems were coded in Washington state. Apple\ufffds early hardware and software teams were in California. Google\ufffds search engine was born at Stanford and scaled from Mountain View. Facebook\ufffds entire social architecture was developed in Menlo Park. The deduction directly incentivized keeping R&D close to home, rewarding companies for investing in American workers, engineers, and infrastructure.\nThat\ufffds what makes the politics of Section 174 so revealing. For all the rhetoric about bringing jobs back and making things in America, the first Trump administration\ufffds major tax bill arguably helped accomplish the opposite.\nWhen Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump\ufffds first term, it slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% \ufffd a massive revenue loss on paper for the federal government.\nTo make the 2017 bill comply with Senate budget rules, lawmakers needed to offset the cost. So they added future tax hikes that wouldn\ufffdt kick in right away, wouldn\ufffdt provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later.\nThe delayed change to Section 174 \ufffd from immediate expensing of R&D to mandatory amortization, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods \ufffd was that kind of provision. It didn\ufffdt start affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear \ufffddeficit neutral\ufffd over the 10-year window used for legislative scoring.\nThe delay wasn\ufffdt a technical necessity. It was a political tactic. Such moves are common in tax legislation. Phase-ins and delayed provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \ufffd Congress\ufffd nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits \ufffd scores legislation, pushing costs or revenue losses outside official forecasting windows.\nAnd so, on schedule in 2022, the change to Section 174 went into effect. Companies filed their 2022 tax returns under the new rules in early 2023. And suddenly, R&D wasn\ufffdt a full, immediate write-off anymore. The tax benefits of salaries for engineers, product and project managers, data scientists, and even some user experience and marketing staff \ufffd all of which had previously reduced taxable income in year one \ufffd now had to be spread out over five- or 15-year periods. \nTo understand the impact, imagine a personal tax code change that allowed you to deduct 100% of your biggest source of expenses, and that becoming a 20% deduction. For cash-strapped companies, especially those not yet profitable, the result was a painful tax bill just as venture funding dried up and interest rates soared.\nIt\ufffds no coincidence that Meta announced its \ufffdYear of Efficiency\ufffd immediately after the Section 174 change took effect. Ditto Microsoft laying off 10,000 employees in January 2023 despite strong earnings, or Google parent Alphabet cutting 12,000 jobs around the same time.\nAmazon (AMZN) also laid off almost 30,000 people, with cuts focused not just on logistics but on Alexa and internal cloud tools \ufffd precisely the kinds of projects that would have once qualified as immediately deductible R&D. Salesforce (CRM) eliminated 10% of its staff, or 8,000 people, including entire product teams.\nIn public, companies blamed bloat and AI. But inside boardrooms, spreadsheets were telling a quieter story. And MD&A notes \ufffd management\ufffds notes on the numbers \ufffd buried deep in 10-K filings recorded the change, too. R&D had become more expensive to carry. Headcount, the leading R&D expense across the tech industry, was the easiest thing to cut.\nIn its 2023 annual report, Meta described salaries as its single biggest R&D expense. Between the first and second years that the Section 174 change began affecting tax returns, Meta cut its total workforce by almost 25%. Over the same period, Microsoft reduced its global headcount by about 7%, with cuts concentrated in product-facing, engineering-heavy roles.\nSmaller companies without the fortress-like balance sheets of Big Tech have arguably been hit even harder. Twilio (TWLO) slashed 22% of its workforce in 2023 alone. Shopify (SHOP) (headquartered in Canada but with much of its R&D teams in the U.S.) cut almost 30% of staff in 2022 and 2023. Coinbase (COIN) reduced headcount by 36% across a pair of brutal restructuring waves.\nSince going into effect, the provision has hit at the very heart of America\ufffds economic growth engine: the tech sector.\nBy market cap, tech giants dominate the S&P 500, with the \ufffdMagnificent 7\ufffd alone accounting for more than a third of the index\ufffds total value. Workforce numbers tell a similar story, with tech employing millions of Americans directly and supporting the employment of tens of millions more. As measured by GDP, capital-T tech contributes about 10% of national output.\nIt\ufffds not just that tech layoffs were large, it\ufffds that they were massively disproportionate. Across the broader U.S. economy, job cuts hovered around in low single digits across most sectors. But in tech, entire divisions vanished, with a whopping 60% jump in layoffs between 2022 and 2023. Some cuts reflected real inefficiencies \ufffd a response to over-hiring during the zero-interest rate boom. At the same time, many of the roles eliminated were in R&D, product, and engineering, precisely the kind of functions that had once benefitted from generous tax treatment under Section 174.\nThroughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms \ufffd basically every company you recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads \ufffd built their growth models around a kind of engineered break-even.\nThe tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not quite the same thing under what\ufffds known as GAAP accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS.\nBut the Section 174 change broke that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, the tax shield vanished. Companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains.\nThe logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first growth collapsed overnight.\nSo it wasn\ufffdt just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave like tech companies. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside the capital-T tech sector. This lines up with OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones.\nAnd American companies ran with that logic. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP.\nAdd that to core tech\ufffds contribution, and the Section 174 shift has likely touched at least 20% of the U.S. economy.\nThe result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue effectively hid a time bomb inside the growth engines of thousands of companies. And when it detonated, it kneecapped the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products.\nIt made building tech companies in America look irrational on a spreadsheet.\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to repeal the Section 174 change, with business groups, CFOs, crypto executives, and venture capitalists lobbying hard for retroactive relief. But the politics are messy. Fixing 174 would mean handing a tax break to the same companies many voters in both parties see as symbols of corporate excess. Any repeal would also come too late for the hundreds of thousands of workers already laid off.\nAnd of course, the losses don\ufffdt stop at Meta\ufffds or Google\ufffds campus gates. They ripple out. When high-paid tech workers disappear, so do the lunch orders. The house tours. The contract gigs. The spending habits that sustain entire urban economies and thousands of other jobs. Sandwich artists. Rideshare drivers. Realtors. Personal trainers. House cleaners. In tech-heavy cities, the fallout runs deep \ufffd and it\ufffds still unfolding.\nWashington is now poised to pass a second Trump tax bill \ufffd one packed with more obscure provisions, more delayed impacts, more quiet redistribution. And it comes as analysts are only just beginning to understand the real-world effects of the last round.\nThe Section 174 change \ufffdsignificantly increased the tax burden on companies investing in innovation, potentially stifling economic growth and reducing the United States\ufffd competitiveness on the global stage,\ufffd according to the tax consulting firm KBKG. \nWhether the U.S. will reverse course \ufffd or simply adapt to a new normal \ufffd remains to be seen."}
