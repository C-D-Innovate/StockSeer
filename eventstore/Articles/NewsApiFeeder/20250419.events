On Earth, these chemicals are made only by certain microbes and algae, although, in theory, non-biological processes could make them, too.\n\nThis isn't the first time JWST has studied this planet. Astronomers from the same team first trained the telescope on K2-18b because it orbits its star in the \"habitable zone,\" the distance from its star where liquid water could exist on the planet's surface. K2-18b is thought to be a \"Hycean\" world with a water ocean and an atmosphere teeming with hydrogen.\n\nIn 2023, the team found methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere of K2-18b . These two chemicals can be produced by life but also by other processes. They also found hints of DMS and DMDS in the planet's atmosphere at that time, but they didn't have enough statistical certainty to be sure. So this time, they used a different instrument on JWST, called the Mid-Infrared Instrument, and detected a spike that could only be explained by these two chemicals.\n\n\"This is an independent line of evidence, using a different instrument than we did before and a different wavelength range of light, where there is no overlap with the previous observations,\" study co-author Nikku Madhusudhan , a professor of astrophysics at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement. \"The signal came through strong and clear.\"\n\nIt's not quite proof of extraterrestrials — yet. The scientists showed the presence of DMS and DMDS with a statistical certainty of three sigma, meaning there's a 0.3% chance it's a statistical fluke. More measurements will be needed to reach five sigma, or less than a 0.00006% probability of occurring by chance. That's the threshold typically used to confirm astronomical discoveries. They don't have it yet, but that data could come soon, the researchers said.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

But in a study published Thursday (April 17), researchers took a second look at one of these seemingly \"vestigial\" organs , called the rete ovarii (RO), and found it may play an unsung role in female fertility. The study was conducted in mice. However, the organ is found across mammals, so the researchers have reason to believe the results apply to humans.\n\nThe not-so-useless horseshoe-shaped structure is a bundle of small tubes that sits under the ovaries. In the new study, the researchers identified three distinct regions within the appendage and found that the structure may have receptors that bind sex hormones.\n\n\"There's still so much we can't even begin to comprehend about female anatomy,\" study lead author Dilara Anbarci, a developmental biologist at the University of Michigan, told Science News. \"I hope this encourages more investigation in reevaluating what we don't already know about the ovary.\"\n\nDiscover more health news\n\n— 'Flesh-eating' vulva infections reported in three cases — gynecologists should know the signs, experts warn\n\n— Ozempic in a pill?

It was an environmental catastrophe: The lake, once the world's fourth largest, was hit by such a severe drought that much of it evaporated, and eventually, the shrinking lake split in two.\n\nResearch published this month quantified the effects of this \"quiet Chernobyl\" disaster and found that it eliminated 1.1 billion tons (1 billion metric tons) of water — enough that the Earth beneath it rebounded \"like a compressed spring that has been released,\" Simon Lamb , an associate professor of Earth science at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, wrote in an article published alongside the study in the journal Nature Geoscience.\n\nThe effects of that rebound are still being felt today as the earth around the lake continues to recoil, the researchers found.\n\nDiscover more planet Earth news\n\n— An ocean of magma formed early in Earth's history, and it may still influence our planet today, study finds\n\n— Why is this desert turning green?

During periods of solar minimum — when its activity is lowest — all is relatively calm on the surface of our home star. Then, solar activity ramps up, and the sun spits out fiery blobs of plasma and solar wind as it ramps up to solar maximum .\n\nWe have just entered a new phase of solar maximum. But the intensity of this solar maximum has led some researchers to propose that another, 100-year cycle may also be affecting the sun's activity. This lesser-known cycle, called the Centennial Gleissberg Cycle (CGC), modulates the intensity of sunspot cycles every 80 to 100 years.\n\nIt's not clear why the CGC happens, but it may be due to a \"subtle sloshing\" of the sun's magnetic fields that, in turn, affects another sun cycle, Scott McIntosh , a solar physicist at the newly formed space weather solutions company Lynker Space who was not involved in the research, told Live Science.\n\nIf that's the case, then we could be in for much more vibrant auroras for decades to come — and our space communications could be in more peril than we suspected. But not everyone agrees that the CGC is turning over. McIntosh said it's too early to make that conclusion, and other experts are skeptical, as well.\n\nSomething for the weekend\n\nSomething for the weekend\n\nIf you're looking for something a little longer to read over the weekend, here are some of the best long reads, book excerpts and interviews published this week.\n\n— Two planets will form a 'smiley face' with the moon on April 25.

The psychiatrist's stuffy, elitist sensibility is oddly part of his allure, and indulging in life's fineries has been an essential part of the character's story thus far. As showrunner Christopher Lloyd said in an oral history of the show via Vanity Fair, \"The vanity and self-importance always helped us lead Frasier into comic situations ... It's not funny to see a guy step into a manhole and get hurt. But if he somehow has done something preposterous to bring that pain upon himself, then you feel freer to laugh.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrequently, that vanity has come from Frasier placing far too much importance on keeping up the appearance of being an urbane member of the upper crust with a refined taste that his colleagues at Seattle's KACL radio station simply can't match. Nowhere is this more evident than in Dr. Crane's apartment, which was always the perfect embodiment of the character's hifalutin sensibility and the way in which that sensibility is frequently punctured by some force outside of Frasier's control. The rhythm of his tastefully decorated living room, for example, is interrupted by Martin's fraying recliner, which is very much the \"manhole\" of the set.\n\nIn order for Martin's recliner to have the desired effect of puncturing Frasier's carefully designed home, that home had to really reflect its owner's pretentiousness. As such, the doctor's Elliott Bay Towers apartment was a luxurious space that even a radio personality of Frasier's standing would surely struggle to afford. As GQ's Gabriella Paiella asked in her 2021 piece chronicling her \"Frasier\" rewatch, \"How the hell did Frasier afford his apartment?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, Paiella actually did her best to answer that question, embarking on a quest to get as close as possible to an actual dollar amount for Frasier's luxury condo. According to executive vice president of Christie's International Real Estate Seattle, Scott Wasner, the apartment itself would have gone for roughly $1 million back in 1993 (the year \"Frasier\" debuted) and would be worth about $5 million today. That was somewhat backed up by a 2018 Curbed article, which asked local Seattle real estate brokers to estimate the cost of Frasier's Elliot Bay Towers escape, with most claiming it would be worth between $3.5 and $3.99 million as of 2018.\n\nAccording to former \"Frasier\" writer Joe Keenan, the writers actually did discuss how the doctor could afford such a place, explaining to Paiella that \"Frasier has an investment income. He made a fair amount of money in Boston as a private therapist and he lectured and he wrote articles and he just invested very well.\" That's that, then. But what about the swanky decor?"}

According to HardwareLuxx, Synology is on a rough course with generations-old sub-par NAS hardware and now appears to be locking its NAS units to its own branded hard drives in its upcoming 2025 Plus models. This is a shame since a few years ago, Synology had neat hardware.\n\nSynology Lost the Plot with Hard Drive Locking Move\n\nIn 2021, we covered how Synology launched an Enterprise Hard Drive Line and started locking Drives for New NASes. That was in a higher-end segment. Realistically, it became hard to recommend that type of solution. QNAP and iXsystems (TrueNAS) pushed ahead with ZFS support and better hardware, but it did not impact the majority of users.\n\nTranslating a relevant bit for our readers.\n\n“…since an estimated hard drive health report is essential for both private and professional use, this creates a compulsion to use Synology’s own or equivalent drives. Additionally, certain features such as volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic firmware updates for third-party devices will be disabled. There are also restrictions on the creation of storage pools, as well as, of course, support in the event of failures, which are not further specified.” (Source: Translated from HardwareLuxx)\n\nChanging this to require Synology branded drives in the “Plus” line is silly. There are only a handful of hard drive manufacturers, and Synology does not have anywhere near the scale to compete at hard drive manufacturing. Consolidation in the hard drive industry was driven by huge economies of scale benefits. Without scale, and a library of patents, it is a very hard market to enter. As a result, Synology must be simply re-branding drives. Labeling drives as a “Dell”, “NetApp”, “HPE”, or other big vendor drive has been going on for years (decades?) on both the hard drive and SSD sides of storage. Realistically, there is usually very little that gets changed in vendor firmware from the drive manufacturer firmware. When we see some changes, it is usually in conjunction with a branded storage controller that also has corresponding firmware changes. Firmware tweaks very rarely target the built-in PCH or SoC SATA controllers on Intel, AMD, and Arm platforms in the mainstream server and storage market.\n\nLet us just call this what it is. It is a grab for extra margin dollars. The challenge is that it is bad for Synology’s customers. For example, the Synology Plus series only scales to 16TB currently with the HAT3310-16T. Synology’s enterprise series scales to 20TB. WD Red Pro drives are already pushing 26TB. Or in other words, in an 8-bay desktop NAS segment to use Synology’s branded drives with Synology’s full feature set has a maximum raw capacity of 128TB. For a QNAP or TrueNAS 8-bay, that is 208TB of raw capacity.\n\nWe just looked at the drives on Amazon, to see when they would be available and their pricing.\n\nSynology’s HAT3310-16T has an estimated delivery date of May 6 to May 28. (Amazon Affiliate link)\n\nWD Red Pro 16TB has an estimated delivery date of April 25 to April 29 (Amazon Affiliate link) while being $10 less expensive\n\nToshiba N300 Pro 16TB has an estimated delivery date of May 4 to May 9 (Amazon Affiliate link) while being $11 less expensive\n\nToshiba N300 16TB (CMR) is showing overnight availability so April 19 (Amazon Affiliate Link) and is $35 less expensive\n\nSeagate IronWolf Pro 16TB is showing same day availability so April 18 (Amazon Affiliate link) but is $10 more expensive\n\nWhen a drive fails, one of the key factors in data security is how fast an array can be rebuilt into a healthy status. Of course, Amazon is just one vendor, but they have the distribution to do same-day and early morning overnight parts to a large portion of the US. Even overnighting a drive that arrives by noon from another vendor would be slower to arrive than two of the four other options at Amazon.\n\nFor Synology customers, the challenge of being vendor-locked into using Synology branded drives is not just about alleged firmware improvements. It is also about being able to keep data secure while finding easy replacements. A NAS in 2025 needs to work with any NAS rated hard drive because frankly there are not that many vendors out there. If a particular model was found to have a very high year 2 failure rate, you would naturally want to start replacing drives with a different model. Vendor locking features to specific Synology drives prevents this, but it also allows Synology to use different vendors behind the label without telling its customers.\n\nAdditionally, there can also be concerns about drive availability in the long-term. If your NAS is vendor-locked to only use Synology drives, then as owner of that NAS you are fully dependent upon Synology’s survival as a company and that they would continue manufacturing drives in the capacity points that you want. Sure, they make 2TB and 4TB model Synology drives today, but what about four years from now when you need a replacement drive? What if Synology sells or merges with some other technology vendor, or goes out of business? This move creates concerns within the Synology ecosystem that did not exist before, and that is not good for customers.\n\nFinal Words\n\nMany will notice that Synology devices have been largely absent from STH even though Synology is a very popular NAS solution. That is not by chance. While I actually like the company’s software, Synology’s NAS hardware feels extremely dated to the point that it feels like most of the solutions are running generations old hardware. The combination of neglecting hardware refresh cycles and now vendor locking features to only using Synology drives will ultimately hurt users. I cannot imagine recommending a NAS solution where I could not get a replacement drive in under 24 hours, if at all, and that makes Synology extremely hard to recommend in 2025.

DMR radios are easily available on the market and the costs are low compared to D-Star or YSF radios, although the complexity of usage creates a barrier for entry. In addition, there is a very large community of listener-only amateurs who are interested in receiving digital transmissions using this mode.\n\nA very basic DMR modem (receiver and transmitter), capable of voice calls, that could emulate a subscriber radio using a SDR transceiver as the radio interface is described in this page.\n\nWhile this modem is just a proof-of-concept interpretation of the DMR standard with no real use-case, there exists at least one open source project which proposes to create an open source DMR transceiver.\n\nThe OpenRTX project is \"a free and open source firmware for digital ham radios designed with a top-down approach with the objectives of modularity, flexibility and high performance\", which aims to create a fully open source radio for amateur radio usage in real life applications. Currently OpenRTX supports the M17 digital mode, but DMR capability seems to be on its roadmap as well. This particular modem could be a source of inspiration, but would require a complete rewrite to work on top of OpenRTX and a real DMR radio, due to various technical limitations (computing power and memory constraints for example).\n\nIn previous articles, a SDR device-based implementation of a DMR repeater (BS in ETSI terminology) was discussed (including multi-carrier and Tier III), using GNU Radio for the lower physical layer and MMDVM-SDR / MMDVMHost-SDR ( slightly modified forks of Jonathan Naylor's MMDVM and MMDVMHost) for the actual DMR repeater functionality. This page is instead related to subscriber radio (MS in ETSI terminology) functionality only.\n\nThe base components which were used for the proof-of-concept DMR modem are GNU Radio for the physical layer, code from MMDVMHost for the data link layer and partly call control layer, and Codec2 as the vocoder for the audio payload. The modem needs to achieve at least voice calls, but future development in line with ETSI standards should include confirmed and unconfirmed data messages, tier III functionality (for trunked radio support), IPv4 transport and other features of the standard.\n\nThe references used for this document were: principally the ETSI DMR standard delivered as\n\nTS 102 361-1\n\nTS 102 361-2\n\nTS 102 361-3\n\nRadio hardware\n\nand also existing source code in theandprojects, Wikipedia articles and public information available in online communities, especially GNU Radio and MMDVM.\n\nThe DMR transmission utilizes the time division multiple access scheme (TDMA) with two timeslots per physical channel, therefore a SDR hardware platform is required which supports TDMA transmissions (either in in full-duplex mode or semi-duplex mode).\n\nThe following easily available SDR radios are fulfilling this requirement: LimeSDR-mini, LimeNet-Micro, Ettus USRP bus devices, BladeRF. Other potential targets could be the ADALM-Pluto (which would require modifications to the support libraries and FPGA image) and the AntSDR E200.\n\nThe DMR transceiver described in this page was developed and tested using the LimeSDR-mini board from Lime Microsystems. The GNU Radio library used by it is gr-limesdr which supports receive and transmit timestamps.\n\n\n\nLimeSDR-mini board\n\nTo be useful in real-life applications, several additional components would also be required, among them a power amplifier and RF switch capable of very fast switching from receive mode to transmit mode, according to the strict PA ramp-up and ramp-down time required by the DMR standard. The PA and RX/TX switching as well as software support for them are considered out-of-scope for this document and will not be discussed here.\n\nSoftware\n\nDMR reception\n\nThere exist a number of open source software packages that fully or partly implement a Digital Mobile Radio MS receiver:\n\n\n\nDSD (digital speech decoder), which includes among other supported digital modes a console based DMR receiver (original open source package)\n\ngr-dsd, a GNU Radio out-of-tree module that wraps DSD and allows it to be used in GNU Radio\n\nSDRTrunk, a cross-platform Java based SDR receiver supporting a number of SDR devices and supporting DMR as well as advanced Tier III trunking features\n\nDSD-FME, a console based DMR receiver derived from DSD which adds advanced Tier III trunking related features among the digital modes it supports\n\ndsdcc, a port of the original DSD to C++ which is shipped by most major Linux distributions\n\nDMR transmission\n\nMost SDR receiver applications and frameworks support receiving DMR digital voice and packet data, using either custom code or any of the above programs as a base. If you are interested only in receiving DMR transmissions, you should use one of them, since the DMR modem described here does not support many of the features provided by them.\n\nTo my knowledge, only a single widely used open source software package implements a DMR MS transmitter as well as a receiver:\n\n\n\nOP25, Osmocom open Project 25\n\nThe DMR transceiver contained inis also based on GNU Radio, however the code stack is different in some ways and much more powerful in the receiver functionality, including DMR Tier 3 trunking reception. It may also have some transmit limitations related to TDMA timing.\n\nDMR employs a 4FSK modulation filtered with root-raised cosine filters (BT=0.2) at both the transmitter and the receiver, with a symbol rate of 4800 symbols / second and a bitrate of 9600 bits per second (for the downlink signal). The symbol deviation is 1944 Hz at the symbol centre. A physical channel is divided into two logical channels via a time division multiple access scheme having two timeslots spanning 30 milliseconds each.\n\nWhile the BS downlink transmission contains both timeslots and is continuous, the MS uplink transmission contains only one timeslot and is discontinuous. During the transmission, the MS can switch to receive mode for the duration of the unused transmit time, and can monitor the downlink for call control information and repeater signal quality monitoring if the BS operates in aligned channel timing mode. Technically a MS can also make duplex calls like a mobile phone, but this requires the BS to operate in offset channel timing mode.\n\nIn the Direct Mode of Operation (DMO), each MS takes turns being the timing leader and only one timeslot carries useful payload, although some radios may transmit both timeslots. To transmit, the MS does not need to previously acquire a time base, and will use it's own time for outgoing DMR frames.\n\nDMR modem\n\nThe implementation of the DMR MS transceiver which is described here does not use code from the above software packages. Instead, it consists of basic GNU Radio blocks for the 4FSK modulation and demodulation, and uses the DMR data link (DLL) and call control (CCL) layers code contained in the MMDVMHost program. In addition, the DMO receiver makes use of the DMRDMORX code from MMDVM, adapted to function inside a GNU Radio block. Some parts of the call control layer are custom code written specifically for this.\n\nThe goals of this proof-of-concept work are to serve as a base for current or future development of the following features:\n\n\n\nvoice calls in repeater mode with MMDVM-based repeaters\n\nvoice calls in DMO mode with other DMR radios\n\nusing as DMR audio payload the Codec2 vocoder - 2400 bits/s (with potential FEC added) or 3200 bits/s (no FEC)\n\ndata calls\n\nimplementing and testing DMR Tier 3 trunking features as a subscriber unit (MS)\n\nprovide a test bed for full duplex voice calls as defined in TS 102 361-4\n\nprovide a test bed for IPv4 transport over packet data calls as defined in TS 102 361-3 (IP bearer service)\n\nThe software DMR modem has the following wanted basic features:\n\n\n\nEncoding and decoding of Link Control information messages, graphical display of call control information\n\nEncoding and decoding of Embedded Data: talker alias and GPS positioning information\n\nEncoding and decoding of Color Code\n\nSelection of timeslot used for transmission and reception\n\nVocoder and audio bitrate selection\n\nCall type selection for transmission: group call and private call\n\nMode selection (repeater or DMO)\n\nEncoding and decoding of Source Id and Destination Id\n\nOption for reception in promiscuous mode (ignore color code and timeslot)\n\nGNU Radio flowgraphs\n\nThe diagrams below contain a high level overview of the GNU Radio flowgraphs. To find out more details, you can take a look at the source code.\n\nThe DMR BS downlink receiver can only decode continuous BS transmissions, and is written as a basic 4FSK demodulator flowgraph, consisting of resampler, frequency demodulation, RRC symbol filtering, symbol synchronization, phase modulator, interleaver, slicer, symbol to bit mapping and bit unpacking. A custom GNU Radio sink handles the frame synchronization using the DMR SYNC sequences, as well as time synchronization with the BS via time tags and sample counters.\n\n\n\nThe DMR DMO receiver can only handle the discotinuous transmission characteristic of the DMO mode, where one timeslot is used for the payload and the other timeslot remains unused through the duration of the call. The DMO receiver is a self contained GNU Radio block that implements the MMDVM DMO receiver without any major modifications except for using floating point sample representations instead of 16 bit fixed point samples.\n\nThe DMR transmitter flowgraph is a common 4FSK modulator for both repeater and DMO modes, and consists of a custom DMR source which adds time tags to the output, bit to symbol mapping and conversion, RRC filtering and upsampling, frequency modulation and handling unused time. Since the tranmsission uses a single timeslot but the source produces data for both timeslots, after frequency modulation a constant carrier is produced at the output during the duration of the unused timeslot. This carrier is zeroed out in another block downstream of the frequency modulator to avoid signal transmission during unused time. The current code uses the full duplex operation mode of the SDR device, since transmit / receive switching and PA control are not implemented.\n\n\n\nDMR timing\n\nTDMA timing recovery is achieved in the DMR sink block, where alignment with the BS-provided timing is done using time tags emitted by the LineSDR source and also via received symbol (and therefore samples) counting. The time base is established after both the common acces channel (CACH) and a valid frame have been decoded in the downlink.\n\n\n\nTransmission in repeater mode consists of two steps: first a downlink activate control signalling block (CSBK) is transmitted, which wakes up the BS downlink continuous tranmission. This transmission contains IDLE frames, with embedded SYNC sequences, which enables fast time synchronization by the MS. After transmitting this intial CSBK frame, the radio switches back to receive mode. The second step requires the receiver to synchronize on the BS transmission and successfuly receive the common access channel (CACH). Afterwards the continuous MS transmission can occur on the BS uplink channel. Therefore it is not possible for the MS to transmit voice without having previously acquired the BS timing. Transmit timing requires taking into account the flowgraph processing latency, as well as internal audio latencies. Once established on the BS time base, outgoing frames are tagged with a time in the future allowing the SDR device to transmit them at precise times corresponding to the timeslots expected by the BS. The transmit time for timeslot 1 in the case where the BS uses aligned timing should be immediately after reception of BS sourced timeslot 1 payload and after the guard time between the timeslots has passed. However, this is not possible to achieve here due to the large latency involved in both the receiver and transmitter. Therefore the next suitable time for transmission is selected as evidenced in the image below, which introduces the delay pictured. Reducing this delay is the most challenging issue.\n\n\n\nVocoder\n\nMost DMR radios use AMBE as the vocoder responsible for encoding and decoding voice speech. For amateur radio operators, there are several options:\n\n\n\nAMBE USB stick, an USB dongle containing the vocoder chip. This is the best solution for decoding AMBE speech, however it requires an external USB device.\n\nThe vocoder plugin used by the amateur radio application DroidStar , based on mbelib. Its code may be covered by existing software patents, therefore its usage is problematic in open source applications.\n\n, based on mbelib. Its code may be covered by existing software patents, therefore its usage is problematic in open source applications. Codec2 as the vocoder, an entirely open source voice codec developed by David Rowe VK5DGR and others. No external USB hardware is required for it. Using this vocoder would make audio transmissions completely incompatible with existing DMR radios.\n\nWhile any of the above options could be used in future work, Codec2 was chosen as the main solution for the open source DMR transceiver described here. This vocoder supports multiple bitrates, from as low as 450 bits/s to as high as 3200 bits/s.\n\nThe vocoder socket specified in ETSI TS 102 361-1 consists of 216 bits of voice per DMR frame (lasting 30 milliseconds), which are divided in three encoded audio frames that can decoded to 20 milliseconds PCM audio each. The AMBE voice bitrate used in DMR is 2450 bits/s with added forward error correction, for a total bitrate of 3600 bits/s.\n\nThe Codec2 bitrates which are usable with this vocoder socket are 2400 bits/s with some forward error correction (potentially a rate 2/3 convolutional code) or using the remaining bits for additional in-band signalling, or the 3200 bits/s without any forward error correction added but with remaining bits used for additional signalling.\n\nThis implementation can use both Codec2 bitrates which are made user-selectable, however no FEC is currently added to the 2400 bits/s variant. Any potential FEC option should be standardized by the amateur radio community, since FEC decoding and re-encoding also needs to be performed by the DMR BS (repeater) as well.\n\nOne limitation of the current code is the lack of pre-generated silence frames to be appended when no voice input is present. This can generate some unpleasant noises at the end of a transmission as the operator closes the audio stream. This should be corrected in future work.\n\nThe DMR Feature Set ID (FID) is an information element included in data and link control payloads and used to identify manufacturer specific feature sets. Two common FID values are used by MMDVM DMR repeaters: ETSI and DMRA. If the information element matches these values, the repeater will use AMBE forward error correction decoding and re-encoding to correct bit errors in voice bursts. If this AMBE forward error correction code would be used on Codec2 voice bursts, it would generate unwanted bit errors leading to unusable audio payloads. Therefore, it is proposed that DMR transmissions utilizing Codec2 as the vocoder should set the FID value to a different value to identify themselves and potentially run a custom forward error correction algorithm. The identifier proposed here for Codec2 is 0xC2 and possibly 0xC3, to distinguish between the two Codec2 bitrate variants.\n\nChallenges\n\nThere were several problems that surfaced during testing. Some of them could be worked around.\n\n\n\nDevice dropping samples to be transmitted, usually after a change in device configuration was made: changing gains, switching from semi-duplex mode to duplex and vice-versa, etc. Normally this should not happen, but a mitigation was found: locking the receive and transmit flowgraphs during such changes prevents samples from being dropped or the time base being lost.\n\nThe DMO receiver was initially written to use the GNU Radio correlation estimation block. While this block can find a know sample sequence correlation reliably, the DMO receiver implemented using it did not work very well, probably because of a lack of understanding of tag positions and values relative to correlation peak. However, the MMDVM DMO receiver worked 100% reliably, so the GNU Radio blocks were replaced with it.\n\nLarge latency involving the receive and transmit flowgraphs. Reducing this latency is very challenging and requires a very good understanding of GNU Radio architecture or a complete rewrite of the code. The latency issue could not be solved.\n\nTag positions delayed after passing through the rational resampler blocks. According to the documentation, samples should be delayed by the filter relative to tags. The user is supposed to call declare_sample_delay for such blocks and let the scheduler know what the expected delay is. However in this case calling this method just made the delay of tags relative to samples even larger. Luckily, the timing still worked, probably because tags were delayed by the same amount in the receiver and transmitter flowgraphs. An unsolved mystery so far.\n\nCredits\n\nSince most of the DMR code used here is taken from MMDVMHost, I would like to thank Jonathan Naylor G4KLX (the author of MMDVM and MMDVMHost) for allowing me to use his code as a base for the DMR modem described above.\n\nSource code\n\nThe source code which accompanies the present document can be found in the Git repository and is released in version 0.9.1-3. The functionality is work in progress and likely to suffer extensive changes in the future.\n\nDemo\n\nVideo of a DMR transmission and reception using the LimeSDR-mini in duplex mode:\n\n\n\n"}

In fact, after he announced the pause, Trump said, \"bond markets are tricky.\"\n\nHowever, the claim that Carney had orchestrated the bond sell-off alongside the European Union and Japan was not confirmed. It came from the newsletter of Dean Blundell, a staunch supporter of Carney in Canada's next federal election and a former \"shock jock.\"\n\nSnopes has contacted Blundell, asking him to explain how he came upon this story and to clarify some points from his allegations. Snopes also contacted Carney's office asking for confirmation of Blundell's claims. Lastly, we have reached out to several fixed income analysts to inquire about the plausibility of such a scheme.\n\nTen days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a pause in the sweeping reciprocal tariffs he'd imposed a week prior, rumors continued to spread that he had been forced to soften his trade stance because former central banker and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney had orchestrated a massive sale of U.S. bonds.\n\nFor example, a post on Facebook made the allegation, saying Carney had put Trump \"firmly in his place,\" and that Trump had then stopped referring to Canada as the \"51st state\" (archived):\n\nAnother post on Facebook said Carney's supposed move was a \"checkmate\" (archived):\n\nUsers also shared another post relaying the same story. A summary of story appeared on X and again on Bluesky. Further, Snopes readers searched the website seeking confirmation that Carney was behind the sell-off.\n\nThe allegations stemmed from a newsletter installment by Dean Blundell, a Canadian former radio personality whom media outlets like the Toronto Star have described as a \"shock jock\" — a radio presenter who relies on offensive words and exaggeration to build a listenership. Blundell's former radio station CFNY-FM suspended him in 2013 after one controversy too many. He then joined CJCL-AM, a sports radio station, until the station dropped his show in 2017. He has since hosted an independent podcast and launched a newsletter on Substack.\n\nAs a new federal election approached in Canada, Blundell has posted content in support of Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister in March 2025 and who, as the leader of the Liberal Party, was running against Pierre Poilièvre of the Conservative Party. Blundell's stance has also been staunchly anti-Trump and anti-Poilièvre.\n\nSnopes has yet to confirm that Carney orchestrated a U.S. Treasurys sell-off in closed-door meetings with European and Japanese leaders. We contacted Blundell to ask how he first came upon the information he relayed in his newsletter. We will update this report should he respond.\n\nBlundell asserts Carney retaliated against U.S. tariffs with bonds\n\nBundell was correct that a downturn in the U.S. Treasurys market forced Trump to pause tariffs on April 9, 2025:\n\nWhen a reporter asked what justified the pause, Trump replied: \"The bond market is very tricky.\"\n\nIndeed, after Trump announced the sweeping reciprocal tariffs on April 2, a dynamic experts have deemed \"dangerous\" took hold of U.S. security markets. Typically, a drop in stock prices correlates with an increase in bond prices as investors seek refuge in U.S. Treasurys.\n\nHowever, two days after the tariffs announcement, the price of bonds began to fall along with the price of stocks, forcing bond yields up. Synchronized sell-off events can lead investors to abandon U.S. securities. Further, the consequences of a sharp increase in bond yields can lead to an increase in borrowing costs both for the government and for businesses and households, leading to an economic downturn.\n\nCarney, an accomplished economist and the former governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, understands this mechanism. Further, Carney steered monetary policy in Canada during the Great Recession of 2008, when credit around the world nearly froze. But in his story, Blundell asserted that Carney slowly amassed U.S. Treasurys — government debt in the form of bonds — in early 2025.\n\nIt is true that Treasurys holdings jumped in February 2025, led by Canada and Japan, who acquired more long-term U.S. debt. This happened just as trading tension escalated between the U.S. and Canada. When we reached out to Blundell, we asked when Carney would have started to do this, given he only became prime minister of Canada on March 14, 2025.\n\nBlundell is also correct that other governments can hold Treasurys. For example, the U.S.' largest creditor is Japan, which held more than $1 trillion in Treasury securities in early 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. The second largest is China, with $760.8 billion. In third place is the U.K., with $740.2 billion. Canada holds $350.8 billion.\n\nHow the scheme allegedly took place\n\nIn his newsletter, Blundell alleged that, after Canada acquired more Treasurys, Carney met European Union leaders during his trip to the U.K. and France on March 17, 2025. In anticipation of higher tariffs in early April, Blundell said the prime minister and EU leaders met behind closed doors — meetings that also included Japan — and persuaded them to sell their collective holdings of U.S. Treasurys slowly but in concert once Trump announced the reciprocal tariffs.\n\nIn the first few weeks of his presidency, Trump indeed touted a significant tariff announcement in April, though he gave no details about its magnitude. However, 25% tariffs on Canadian products had been in place since March 4, 2025.\n\nAccording to Blundell, when the tariff announcement finally came, Canada, the EU and Japan were in a position to sell Treasurys and rattle Trump enough to make him remove the tariffs.\n\n\"China's still in the crosshairs—125% duties are no joke—but Canada? The EU? Japan? They're off the hit list,\" Blundell wrote. \"For now, at least. Why? Because Carney's play wasn't noise. It was power.\"\n\nIndeed, Trump lowered tariffs on the EU and Japan to 10% and paused them for 90 days. He also raised tariffs on China to 125%. However, as per the White House, tariffs on Canada were still in place — the nation was excluded from the pause in reciprocal tariffs. When Snopes reached out to Blundell, we also asked what he meant when he said Canada was \"off the hit list,\" alongside Japan and the EU. We will update this report should he respond."}

Here’s how…\n\nWhat to do…\n\nWindows 11 has a facility to set up a secure USB key. But I prefer to use the free third-party app USB Raptor, which gives me a little more control over how my key works.\n\nGet a USB flash drive without any files loaded on it. I’m using the SanDisk 16GB Ultra Fit, which cost me $9 on Amazon.\n\nDownload and install USB Raptor and launch the app. It will launch in configuration mode with three steps to complete to set up your secure key.\n\nStep 1: Choose an encryption password and write it down somewhere so you don’t forget it.\n\nStep 2: Plug in your USB flash drive and choose the correct drive letter it was allocated. Now click Create k3y file.\n\nStep 3: Before you enable USB Raptor, you’ll want to create a backdoor login in case you lose your key.\n\nUSB Raptor launches a three step configuration process. Dominic Bayley / Foundry\n\nCreate a backdoor login\n\nIn the top-right corner of the app click in the box next to Advanced configuration.\n\nClick on Lock features in the top menu. Navigate down to Backdoor access.\n\nNow click Generate RUID file. This will create a file on your desktop that will allow you to bypass the lockscreen if you forget your password and the USB key is removed from your PC.\n\nCreating the RUID file for backdoor access in USB Raptor. Dominic Bayley / Foundry\n\nPro tip: If you’re not keen on using USB Raptor, there are numerous other security apps to choose from. Two others include Predator and Rohos Logon Key Free. While some of what you can do in these apps is free you will have to pay to unlock a full suite of features.\n\nMore things to note:\n\nBe sure to label your USB flash drive security key so that you never mix it up with other drives you own.\n\nUse a USB drive with a fast read/write speed to make your login quicker.\n\nBefore you create a key, back up your data to ensure you don’t lose it.\n\nIf you’ve followed the steps above, you should now have a secure key that will make your PC more secure — as well as backdoor access in case anything goes wrong. If you don’t want to use your key, simply deactivate it in the app.\n\nFurther reading: How to turn a USB flash drive into a portable gaming console"}

The largest is Villa Pisani, whose origins date back to the 18th century, when the Pisani di Santo Stefano, one of the richest families of the Venetian nobility Venetian, reached their apogee, even managing to express a doge, Alvise Pisani, who was first Venetian ambassador to Louis XIV’s France, after which he ascended to the doge’s throne in 1735, when Villa Pisani was under construction.\n\nConstruction of the complex began in 1721, when the Pisani family entrusted the task to architect Gerolamo Frigimelica (Padua, 1653 - Modena, 1732), also the author of the sumptuous Palazzo Pisani in the sestiere of San Marco in Venice, and then to his colleague Francesco Maria Preti (Castelfranco Veneto, 1701 - 1774), who succeeded Frigimelica after his death in 1732. It took a few years to see the work completed, which ended in 1756. The villa, however, remained with the Pisani for a short time: in the late 18th century, the time of the decline of the Serenissima, the family also suffered heavy setbacks, and the villa had to be sold off to meet the debts the Pisani had accumulated. Villa Pisani thus became the property of Napoleon Bonaparte, who in turn gave it to his stepson Eugene de Beauharnais. After the Restoration, it became the imperial villa of the Habsburgs, who spent long holiday stays here. Then, following the Unification of Italy, the villa became part of the property of the Savoy crown, and in 1884, after a period of neglect, it was turned into a museum.\n\nVilla Pisani in Stra, aerial view.

Photo: Ministry of Culture\n\nGiambattista Tiepolo, Apotheosis of the Pisani Family (1761-1762; fresco, 12.7 x 7.7 m; Stra, Villa Pisani)\n\nVilla Pisani is an imposing structure that behind its sober neoclassical façade conceals dozens of rooms (there are 168 in all, although those that can be visited number around 30), including the spectacular ballroom where Giambattista Tiepolo frescoed theApotheosis of the Pisani Family, one of the greatest masterpieces of the eighteenth century in the world. Attached to the villa is then a splendid 14-hectare park with stables, the 18th-century Coffee House, English grove, tropical greenhouses and one of the most famous labyrinths inItaly, the Labyrinth of Villa Pisani precisely, which also became famous because it is the protagonist of one of the best-known scenes in the novel Il Fuoco by Gabriele D’Annunzio, who visited the villa after its transformation into a museum, dedicating unforgettable pages to it. In the novel, the young protagonist, the poet Stelio Effrena, travels through the labyrinth together with his lover, the Foscarina, in a subtle game of love among the maze’s meandering paths: “A gate of rusty iron closed it, between two pillars bearing two Lovers riding dolphins of stone. There was no glimpse beyond the gate except the beginning of a medium and a kind of tangled and hard forest, a mysterious and thick appearance. From the center of the tangle rose a tower, and at the top of the tower the statue of a warrior seemed to stand at the lookouts. ’Have you ever entered a labyrinth?” asked Stelio to his friend. ’Never,’ she replied. They lingered to admire that fallacious game composed by an ingenious gardener for the delight of ladies and cicisbei in the time of calcagnini and guardinfanti. But neglect and age had inselvated it, saddened it; had stripped it of all semblance of gracefulness and equality; had changed it into a closed patch between brown and yellowish, full of inextricable ambiguities, where the slanting rays of sunset reddened it so that the tufts here and there there looked like pyres burning without smoke. ’It is open,’ said Stelio, feeling the gate give way in leaning against it. ’See?’ He pushed the rusty iron that screeched on the shaky hinges; then he gave a step crossing the boundary.\"\n\nThe labyrinth is also due to the design of Gerolamo Frigimelica, and probably the idea of enriching the park of the villa with a maze is due precisely to the future doge Alvise Pisani, who during his stay in France perhaps had the opportunity to appreciate the labyrinth of Versailles, later removed in 1778 at the behest of King Louis XVI, who had it replaced with an English garden. It had been designed, as D’Annunzio writes, for the enjoyment of guests: the Vate thus imagined the ladies invited to the villa wandering around the meandering maze, dressed according to the fashion of the time, that is, with the “calcagnini,” typical eighteenth-century Venetian shoes provided with a high wedge (they had been invented to avoid the ’high water), and the “guardinfanti,” the structure composed of metal or wicker hoops that served to inflate the skirts by making the garment take on that particular bell shape seen in portraits of the time. Apparently, one of the most popular games played by the labyrinth’s frequenters involved a lady masquerading on the turret and revealing her identity only to the gentleman who, in a race with others, managed to reach her in the shortest possible time.\n\nIt is one of the largest labyrinths in Europe, as well as one of the most intricate and difficult. The difficulty is due not only to the vastness of its proportions, but also to the fact that it is a labyrinth that has only one path leading to the center, and each junction or fork never allows you to find an alternative route, but always leads to a dead end, with the result that if you come to a wall you have to perforce retrace your steps trying to remember where you found the fork and choose another path. For this reason it can also take a long time before one is able to find the road that leads to the destination. It is even said that Napoleon, after acquiring the villa, wanted to try his hand at the Labyrinth of Villa Pisani in 1807, but he failed to solve it, and again tradition has it that in 1934, when Villa Pisani was the scene of a summit between Hitler and Mussolini, the two dictators preferred not to measure themselves against the labyrinth because, mindful of the anecdote about Napoleon, they would have preferred to avoid embarrassment. The labyrinth has a circular floor plan and consists of nine concentric circles that lead from the entrance (the only entrance) to the center where a stone turret towers, with double-row centered openings, the top of which can be reached by double a spiral staircase, equipped with a wrought-iron balustrade, that wraps around the structure. Above the turret, the final goal: the statue of Minerva, goddess of wisdom, an indispensable virtue for keeping calm and reaching the center of the labyrinth. The corridors are separated by boxwood hedges(buxus sempervirens) that allow one to always see the center: boxwood is a typical plant for labyrinths, since it is very hardy, requires little maintenance, can be ’tamed’ into many forms, and is an evergreen. However, it is not the original essence of the maze: in ancient times it was in fact composed of hornbeam hedges, a plant that was then gradually replaced until by the early twentieth century the labyrinth was already entirely made of boxwood, which was evidently chosen because of its characteristics, first and foremost the fact that it can maintain the coloring of its leaves in all seasons, while the hornbeam is a deciduous plant (which, however, does not lose its leaves: they remain attached to the branches but yellow).\n\nLabyrinth of Villa Pisani.

Photo: Alessandro Pasquali / Danae Project\n\nBortolo Gaetano Carboni, Torrione del Labirinto nel Giardino Pisani a Stra (1790-1792; engraving; Turin, Academy of Sciences)\n\nFrancesco Guardi, Drawing of the Labyrinth in Villa Pisani (1773; watercolor pen and brown ink, 127 x 131 mm; Cleveland, Cleveland Museum of Art)\n\nThe labyrinth of Villa Pisani has always maintained the same structure, since eighteenth-century prints are known to show the maze as it is now. Even one of the greatest artists of the eighteenth century, Francesco Guardi (Venice, 1712 - 1793) passed through here: in fact, one of his drawings sketching a corridor of the Villa Pisani Labyrinth is preserved. And of course, one cannot count the novels, even contemporary ones, that have scenes set here. The only change was made in 1809, when, at the behest of Eugene de Beauharnais, a slight widening of the path was decided: the circle of the labyrinth, which was accessed, as the ancient prints attest, by an entrance placed along a wall, was in fact added some corridors on four sides to inscribe the structure in a trapezium designed by the engineer Mezzani, “Royal Architect and Inspector of the Royal Palaces of Venice and Stra” as it is indicated in the Napoleonic documents. But the circle part has always remained unchanged. And it has also been widely imitated, all over the world: several labyrinths in fact recall the structure of the one at Villa Pisani (the closest geographically is the one at Villa Gaggia in Belluno, which also has a very similar turret in the center).\n\nRestored in the 1970s after a period of decay, the labyrinth is once again offered to visitors to Villa Pisani, who, at certain times of the year, can put on the clothes of 18th-century nobles and try to solve the pattern: a labyrinth that is at once amusing and disturbing (as emerges from the pages of D’Annunzio, where the Foscarina feels some anxiety as she navigates its meanders), because it is designed to pass the time of the villa’s guests but also to disorientate, because when you get to the turret you can enjoy beautiful views and serene moments of tranquility, but then once you get down you have to retrace the whole way back. A labyrinth of ambiguous charm that never ceases to seduce all those who try to walk through it.\n\nThe Labyrinth of Villa Pisani in Stra, suggestions of D'Annunzio and an intricate pathway\n\nWarning: the translation into English of the original Italian article was created using automatic tools.

Videos posted to YouTube also exemplified the common mix-up. One example, a 50-second clip from the game show \"The Pyramid,\" showed a contestant describing a unit of time – a \"jiffy\" – as \"peanut butter.\"\n\nThe word \"jiffy,\" which Merriam-Webster defines as \"a very short period of time,\" is not – and has never been – the name of the popular peanut butter product. As a result, we've rated the claim false.\n\nThe peanut butter company writes on its website:\n\nWe have always been called Jif® since our company was first founded in 1958!\n\nJif's website also says the company chose the name \"because it was easy to say, spell and remember!\"\n\nAs writers for publications like Esquire and Yahoo have noted, confusion over the brand's name is an example of the \"Mandela Effect,\" a phenomenon the Cleveland Clinic describes as a collective misremembering of facts or details about a particular person, event or pop culture object.\n\nAs Snopes previously reported, this categorization of false memories is \"named after the widespread but incorrect notion that South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela died in prison during the 1980s.\"\n\nIn actuality, Mandela was released in 1990 and became South Africa's first Black president before dying 23 years later.\n\nFor decades, Snopes has investigated dozens of Mandela Effect claims on the internet, including whether the chocolate bar is named \"KitKat\" or \"Kit-Kat\" and whether Mr. Monopoly wore a monocle.\n\nFor a complete list of Mandela Effects Snopes has examined throughout the years, check out this list."}

AWS Lambdaを使用したセキュアなMCPサーバーの実装\n\n先月、AWSがMCPサーバーのリポジトリを公開し、\n\nその中にLambdaを使用したMCPサーバーの実装が含まれています。\n\nAWS環境を普段から利用されている方であれば、非常に簡単に始められます。\n\n下記のようなシンプルなLambda関数をデプロイします。\n\nこの関数は、パラメータの掛け算を行うシンプルなツールです。\n\nindex.py import json def lambda_handler ( event , context ): try : num1 = event . get ( ' num1 ' ) num2 = event . get ( ' num2 ' ) # Validate input if num1 is None or num2 is None : return { ' statusCode ' : 400 , ' body ' : json . dumps ({ ' error ' : ' Missing required parameters. Please provide both \" num1 \" and \" num2 \" . ' }) } # Convert to numbers if they are strings if isinstance ( num1 , str ): num1 = float ( num1 ) if isinstance ( num2 , str ): num2 = float ( num2 ) # Calculate the sum result = num1 + num2 # Return the result return { ' statusCode ' : 200 , ' body ' : json . dumps ({ ' num1 ' : num1 , ' num2 ' : num2 , ' sum ' : result }) } except Exception as e : # Handle any errors return { ' statusCode ' : 500 , ' body ' : json . dumps ({ ' error ' : str ( e ) }) }\n\n関数名を mcp-add-tool にして、デプロイ先を東京リージョン（ap-northeast-1）にします。\n\n実装はとてもシンプルなので、以下の手順で簡単に作成できます：\n\n1.AWSコンソールからLambda関数の「一から作成」を選択\n\n2.ランタイムは最新のPythonバージョンを選択\n\n3.「関数の作成」ボタンをクリック\n\n4.エディタに上記のコードを貼り付け\n\n5.「デプロイ」をクリック\n\nこれだけで完了です。\n\nClaude Desktopの設定を編集します。\n\nclaude_desktop_config.json { \"mcpServers\" : { \"awslabs.lambda-mcp-server\" : { \"command\" : \"uvx\" , \"args\" : [ \"awslabs.lambda-mcp-server@latest\" ], \"env\" : { \"AWS_PROFILE\" : \"you_profile\" , \"AWS_REGION\" : \"ap-northeast-1\" , \"FUNCTION_PREFIX\" : \"\" , # 使用できる関数のプレフィックスを指定するに使えます \"FUNCTION_LIST\" : \"mcp-add-tool\" , \"FUNCTION_TAG_KEY\" : \"\" , # 特定のタグを指定できます \"FUNCTION_TAG_VALUE\" : \"\" # タグ指定と一緒に使えます } }, } }\n\n今回の関数はタグやプレフィックスを付与していないため、 FUNCTION_LIST には関数名のみを指定するだけで構いません。\n\n設定の編集が完了したら、Claude Desktopを再起動するだけで新しいツールを利用できるようになります。\n\n利点\n\nAWS IAMとの統合により、細かいアクセス制御が可能\n\nLambda経由で利用できるAWSサービスを自由に活用でき、可能性は無限大\n\n実質的なMCPサーバーはAWS側でホスティングされるため、ツールの準備だけで済む\n\nAWS関連イベントでの事例紹介や技術発表に最適\n\n既存のLambdaツールを再利用できるため、車輪の再発明を避けられる\n\n欠点\n\nサービス提供の際にIAMユーザー側で権限管理が必要となり、横展開がやや難しい\n\nツールの作成はできるが、現状ではサーバー側のカスタマイズができない\n\n2. Cloudflareワーカーによるトークン認証のMCPサーバー\n\nCloudflareワーカーを使ってMCPサーバーを実装する方法とサンプルコードを紹介します。\n\nMCPサーバーについては公式ブログで詳しく解説されています：\n\nプロジェクトの初期化\n\n実装は非常に簡単です。公式のテンプレートを使ってプロジェクトを初期化しましょう。\n\nnpm create cloudflare@latest -- mcp-server-bearer-auth --template=cloudflare/ai/demos/mcp-server-bearer-auth\n\nまたは、以下のリポジトリをローカルにクローンすることもできます。\n\nKVネームスペースの作成\n\nデプロイに必要なKVネームスペースを作成します。\n\ncd mcp-server-bearer-auth wrangler kv namespace create { 任意のnamespace }\n\nコマンド実行後、以下のような出力が表示されます：\n\n🌀 Creating namespace with title \"worker-mcp-server-bearer-auth\" ✨ Success! Add the following to your configuration file in your kv_namespaces array: [[kv_namespaces]] binding = \"mcp_server_bearer_auth\" id = \"you-id\"\n\n設定ファイルの編集\n\n表示されたidの値をコピーして、wrangler.jsoncのOAUTH_KVのidを置き換えます。\n\nwrangler.jsonc \"kv_namespaces\" : [ { \"binding\" : \"OAUTH_KV\" , \"id\" : \"{you-id}\" } ]\n\n機能紹介\n\nこのサンプルコードには、次の2つのツールが実装されています：\n\n掛け算ツール\n\nトークン取得ツール\n\nローカル開発環境での確認\n\nローカルサーバーを起動してみましょう。\n\nnpm run dev ... ⎔ Starting local server... [ wrangler:inf] Ready on http://localhost:8788\n\nClaude Desktopから接続するために、設定ファイルを修正します。\n\nclaude_desktop_config.json { \"mcpServers\" : { \"example-local\" : { \"command\" : \"npx\" , \"args\" : [ \"mcp-remote\" , \"http://localhost:8788/sse\" , \"--header\" , \"Authorization: Bearer token123\" ] } } }\n\nClaude Desktopを再起動すると、2つのツールが接続されていることが確認できます。\n\n\n\nトークンを確認してみましょう。claude_desktop_config.jsonに設定したBearer tokenが正しく取得できています。\n\nCloudflareへのデプロイ\n\n次にCloudflareにデプロイします。\n\nデプロイ前にCloudflareアカウントを作成しておくことをお勧めします。クレジットカード登録不要で、無料枠も十分使えるのでとても便利です。\n\nnpm run deploy > remote-mcp-server-bearer-auth@0.0.0 deploy > wrangler deploy ⛅️ wrangler 4.11.0 ( update available 4.12.0 ) ------------------------------------------------------- Total Upload: 449.28 KiB / gzip : 87.24 KiB Worker Startup Time: 38 ms Your worker has access to the following bindings: - Durable Objects: - MCP_OBJECT: MyMCP - KV Namespaces: - OAUTH_KV: you-token - AI: - Name: AI Uploaded mcp-server-bearer-auth ( 3.73 sec ) Deployed mcp-server-bearer-auth triggers ( 0.96 sec ) https:// { you-domain } .workers.dev\n\nデプロイが完了したら、発行されたworkers.devで終わるURLを使って設定ファイルを更新します。\n\n区別しやすいように、トークンも変更しておきましょう。\n\nclaude_desktop_config.json { \"mcpServers\" : { \"example-local\" : { \"command\" : \"npx\" , \"args\" : [ \"mcp-remote\" , \"https://{you-domain}.workers.dev/sse\" , \"--header\" , \"Authorization: Bearer remoto123\" ] } } }\n\nClaude Desktopを再起動し、トークンを確認してみましょう。\n\nいい感じに最新のトークンを教えてくれました。\n\nサーバー側でトークンを取得できるため、権限管理などの追加実装も可能です。\n\n利点\n\nサーバー側のカスタマイズが容易\n\n横展開しやすい\n\n導入の敷居が低い\n\n欠点\n\nサーバー管理の手間が増える\n\nCloudflareとHono APIの知識が必要\n\nLTのネタにしづらい\n\n権限管理のための別サービス構築が必要\n\nクライアントからの定期的なヘルスチェックが横展開時の阻害にありかねない\n\n3. CloudflareワーカーによるOAuth認証プロバイダーMCPサーバー\n\nトークン認証のMCPサーバーと全体の構成と近いですが、OAuth認証プロバイダー追加することで、自前で認証システム構築する手間が省けます、こちらの記事でも紹介してます。\n\nプロジェクト初期化\n\n任意のディレクトリでアプリを初期化します。\n\nnpm create cloudflare@latest -- my-mcp-server-github-auth --template = cloudflare/ai/demos/remote-mcp-github-oauth\n\n初期化プロセス中に質問されますが、下記のよに回答しましょう。\n\nYou're in an existing git repository. Do you want to use git for version control?\n\nyes\n\nDo you want to deploy your application?\n\nNo\n\n初期化完了したら、リポジトリに入って、 OAUTH_KV を作ります。\n\ncd my-mcp-server-github-auth wrangler kv namespace create \"test-remoto-mcp(任意)\"\n\n実行したら、Cloudflareの認証画面が開かれます、事前にアカウント作っておくことをおすすめです。\n\nCloudflareはクレジットカードの登録なしでアカウントを作成でき、無料プランでも十分な機能が提供されているため、気軽に利用を始めることができます。\n\n🌀 Creating namespace with title \"worker-test-remoto-mcp\" ✨ Success! Add the following to your configuration file in your kv_namespaces array: [[kv_namespaces]] binding = \"test_remoto_mcp\" id = \"xxxxxxxxx\"\n\n実行完了したら、できた値(id)をリポジトリ配下のwrangler.jsoncのOAUTH_KVに書き換えます。\n\nwrangler.jsonc \"kv_namespaces\" : [ { \"binding\" : \"OAUTH_KV\" , + \"id\" : \"{OAUTH_KV}\" } ]\n\nここまでできたら一度デプロイしましょう。\n\nnpm run deploy\n\nデプロイ完了したら、Cloudflareワーカーのurlが表示されます、\n\nhttps://your-worker-name.your-account.workers.dev\n\nそれをコピーしておいてください、後でまた使います。\n\nGitHub OAuth Appを作る\n\nGitHub OAuth Appドキュメント\n\nGitHubにログインして、 Settings -> Developer Settings -> New OAuth App\n\nApplication name\n\n覚えやすい名前を入力しましょう。\n\nHomepage URL\n\n先コピーしたCloudflareワーカーのurlを入力しましょう、 https://your-worker-name.your-account.workers.dev 。\n\nAuthorization callback URL\n\nCloudflareワーカーのurl+/callback, https://your-worker-name.your-account.workers.dev/callback 。\n\n完了したら、クライアントIDとクライアントシークレットが発行されます、\n\nそれらをWorkerのシークレットとして追加します。\n\nnamespaceに入る値は OAUTH_KV を作った際に使った値になります。\n\nwrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID --name { namespace } wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET --name { namespace }\n\n最後、COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEYの値も作ります。\n\nopenssl rand -hex 32\n\nできた値をメモして、次のコマンド実行後、入力します。\n\nwrangler secret put COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY --name { namespace }\n\nここまででセットアップは完了しました、実際の動作を確認してみましょう。\n\nWorkers AI LLM Playgroundを開いてください。\n\nMCP Servers URLに Cloudflareワーカーのurl+ /sse を入力しましょう、\n\nhttps://your-worker-name.your-account.workers.dev/sse 。\n\nConnectを押すと、認証画面にリダイレクトされます。\n\n接続完了したら、デフォルトで実装されてる add ツールを呼び出してみます。\n\n環境変数のセットやデプロイが完了していれば、問題なく呼び出せるはずです。\n\ngithubドキュメント取得ツールを作る\n\n簡易的なGitHubリポジトリのREADME.mdの内容を取得するツールを作ります、\n\naddツール の下に下記のコードを追記します。\n\nsrc/index.ts ... this . server . tool ( ' getGithubReadme ' , ' GitHubリポジトリのREADMEファイルを取得する ' , { repositoryUrl : z . string () }, async ({ repositoryUrl }) => { try { // repositoryUrlからオーナー名とリポジトリ名を抽出 const urlParts = repositoryUrl . replace ( ' https://github.com/ ' , '' ). split ( ' / ' ) const owner = urlParts [ 0 ] const repo = urlParts [ 1 ] // READMEのraw URLを構築 const readmeUrl = `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ ${ owner } / ${ repo } /refs/heads/main/README.md` // READMEの内容を取得 const response = await fetch ( readmeUrl ) if ( ! response . ok ) { throw new Error ( `README取得エラー: ${ response . status } ${ response . statusText } ` ) } const readmeContent = await response . text () return { content : [ { type : ' text ' , text : readmeContent , }, ], } } catch ( error ) { return { content : [ { type : ' text ' , text : `エラーが発生しました: ${ error . message } ` , }, ], } } }, )\n\nこのツールはユーザーからGithubリポジトリのurl渡された際に、そのリポジトリにある README.md の中身を返すだけのシンプルなツールです。\n\n修正完了したら、再度デプロイします。\n\nnpm run deploy\n\nWorkers AI LLM Playgroundを使って検証してみよう。\n\n同じくLangfuseとの連携の話を聞いてみます。\n\nそれぽい結果が返ってきました\n\nClaude Desktopで利用する場合、下記のようにconfigファイルを修正すればいいです。\n\nclaude_desktop_config.json { \"mcpServers\" : { \"math\" : { \"command\" : \"npx\" , \"args\" : [ \"mcp-remote\" , \"https://your-worker-name.your-account.workers.dev/sse\" ], \"timeout\" : 10 } } }\n\n利点\n\nサーバー側のカスタマイズが容易\n\n横展開しやすい\n\n導入の敷居が低い\n\n欠点\n\nサーバー管理の手間が増える\n\nCloudflareとHono APIの知識が必要\n\nクライアントからの定期的なヘルスチェックが横展開時の阻害にありかねない\n\n認証ページがうまく開けなくて、無限ループによりサーバーダウンの可能性がある\n\n最後\n\nその他の方法を確認次第、追加で更新する予定です"}

Some are created for research purposes, while others tend to result in real lenses much later. There are other instances when you hear reports of launch dates, but they never truly materialize. An example is Canon RF 200-500mm f4L IS USM, which we have reported on since 2023, but there has been no official launch. But now, there are other articles that hint at the launch of another focal range that could rival Sigma.\n\nAccording to Canon Rumors, sources have said that a new lens is on the horizon, which may be launched before the Canon RF 200-500mm f4L IS USM, the RF 300-600mm f/5.6L IS USM. While there have been patents of the 200-500mm before, the 300-600mm lens only has designs of vaiable apertures. In addition, there were also reports of a super-telephoto lens, with a constant aperture of f5.6. However, that has also not been seen yet.\n\nComing back to the Canon 300-600mm lens, no other specifications have been revealed yet. All we know is that the lens is going to release and that it will be lighter than Sigma. Sigma has already announced 300-600mm f/4 DG OS Sports, which is priced at $5999. However, it is only available for Sony E and Leica L mounts. It could be the case that a new Canon 300-600mm is likely to rival this in many ways. First off, the Canon L series‘ lens size and weight. With newer iterations, the company is making bigger lenses smaller and more compact. The Sigma 300-600mm weighs 3,985g for the L-mount, and so the Canon version could be around 2700g to 7500g.\n\nCanon RF 600mm f4L\n\nThere is also the aperture, which could make a huge difference. Canon already has RF 600mm f/4L IS USM, but the $13K price tag and the size make it impossible for some to buy or lug it around. In that regard, the Canon 300-600mm could fill in the gap, which is likely to be less than $13K but definitely more than $6K. The constant f5.6 aperture is a trade-off, but some would be far happy to do so.\n\nIn addition, there is speculation that Canon may also update its RF 400mm f/2.8L IS USM and RF 600mm f/4L IS USM with 1.4 teleconverters built-in. Both lenses were introduced in 2022, and it is possible that would like to make changes before the 2026 World Cup or the Olympics. For instance, in our test, the 600mm lens had less sharpness, while the 400mm faced a bit of paint wear-off.\n\nAlthough the Canon 300-600mm is not an inexpensive lens, it is likely to be targeted at users, professionals, and high-end enthusiasts who need that extra bit of zoom range. With more companies focusing on telephoto lenses, it appears that Canon does not want to be left behind. And that is fair. A constant f5.6 aperture across the zoom range would be welcomed, but a lens that is also affordable would be a better direction for the company."}

LEGO Masters champion Mark Erickson is certainly a fan of the theme and picked it for one of his latest 24-hour build challenges. Mark had a blast incorporating as many original parts from the theme as possible, like the printed hieroglyphs, sarcophagus, and of course, the army of minifigures, while also incorporating newer elements and build techniques. The dark orange and dark azure combo definitely wouldn’t have been possible back in 1998, but it’s the perfect color combo for a pharaoh’s haunted tomb and matches the old printings.\n\nThe diorama is packed with action from a tomb raid gone horribly wrong as Johnny Thunder and friends unleash a mummy’s curse. All the familiar characters are there, but Mark supplements the crew with minifig companions who look right at home.\n\nIf Mark said this was a labor of love built over months, it would still be impressive, but somehow the Master Builder erected this epic wonder in just 24 hours.

With his deal entering its final 12 months and negotiations reportedly dragging, the numbers and performances suggest this is a decision that could significantly shape the club’s defensive future.\n\nDominance in the Duo: Konaté and Van Dijk\n\nAs Dr Phil Barter makes clear, Liverpool have a truly formidable partnership in Konaté and Virgil van Dijk. “Together, they’ve got an 81% win rate,” Barter reveals. “That’s pretty amazing.” It’s a number that simply demands respect. The data indicates that when these two start together, Liverpool not only win more but also play better at both ends of the pitch.\n\n“They have the best win percentage as a pair,” Barter continues. “They have the best defensive record and the best attacking metrics as a pair.” For a club now led by Arne Slot and facing a transitional summer, locking in consistency at centre-back should be a priority. Konaté may not be Van Dijk – “he’s not Van Dijk and I think we should be very clear about that” – but he is the closest Liverpool have to an elite number two.\n\nMetrics That Matter\n\nWhat separates Konaté from the rest isn’t just the results – it’s how he contributes to them. “He’s got a pass success rate of 90%, up there with Van Dijk’s 92%,” Barter explains, highlighting a key evolution in the Frenchman’s game. His passing game, often critiqued early in his Liverpool career, has improved substantially.\n\nWhen it comes to aerial duels, he leads Liverpool’s defenders with a 76% win rate. In terms of progressive carrying, Barter notes, “He carries the ball better…progressively 66% of centre-halves.” These aren’t vanity stats; they’re qualities that impact structure, recovery, and even attacking build-up – particularly important with Trent Alexander-Arnold’s future unclear.\n\nThe Cost of Letting Him Go\n\nThe looming reality, as Davis put it bluntly, is that “if he doesn’t renew soon, they will sell him this summer.” Liverpool cannot afford to lose such a key figure and scramble for an immediate replacement – especially when, as Barter notes, “Konaté has played a World Cup final, a Champions League final, set to be a title winner.”\n\nThere are options being considered, like Bournemouth’s Dean Huijsen. But as Barter points out, while promising, “he is a kid,” and Konaté “is above Huijsen by a bit of distance.” The Frenchman’s experience and physicality remain unmatched within the potential alternatives.\n\nValue Versus Replacement\n\nCould Liverpool replace Konaté if he left? Technically, yes. Barter acknowledges that “you could potentially go and buy…center-halves that have got a similar passing range and are younger.” But would they come with Premier League experience, Champions League pedigree, and established chemistry with Van Dijk? Highly unlikely.\n\nAs Davis highlights, “You don’t want to mess with that [Konaté-VVD pairing]. You want to lock that in.” In a season where Liverpool’s defence under Slot will require both steel and subtlety, Konaté provides a rare blend of both.\n\nFinal Whistle\n\nThe verdict from both Dr Phil Barter and Dave Davis is unequivocal. Konaté is more than just a partner to Van Dijk – he’s central to Liverpool’s defensive identity. Letting him run down his contract would be a footballing and financial error of the highest order.\n\n“He’s a superb centre-half,” says Barter. “He’s certainly in our best pairing.” The win rate, the metrics, the on-ball development – all roads point to the same conclusion: Liverpool must renew Ibrahima Konaté."}

While those deals signal Liverpool’s intent to retain key senior players, Diaz’s situation is altogether more uncertain.\n\nSigned in January 2022 from FC Porto, Diaz has grown into a vital part of the Reds’ attacking setup. With 15 goals across all competitions this season—his best return in a Liverpool shirt—he’s become one of Arne Slot’s most effective outlets. However, as Football Insider rightly points out, he remains on the same contract he signed when he arrived, earning a reported £55,000 per week.\n\nIn today’s Premier League wage structure, especially for a first-choice forward at a title-challenging club, that figure is far below market rate. It’s no surprise then, that talks are now being fast-tracked after Salah and Van Dijk’s renewals were finalised.\n\nClubs Circling as Exit Becomes Likely\n\nThe sense of urgency isn’t just internal. According to Football Insider and corroborated by other sources such as TEAMtalk, the likelihood of Diaz departing this summer is “sky high.” Reports state Liverpool would be willing to sanction a sale if a £60 million bid lands on the table.\n\nThat valuation appears to be well within reach for clubs in the Saudi Pro League. “Our sources indicate SPL deal-makers would be willing to meet Liverpool’s valuation and the gigantic salary they’ll put on the table will appeal to Diaz too,” states the report. It’s a sentiment that paints a clear picture: if a club is willing to offer both Liverpool and Diaz what they want, this move is more probable than possible.\n\nBarcelona also reportedly maintain an interest, although whether they can match the financial clout of Saudi clubs remains in question. What is certain is that should Diaz leave, Liverpool will have to move swiftly in a rapidly evolving transfer market to secure a replacement.\n\nSlot’s Summer Overhaul Well Underway\n\nIt’s worth noting that Diaz isn’t the only significant figure who could leave Anfield. Trent Alexander-Arnold looks increasingly likely to join Real Madrid on a free transfer, and Darwin Nunez is also expected to depart for Saudi Arabia. As Football Insider outlines, “Additions are also being sought at centre-back, left-back, central midfield and striker.”\n\nArne Slot is guiding Liverpool through a title-challenging campaign, but the summer ahead will be a true test of his managerial mettle. The Dutchman is shaping the squad in his own image, and decisions like those surrounding Diaz are indicative of the cold, calculated moves required at the elite level.\n\nDiaz’s Contributions Cannot Be Ignored\n\nIt’s easy to understand why the club want to review Diaz’s situation. Despite intense speculation, he has continued to perform at a high level. A tally of 15 goals from the wing, combined with his tireless work rate and ability to break lines, has been crucial to Liverpool’s attack.\n\nStill, football is a business, and the club must balance sentiment with strategy. Diaz’s contract is not just a reflection of his past—it must align with the club’s future wage structure and strategic priorities. As Football Insider notes, Diaz’s future is “about to be decided.” If no new deal is reached, expect movement—fast.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a Liverpool fan’s perspective, this report is both concerning and understandable.\n\nFirst off, it’s baffling that a player as influential as Luis Diaz is still on his original terms. £55,000 per week may seem substantial, but in footballing terms—and for a starting forward in a title-challenging team—it’s not just underwhelming, it’s disrespectful. His consistency and drive have often galvanised the team, especially when Salah or Nunez haven’t fired.\n\nThat said, if the club has already budgeted for a summer overhaul, there’s a financial logic to cashing in while Diaz’s value is high. Still, £60m feels slightly under par, especially when considering what it could cost to bring in a replacement of similar calibre. If Barcelona and Saudi clubs are genuinely in the mix, Liverpool must play the long game here. Bidding wars should be encouraged, not avoided.\n\nThere’s also the emotional aspect. Fans have grown to love Diaz’s fearless style and flair. He plays like someone who understands what it means to wear the shirt. Letting that kind of passion walk away without exhausting all contract avenues would be tough to swallow.\n\nArne Slot faces a huge test this summer. How he handles key exits—particularly someone like Diaz—will speak volumes about his strategy. Supporters will back a rebuild, but only if they see ambition and fairness in the club’s dealings."}

On the Chat G&G podcast, Gags Tandon and Grizz Khan delved into what comes next for a team that has stunned the Premier League this season. The key takeaway? Liverpool’s summer is about building around, not replacing, their senior core.\n\nSenior Players in the Loop\n\nOne of the most telling insights came from the discussion around the timing of Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah’s new deals. Grizz Khan explained the strategic communication likely involved: “Slot, Edwards and Hughes would have said, ‘Hey Mo, hey Verge, this is the situation. We’re looking to build and strengthen.’”\n\nHe added, “Maybe not getting their thoughts, but just letting them know. I’m not saying they’re getting their opinions like, ‘What do you think, Verge? Should we sign player X?’ No… but just letting them know — this is our plan, this is how we’re moving.”\n\nAccording to Grizz, it’s clear both players “liked what they heard” and their decision to re-sign suggests trust in the club’s direction. “If there are new recruits to be brought in in very important roles and positions, then you’d expect the ownership to be speaking with the senior members and getting their views… or at the very least, keeping them informed.”\n\nIdentifying the Gaps\n\nGags pointed to Virgil’s own comments last summer, highlighting the defender’s awareness of the squad’s needs: “One of the things I think Verge was really adamant about last summer was, ‘We need players.’ You could hear him say it.”\n\nNow, with the title nearly secured, both hosts expect the club to act with ambition in the market. Gags made it clear: “I hope we are signing some great players. It would be such an exciting summer… having this great league title win and then signing players would be just amazing.”\n\nThat excitement, however, comes with structure. Grizz reinforced that Liverpool’s recruitment remains deliberate, not fan-driven. “We’re a bit too… not arrogant, confident… in our own ability to recruit without the need for players’ opinions per se.”\n\nNot Just About Quantity\n\nWhile some fans call for wholesale changes, both Gags and Grizz emphasised that smart additions are more important than flashy ones. The presence of long-term leaders means Liverpool don’t need to tear down the team — they need to reinforce it.\n\nGags suggested that forward recruitment could be one key focus: “Whoever we sign as a striker this summer… they will be signing because they want to play with [Salah].” He continued, “This is our elite, elite level forward that we can go down in history with and be proud of.”\n\nIt’s not just about attacking depth. There were also comments about midfield rotation and fitness, particularly around Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones. “Dom is probably spent… Curtis has got more legs,” Gags noted, reflecting on how squad depth may still need to be addressed.\n\nCalm Confidence in the Plan\n\nDespite social media panic, both contributors dismissed any notion of disorganisation. “I wasn’t worried or stressed out,” said Grizz. “It’s not affecting their performance, their commitment, their desire.”\n\nWith senior players showing full buy-in and the club preparing early, expectations are rising. “Let’s go for it,” said Gags. “We’re on a high — let’s make this a great one.”"}

Despite last year’s extensive rebuild—bringing in Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endo, and Ryan Gravenberch—there’s growing consensus that another creative presence could be key in taking the Reds to the next level.\n\nWhile Stefan Bajcetic is expected to return to Anfield after a productive loan spell at Las Palmas, and Curtis Jones continues to offer reliable depth, question marks linger over Liverpool’s ability to unlock low blocks and break down defensive units—especially when Szoboszlai and Mac Allister are tasked with deeper responsibilities.\n\nThis is where a familiar name has re-entered the conversation: Orkun Kokcu.\n\nKokcu Back in the Frame\n\nAs reported by Record.pt, Liverpool are once again “watching closely” as Kokcu flourishes in Portugal. The 24-year-old has notched up 11 goals and seven assists this season for Benfica and is said to be “operating at his peak”. That level of output is bound to raise eyebrows at Anfield.\n\nThe Turkish international, who captained Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title under Arne Slot in 2023, was previously on Liverpool’s radar before his £26m move to Benfica. At the time, a deal felt close, but never materialised. Still, the interest has never truly dissipated.\n\nAccording to Record.pt, Kokcu is now viewed by Slot as “one of his preferred targets” for the summer window, a significant endorsement that underlines how well the player fits the Dutchman’s system and footballing ideals.\n\nSlot Factor Could Be Decisive\n\nKokcu’s previous relationship with Arne Slot could prove critical. He is not just a talented midfielder, but a trusted on-field leader who already knows Slot’s expectations. That pre-existing bond might give Liverpool a competitive edge, even with a reported £129m release clause in place.\n\nOne quote stands out in Record.pt’s coverage: “Slot said to see Kokcu as one of his preferred targets”—a clear signal that this isn’t just idle gossip. This is a manager with a clear blueprint for his side, and Kokcu is an influential piece within it.\n\nWhile the financial outlay may appear daunting, there’s a growing belief that the Turkish international is both attainable and well-suited for a step up to Premier League competition.\n\nWhat Kokcu Would Bring to Anfield\n\nStylistically, Kokcu offers a blend of vision, work rate, and attacking output. In many ways, he could be seen as a natural upgrade to Harvey Elliott, who appears to be falling out of favour under Slot. The former Feyenoord skipper thrives in transitional play and boasts the kind of leadership credentials that could be invaluable for a young and evolving Liverpool squad.\n\nMoreover, his ability to operate as a No.8 or advanced playmaker aligns with Slot’s penchant for tactical flexibility. As Liverpool look to evolve beyond the Jurgen Klopp era, Kokcu’s arrival could represent a clear pivot towards a more controlled, possession-heavy approach.\n\n“Liverpool are once again watching closely after Kokcu delivered a strong season for Benfica,” Record.pt note—a reminder that past interest has only grown stronger with time.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor Liverpool supporters, the link to Orkun Kokcu is one that ticks multiple boxes. Not only is he a proven leader and technically gifted midfielder, but he also boasts the kind of personal relationship with Arne Slot that few other targets can claim.\n\nSlot’s desire to bring in someone familiar with his high-intensity, tactical style suggests he’s laying the groundwork for a true system-based squad. And with the likes of Gravenberch and Szoboszlai still finding consistency, adding a player who understands Slot’s demands could offer a much-needed shortcut in implementation.\n\nIt’s also refreshing to see Liverpool being proactive. Under Klopp, the club often waited for the perfect player at the perfect price. While that brought plenty of success, the modern game demands a touch more urgency and risk. Kokcu might not come cheap, but if he’s genuinely one of Slot’s “preferred targets”, the club should do everything they can to make it happen.\n\nGiven his creative numbers, leadership, and adaptability, Kokcu feels like a statement signing for a new Liverpool era. Whether he starts or rotates, it’s easy to imagine him becoming a fan favourite quickly—especially with his firebrand playing style and knack for producing big moments.\n\nFor a club in transition, this is exactly the type of deal that could stabilise the midfield while raising the squad’s ceiling. Don’t be surprised if this one gathers serious momentum in the coming weeks."}

On the Stat Me Up podcast for Anfield Index, Dave Davis and Dr Phil Barter offered a comprehensive statistical comparison of Liverpool’s current options and transfer targets. At the centre of it all: the pursuit of Dean Huijsen.\n\nThere’s no question the 20-year-old is talented, and as Barter noted, his metrics are exceptional for his age. But as the discussion revealed, Huijsen may be the future — not the present. For now, Liverpool still need Konaté.\n\nImpressive Numbers Show Huge Ceiling\n\n“You can see why all these clubs are ready to risk £50 million,” said Barter, when talking through Huijsen’s data. And there’s no exaggeration. The youngster, currently at Bournemouth, impresses across key metrics. “Progressive carries in the 91st percentile, shot-creating actions in the 94th,” Barter noted.\n\nThat kind of ball-carrying profile is rare for centre-backs — particularly ones just out of their teens. Huijsen is calm in possession, technically sound, and “has fewer defects in his game” than many defenders his age, according to Barter.\n\nIn terms of physical profile, he’s not far off the mark either. “He’s got a top speed of 33.6km/h,” said Barter, comparing it with Konaté’s 34. “It’s not a massive gap, but over 100 metres that’s about a second — and that’s significant in recovery situations.”\n\nStill a Tier Below in Experience and Physicality\n\nBut despite the praise, both Davis and Barter were cautious about rushing Huijsen into a role as a direct replacement for Konaté. “For where he is right now, [Konaté] is above Huijsen by a bit of distance,” Davis made clear.\n\nThe gap isn’t just in pace or numbers — it’s in exposure. “This is Huijsen’s first season in the Premier League,” Barter reminded listeners. Konaté, on the other hand, has played in a Champions League final, a World Cup final, and been integral to Liverpool’s strongest recent runs.\n\nBarter added: “Konaté is better in the air, better in pass completion, better in duels — and quicker. He’s the dominant centre-half. Huijsen is more progressive, but he doesn’t recycle possession as well as Konaté.”\n\nWhy Liverpool Want Both — Not One or the Other\n\nPerhaps the most telling insight was the shared view that Liverpool shouldn’t be choosing between the two. “The ideal scenario is to have both,” said Davis, and Barter echoed that sentiment. Huijsen’s potential is clear, but he’s not ready to displace an elite-level partner like Konaté.\n\nInstead, his arrival could allow Liverpool to rotate more intelligently, protect players from injury, and develop a versatile backline. “It’s not that Huijsen isn’t ready to contribute,” said Barter. “It’s that replacing Konaté outright now would be a downgrade in key areas.”\n\nAnd it’s not just about performance — it’s about ambition. Slot’s Liverpool must remain competitive on multiple fronts. “You’re probably looking to play 1,500 minutes if you came into Liverpool,” Davis said of Huijsen’s potential role. That kind of managed development suits the player and the club.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nLiverpool fans often crave a perfect balance between youth and experience — between vision for the future and stability in the now. In this case, the data supports that desire.\n\nDean Huijsen looks like a future starter. His ability to carry, his attacking contributions, and his composure in possession are all elite indicators. But for the moment, he’s a complement to Konaté, not a replacement. As Barter summarised: “Huijsen profiles well, but right now, Konaté is a level above.”"}

By the end, you’ll have actionable insights to enhance your backlink profile, improve domain authority, and drive organic traffic.\n\nUnderstanding Link Insertion: How to Analyze Its Impact\n\nLink insertions are a common link building tactic of adding a link to an existing article on another site, rather than creating new content for that site. Also called niche edits or link placements, this approach places a backlink within already published, contextually relevant content. According to BuzzStream, link insertions account for about 10% of link building activities—just behind guest posting at 13% .\n\nFrom an SEO standpoint, link insertion delivers value by leveraging existing page authority: you bypass the overhead of content creation and tap directly into an established page’s link equity. Outreach for link insertions is generally quicker and less resource‑intensive compared to guest posts, enabling you to contact twice as many sites in the same timeframe.\n\nWhen you analyze performance, track metrics such as referral traffic uplift, keyword ranking improvements, and domain authority growth. High‑visibility placements—in introductory or conclusion paragraphs—often yield stronger click‑through rates and better SEO signals than buried links.\n\nGet Started with Semrush 7 Days Free Trial\n\nKey Benefits of Link Insertion\n\nSpeed & Scalability: Minimal content creation required, faster outreach cycles\n\nContextual Relevance: Backlinks sit within topically aligned content\n\nCost‑Effectiveness: Lower writer and editorial effort compared to full article creation\n\nFor deeper insights, check out our 9 Excellent Tools for Free Image Optimization to Improve SEO on SmashingApps.\n\nExploring Guest Blog Posting: Find Why It Matters\n\nGuest blog posting involves writing and publishing a full article on another website to earn a backlink and engage a new audience. This strategy remains a staple for 60% of blogs, which publish between 1–5 guest posts per month. Despite rumors of its decline, guest blogging is very much alive—Blogger Outreach confirms that 60% of bloggers continue to use it regularly, underlining its staying power.\n\nWhen you find opportunities for guest posting, look for sites with:\n\nDomain Authority (DA) ≥ 30 Engaged audiences (e.g., comment activity, social shares) Topical alignment with your niche\n\nBeyond backlinks, guest posts build brand awareness, position you as an industry authority, and drive referral traffic. According to a SEMrush poll, 43.7% of marketers use guest posts for SEO at least occasionally.\n\nGuest Posting Advantages\n\nFull Control: You craft the content and choose anchor text\n\nAuthority Building: Showcases expertise under your byline\n\nAudience Reach: Tap into another site’s readership\n\nReady to start?

In the Rival Recon podcast on Anfield Index, host Hari Sethi was joined by Leicester supporter Becky Taylor to explore the Foxes’ disastrous campaign. The result was a candid, cathartic discussion of a club in freefall.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AnfieldIndex/status/1913230312814870765\n\nPain Foreseen But Not Like This\n\nBecky T was blunt in her admission: “I did expect it to be pretty painful — but not quite the pain that it has been this season.” Reflecting on her own words at the start of the campaign, she recalled tweeting: “Well, this is going to be an all-timer of a season.”\n\nThough the fanbase prepared for a relegation battle, early signs under Steve Cooper were deceptively encouraging. “After the first game, play Spurs, get a draw, look like we actually have a bit of fight… the hope’s back already.” But that flicker of belief soon evaporated.\n\nInjuries and inconsistent selection disrupted any momentum. “Some of the players that we’ve lost through injury this season are some real, real big players,” Becky explained, also questioning why others “have been out of favour when I’m not really sure why.”\n\nManagerial Missteps and Identity Crisis\n\nOne recurring theme was Leicester’s muddled identity under Steve Cooper. “He’s a really nice guy,” Becky said, “but doesn’t necessarily mean you’re a great football manager.” She described Cooper’s tenure as a period of “defensive setups with not very good defensive players.”\n\nShe added, “It looked like a lot of the time, they didn’t really know what the plan was.” While results under Cooper may have flattered, the performances did not. “Honestly, we were lucky to get a lot of the points that we did.”\n\nBecky summed it up harshly: “We looked lost under him. A different style of relegation, basically.”\n\nDefending the Indefensible\n\nNo aspect of Leicester’s season has come under more scrutiny than their defence. “There is a real distinct lack of quality,” Becky admitted, pointing to the now-infamous Wout Faes: “He’s one of the worst footballers I’ve seen… I’m sick of seeing him.”\n\nRecalling the game at Anfield when Faes scored two own goals, Becky noted: “That’s what everyone remembers. But unfortunately, we’ve as fans had to watch him play many, many more games and be as absolute carnage as that.”\n\nRecruitment has only deepened the crisis. Leicester spent £15 million on Coady and £25 million on Skip, both of whom have barely played. “That £40 million should have been invested so much better,” she lamented.\n\nDismay and Diminished Expectations\n\nBecky also criticised baffling contract decisions, including extending deals for players who had not proven themselves. “We gave Yannick Vestergaard a three-year contract… just kind of that constant giving players ridiculous contracts without them really justifying it.”\n\nInjuries and poor transfer strategy compounded what Becky saw as “a season of inevitability.” Yet, it wasn’t without frustration at wasted potential. “With a full squad, I think there was more quality than people give it,” she insisted.\n\nUltimately, as Leicester prepare to host a rampant Liverpool side led by Arne Slot, the gulf between the two clubs has never felt wider. While the Reds eye silverware, Leicester reflect on missteps and what might have been."}

The 26-year-old German keeper is valued at €5 million (£4 million), and while this figure is relatively modest by Premier League standards, it still raises eyebrows given the current depth available to Arne Slot.\n\n“Nicolas (contract until 2029) is clearly at the top of the list, even in the plans for the coming season,” the report states. But crucially, Bild highlight Liverpool’s interest being tied to Fabian Otte, the Reds’ current head of first-team goalkeeper coaching, who previously worked with Nicolas.\n\n“There are increasing numbers of English buyers interested in the goalkeeper, who has already been eyed by national coach Julian Nagelsmann (37), including Liverpool and former goalkeeping coach Fabian Otte (34),” it continues.\n\nInternal Movement Could Explain the Link\n\nOn the face of it, Liverpool seem well-stocked between the sticks. Alisson remains one of the world’s best shot-stoppers, and Caoimhín Kelleher has proven to be an outstanding deputy. However, there is a general understanding that Kelleher seeks first-team football elsewhere, and with Vitezslav Jaros tipped to head out on loan or be sold permanently, Liverpool’s depth may be more fragile than it seems.\n\nFurthermore, Giorgi Mamardashvili’s anticipated arrival from Valencia adds another dimension. If the Georgian becomes the No.2 or even challenges Alisson long-term, Liverpool may view Nicolas as a future No.3 or a transitional figure should any late summer deals not pan out.\n\nOtte’s influence is not to be underestimated. If a trusted coach sees Nicolas as a valuable addition, it may be a case of smart squad-building for a long and gruelling season ahead.\n\nModest Price Tag Makes Business Sense\n\nFinancially, Nicolas represents little risk. At just £4 million, he would cost less than many Premier League academy players. For a club as meticulous in recruitment as Liverpool, such a figure for a keeper reportedly admired by national team coaches is more of an opportunity than a gamble.\n\nThe report from Bild underlines Borussia Mönchengladbach’s financial needs: “A concrete offer could trigger immediate action, as Gladbach urgently needs transfer revenue.” That places Liverpool in a strong negotiating position.\n\nIt also opens up the possibility that Liverpool aren’t alone in this interest. Premier League sides such as Brentford, Nottingham Forest or even Crystal Palace – all of whom may reshuffle their squads this summer – could realistically rival the Reds for Nicolas.\n\nTactical Fit and Potential Pathway\n\nSlot is expected to implement a more flexible, possession-based system than his predecessor. That may influence the type of keeper Liverpool pursue going forward – one confident with distribution, composed under pressure, and alert in transition. Nicolas, having matured in the Bundesliga’s fast-paced environment, could fit that profile.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering Liverpool’s typical succession planning. Deals like these are rarely short-term. They usually look two or three seasons ahead. Nicolas might not be stepping into the first team in August, but this could be the first move in a reshaping of the goalkeeping roster post-Kelleher.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a Liverpool supporter’s lens, this rumoured move feels a little under-the-radar – but that’s precisely what makes it so believable. The club has a knack for scouting efficiently and backing their coaching staff’s insight, and if Fabian Otte has identified Moritz Nicolas as a viable addition, fans should sit up and take notice.\n\nIt’s not just about talent; it’s about profile and price. At €5m, Nicolas is comfortably affordable even in a summer where midfield and defensive additions are likely to take financial priority. He wouldn’t arrive expecting to dethrone Alisson, but to add competition, maturity, and possibly be an Alisson successor in the long term – especially if Mamardashvili ends up being a stepping-stone figure or is loaned out for development.\n\nThere’s also something to be said for mentality. A keeper admired by Nagelsmann is clearly doing something right. Nicolas would come in with Bundesliga pedigree and years ahead of him, and perhaps Liverpool see a window to develop him under elite coaching before he’s priced out of their bracket.\n\nWhile this won’t be the headline-grabbing transfer fans shout about, it’s the kind of move that can prove quietly important across a long season. The Champions League will return to Anfield next season, and you don’t go deep in that competition without strength in depth across the pitch – especially in goal."}

When Fabrizio Romano retweets himself, it’s not just filler for the timeline — it’s the signal. And on Friday evening, that signal couldn’t have been clearer: Darwin Nunez, Liverpool’s erratic yet enthralling forward, is on his way out.\n\nRomano’s update — “The plan is clear since February and it hasn’t changed: Darwin Nunez, expected to leave Liverpool in the summer. After offer turned down by the club in January from Al Nassr, all options will be considered in the upcoming months. Darwin, also open to new chapter.” — laid it bare.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/fabrizioromano/status/1913489239976907071\n\nThe Uruguayan’s cryptic black-and-white training photos posted earlier in the day hinted at something deeper. One shot, in particular, captured him lost in thought — and it wasn’t the first time his body language had become the subject of fan and media scrutiny.\n\nTensions, Transfers and Turning Points\n\nIt’s not hard to trace the arc. Nunez was heavily linked with a winter switch to Saudi Arabia, with Al Nassr offering around €70 million — a tempting bid Liverpool reportedly rebuffed. But now, that same move looks to be firmly back on the table as the summer looms.\n\nRomano’s February tweet, which he resuscitated this week, provided the clearest indication yet: “Darwin Nunez’s full focus until July remains on Liverpool after Al Nassr deal collapsed in January… but then he has strong chances to leave the club. Nunez’s exit in the summer is a concrete possibility, already discussed in recent months.”\n\nNew manager Arne Slot’s arrival means a fresh tactical approach, and Nunez, despite his tireless running and physical presence, has struggled to find his rhythm this term. He missed last week’s match, prompting whispers of a bust-up in training — though Slot moved quickly to quash them.\n\n“He didn’t feel himself the day before the match, and he went inside and he wasn’t able to be part of the team the day after,” Slot explained. “He did leave the pitch because he didn’t feel himself.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Darwinn99/status/1913299276588871814\n\nPromise Unfulfilled\n\nSigned under Jurgen Klopp for a hefty €75 million in 2022, Nunez was meant to be the next great No. 9. He’d torn through defences in Portugal with Benfica, but in England, it’s been a tale of flashes rather than fires.\n\nFive Premier League goals this season isn’t a return befitting the price tag — and when the advanced stats are added to the mix, the decline becomes clearer. His non-penalty expected goals plus assists per 90 minutes has dropped from 0.95 to 0.55 since last season. That kind of downturn can’t be ignored.\n\nStill, had Mohamed Salah accepted the riches of the Saudi Pro League and departed Anfield, Nunez may have been the one stepping into the vacuum. Instead, the Egyptian signed a two-year extension — and the Uruguayan’s future became that much more uncertain.\n\nDecisions Ahead\n\nWith Liverpool entering a new chapter under Slot, it’s becoming evident that Nunez might not be part of the long-term picture. There’s admiration for his raw attributes, but patience is thinning as inconsistency continues to shadow potential.\n\nWhat happens next could define his career. One final push to stake a claim at Anfield, or a big-money move elsewhere to start again? Either way, don’t bet against more cryptic posts — and don’t ignore the next Romano tweet."}

With just six league matches remaining, the Reds are within touching distance of their second Premier League title — and their 20th top-flight crown overall. What once felt like a possibility is now a very real prospect, and the title could be secured as early as this weekend depending on how the results fall.\n\nAs Arne Slot’s side continues to grind out wins, a combination of Liverpool’s relentless consistency and Arsenal’s recent stumbles has brought the finish line into view. So how exactly can Liverpool be crowned champions this weekend? Let’s break it down.\n\nArsenal’s Slip-Ups Offer Liverpool a Clear Path\n\nFor all of Mikel Arteta’s fire and fight — and his vow to battle “over my dead body” — recent results have damaged Arsenal’s chances significantly. Dropped points against Everton and Brentford have allowed Liverpool to create a buffer, and now the equation is simple: six more points and the title is theirs.\n\nLiverpool’s six remaining league games offer ample opportunity to wrap things up early, but it could all be over as soon as Sunday. The math is straightforward — and the occasion couldn’t be bigger.\n\nHow Liverpool Can Win the Title on Sunday\n\nThere’s a very specific sequence of results needed this weekend for Liverpool to clinch the title. Here’s how it works:\n\nArsenal kick off at 2pm on Sunday against Ipswich Town at Portman Road.\n\nIf Arsenal lose, and\n\nLiverpool beat Leicester City later that day at the King Power Stadium,\n\nLiverpool will be confirmed Premier League champions.\n\nIt’s a scenario that also has implications at the other end of the table. Should Leicester fail to take any points off Liverpool, they will be relegated. That means both the title and the drop could be decided in one dramatic afternoon.\n\nIf, however, Arsenal manage to draw or beat Ipswich, then Liverpool’s celebrations will have to be put on ice for at least a few more days. The pressure then shifts to next weekend, when Liverpool host Tottenham in what could still be a decisive fixture.\n\nSlot’s Side Delivering at Crucial Time\n\nMuch credit must go to Arne Slot, who has handled the pressure of a title run-in with the kind of calm authority usually reserved for more seasoned Premier League managers. Since taking over from Jürgen Klopp last summer, Slot has instilled a balance of tactical clarity and freedom that has allowed key players to flourish — and the league table reflects it.\n\nWith Trent Alexander-Arnold nearing a return, Liverpool’s options are only strengthening as the run-in continues. Slot has been coy about rushing back players, but his man-management throughout the season has been exemplary. The team’s title challenge has been built not only on individual brilliance but also collective responsibility and grit.\n\nWhat Happens if Arsenal Delay the Party?\n\nShould Arsenal bounce back and win at Ipswich, the focus then turns to the following midweek, where they face Crystal Palace. If they take six points from those two games, Liverpool will still need a win over Spurs on Sunday, April 27 to secure the title. That would make for a fitting celebration at Anfield, with fans ready to witness history once again.\n\nHowever, the Gunners’ inconsistency away from home, coupled with the pressure of chasing a near-flawless Liverpool side, suggests that the title may indeed be settled sooner rather than later.\n\nEither way, the momentum is with Liverpool. Whether it’s this weekend or next, the club seems destined to lift the Premier League trophy for the second time in five years — and fans are ready.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis weekend could be one of the most memorable of the season for Liverpool fans. With just a little help from Ipswich and a strong performance at Leicester, the title could be returning to Anfield on Sunday evening.\n\nSlot’s Reds have been everything a championship-winning team needs to be — consistent, resilient, and relentless. And now, after months of hard work, they’re on the cusp of glory.\n\nTitle within touching distance. History in sight. Liverpool’s weekend could end in celebration."}

What Huijsen’s Arrival Could Mean\n\nWhen Liverpool fans think about the future of their defence, Jarell Quansah often features as a symbol of promise. But according to Stat Me Up on Anfield Index, that perception might be shifting — and quickly. As Dave Davis and Dr Phil Barter meticulously dissected during their podcast, the emergence of Dean Huijsen as a serious target could spell the end of Quansah’s trajectory at Anfield.\n\nWhy Quansah Might Not Fit Arne Slot’s Plans\n\nFrom the outset, Davis was forthright: “Arne Slot clearly fancies one… and clearly does not fancy the other one.” Despite Quansah’s early-season involvement and academy roots, his place in the pecking order seems tenuous at best. Even during periods when Ibrahima Konaté was struggling physically, “he’s still starting and playing ahead of Jerel Kwanza,” Davis said. That’s a statement as damning as it is revealing.\n\nQuansah’s role has slowly been reduced to fourth-choice at best, behind Konaté, Van Dijk, and Joe Gomez. “Gomez actually when he was fit seemed to at times be the third centre half, Kwanza relegated to fourth,” Davis noted. That suggests faith in Quansah isn’t universally shared within the coaching setup, regardless of his homegrown appeal.\n\nHuijsen’s Profile Outshines Quansah\n\nThe comparison between Huijsen and Quansah was stark. Dr Barter ran through the data, and it didn’t favour the Englishman. “Huijsen is largely outperforming Quansah on most telemetrics,” he explained. While Quansah has some respectable defensive numbers, Huijsen’s are simply superior — especially when it comes to progression and threat.\n\n“Progressive carries being in the 91st percentile,” Barter said about Huijsen. “Shot-creating actions 94th percentile. You can see why all these clubs are ready to risk £50 million.” In contrast, Quansah is more limited in output, particularly with the ball. “He doesn’t have anything on the ball,” Barter stated bluntly. “Percentiles defensively… far off Huijsen.”\n\nEven if Quansah recycles possession well and carries it at times, the data doesn’t support him being a long-term starter at a club like Liverpool. “He does 90th percentile of shot non-penalty goals, 91st percentile for non-penalty goals in xG… but doesn’t create many shot-creating actions,” Barter added. A mixed return, at best.\n\nHomegrown, But Not Untouchable\n\nHomegrown status has often shielded fringe players from early exits, but Davis pointed out that this might not apply here. “If someone offers you £40 million for Quansah, I think you take it,” he suggested. The financial reality of modern football, combined with squad optimisation under Arne Slot, could mean Quansah’s value is highest on the market rather than the pitch.\n\nAt 22, Quansah can’t afford another season as a bit-part player. “He should be now thinking about where am I going to play my football,” Barter asserted. For a player that’s yet to truly break through at a top level, time is ticking. Especially if Liverpool secure a younger, more highly-rated replacement like Huijsen.\n\nAll Signs Point One Way\n\nBarter didn’t mince words: “Huijsen has fewer defects in his game… I could see how Huijsen could add to our ability as a team, whereas I’m not sure Quansah does.” While not dismissive of Quansah’s contributions, the underlying message was clear — in a high-functioning team system under Slot, Huijsen profiles as the better fit.\n\nIf Huijsen arrives, “it’s probably a death to Joe Gomez at the club as well,” Davis warned. But for Quansah, it seems even more final. As the summer approaches, his future hangs in the balance — and every metric discussed suggests he may not be part of Liverpool’s next chapter."}

As discussed in the Scouted Podcast on AnfieldIndex, Karl Matchett and Dave Hendrick laid bare the stakes: not only could Liverpool edge closer to a Premier League title under Arne Slot, but they could also seal Leicester’s fate with relegation.\n\nReality Check for Leicester City\n\n“This is like winning two titles,” joked Hendrick. “We get to relegate Leicester City this weekend and we get to win the Premier League next weekend.” That biting line sets the tone for what is shaping up to be a one-sided affair. Leicester’s form is abysmal. According to Hendrick, “This is one of the more embarrassing seasons anyone has had.” He noted their inability to register home goals: “Eight home games without scoring. 27 goals on the season.”\n\nLeicester’s results back up the narrative. Hendrick revealed, “In their last 17 games, they have scored six goals.” He even added, “This is actually like their second-best run of form since Rudi [van Nistelrooy] took over.” The underlying issue, Matchett believes, isn’t just poor form—it’s leadership: “This is all Leicester’s ownership’s fault. This is not Rudi’s fault.”\n\nTactical Tweaks and Team Selection\n\nDespite Trent Alexander-Arnold’s return to training, Matchett ruled out his involvement this weekend: “It comes a little bit too soon for Trent.” Instead, Conor Bradley is expected to start at right-back, with Kostas Tsimikas tipped to replace Robertson: “Kostas deserves to start after last week’s games. Robbo has been absolutely tragic.”\n\nAt centre-back, Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté will line up, but both “need to significantly up the levels,” said Hendrick. As for midfield, Matchett is in favour of continuity: “I would keep the same three… I don’t necessarily think it was down to that midfield trio… just people didn’t play well.”\n\nThere’s a case for Wataru Endo, but Hendrick conceded, “I know it won’t happen… probably the same midfield again.” In attack, Mohamed Salah and Luis Díaz are expected to start, but the third forward remains in question. “Surely it has to be Cody,” suggested Matchett. Hendrick added, “Jota has been so bad… Robertson’s performances have allowed Jota’s performances to be glossed over.”\n\nMatchett even floated a wildcard: “I’d really like to see Kaide Gordon start through the middle… if you can’t do it against Leicester, then what else is happening?”\n\nScore Predictions and Expectations\n\nLiverpool previously beat Leicester 3-1 at Anfield on Boxing Day. Matchett reminded listeners: “They did go one-nil up through Ayew, but Cody scored just before half-time, Curtis just after, and Mo wrapped it all up on 82 minutes.”\n\nLeicester, meanwhile, haven’t managed a league goal since January. “They are due to score a goal,” noted Hendrick, “and that normally means we gift them a goal.” Still, both contributors back Liverpool to cruise: Hendrick predicted 4-1, while Matchett went for a 3-0 scoreline.\n\nDespite defensive worries, Leicester’s toothless attack offers some comfort. Hendrick laid it out plainly: “They have scored six goals in 17 games. They did get five in Rudi’s first results, and that was it.”\n\nFinal Word\n\nIn a game brimming with narrative, Liverpool have the chance to inch closer to the Premier League title while simultaneously pushing Leicester towards the Championship. As Karl Matchett put it, this is a match where “about 50 minutes in it’s 1-0 to us, we’re not looking particularly good,” but in the end, Leicester’s frailties and Liverpool’s superior quality are expected to show."}

The caveat? A considerable price tag of £80 million.\n\nFor a club renowned for its calculated recruitment under the watchful eyes of Michael Edwards and now sporting director Richard Hughes, that figure represents a significant test of commitment — particularly in a summer window where numerous positions may require reinforcements.\n\nEkitike, once a PSG prospect, has rebuilt his stock in Germany and emerged as one of the Bundesliga’s most dynamic young forwards. The 21-year-old’s blend of movement, athleticism and technical flair makes him an ideal candidate for Arne Slot’s high-intensity, forward-thinking style — a system currently let down by inconsistency in the final third.\n\nMixed returns from current forwards\n\nThe need for a reliable striker is as tactical as it is practical. Diogo Jota’s goal return remains respectable, but his persistent injuries have reduced him to just over one-third of Liverpool’s available Premier League minutes this season. As Football Insider states, “Jota has been solid when he’s played. It’s just that he struggles to actually get on the pitch.”\n\nOn the other hand, Darwin Nunez has been ever-present but erratic. “He’s got the opposite problem — you never know what he’s going to do when he’s out there,” the report notes. It’s a diplomatic way of highlighting a player whose flashes of brilliance have been offset by unreliable finishing and decision-making. The signs increasingly point to Liverpool being ready to cash in on the Uruguayan.\n\nFrom Isak to Ekitike: a strategic pivot\n\nLiverpool’s original first-choice target, Alexander Isak, remains firmly in Newcastle United’s long-term plans. His valuation, reportedly “nearly double Liverpool’s transfer record”, has forced the Reds to reconsider the practicality of any potential deal. Enter Ekitike — a player once attainable at a modest fee but now valued at £80 million following a strong campaign in Frankfurt.\n\nThat price point, while steep, still represents a saving compared to Isak’s. According to Football Insider, “He’d be Liverpool’s record transfer if Frankfurt want that money guaranteed.” Yet the relative discount may prove tempting for Liverpool if they decide to go all-in on a striker with huge upside and fewer Premier League complications than most alternatives.\n\nEkitike’s readiness for the Premier League\n\nEkitike has shown flashes of elite potential during his time in Ligue 1 and now the Bundesliga. While he remains raw in some areas, the physical profile is undeniable: quick, rangy, with a knack for arriving in the right areas at the right moments. Frankfurt’s willingness to sell suggests this is less a matter of resistance and more one of negotiation. As Football Insider puts it, “If the Reds want him, he’s theirs — if they meet the asking price.”\n\nWhether Liverpool are prepared to pay that fee will depend on Slot’s tactical vision, Hughes’ assessment of value, and how the rest of the market unfolds. But what’s clear is that Ekitike would not be a mere squad addition — he’d be expected to lead the line.\n\nOur View – AnfieldIndex Analysis\n\nFor many Liverpool fans, the name Hugo Ekitike might not carry the glamour of an Isak or a Lautaro Martínez, but there’s reason to be optimistic. This is a player still only 21, already making a serious mark in one of Europe’s top leagues and showing traits that could thrive in a red shirt.\n\nWith Nunez likely heading for the exit and Jota unreliable in terms of availability, a marquee centre-forward is essential. If the club truly believe Ekitike has the potential to lead the line for years to come, then £80 million may prove to be a smart long-term investment — particularly when you consider that figure is still below what others in the market would command.\n\nFrom a fan’s perspective, the deal ticks important boxes: youth, hunger, resale value, and technical quality. Whether it’s Ekitike or another target, the worst outcome would be a repeat of the 2023/24 window — shopping late or failing to act decisively.\n\nSlot needs a striker he can trust, and the board must back him with urgency. Ekitike might not be the perfect player today, but he could become that with the right guidance. If there’s real belief in his ceiling, Liverpool would do well to move fast before others come circling."}

As reported by La Gazzetta dello Sport, the Reds have made initial enquiries about Nicolo Rovella, the 23-year-old Juventus midfielder currently on loan at Lazio.\n\nThe report outlines that Rovella, a recent debutant for the Italian national team, has emerged as a potential target for Arne Slot’s evolving squad. With Jurgen Klopp’s chapter at Anfield now closed, Slot’s reign is beginning to shape itself through strategic signings and a renewed tactical identity.\n\n“Liverpool have made enquiries for the 23-year-old defensive midfielder,” notes La Gazzetta dello Sport, pointing to Liverpool’s growing intent to secure a new ball-playing No. 6. While Ryan Gravenberch has performed admirably in that role, Slot is believed to be keen on adding further depth and composure in that area of the pitch.\n\nOpportunity Amid Juventus Financial Uncertainty\n\nWhat makes Rovella particularly interesting to Liverpool is not just his playing profile but the financial scenario surrounding him. According to the same report, Juventus are facing economic pressure and might be forced to sell Rovella immediately after Lazio make his loan permanent—“if they fail to secure Champions League qualification.”\n\nThat potential availability could see Liverpool step in quickly, especially as they look to avoid last summer’s late scramble for a holding midfielder. The situation has shades of the Reds’ opportunistic swoop for Federico Chiesa last year, where swift and decisive action brought in quality at value.\n\nThere is, however, competition. The same Gazzetta dello Sport report claims that Arsenal are also interested in Rovella. The North London club are known for their analytical approach to recruitment and could see Rovella as a long-term option alongside Declan Rice.\n\nWhy Rovella Could Fit Slot’s System\n\nSlot’s philosophy demands intelligent midfielders who are comfortable receiving under pressure, can progress the ball vertically, and break up opposition attacks. Rovella, who made his Italy debut in November, ticks many of those boxes.\n\nHe has been praised for his calmness in possession and ability to shield the back line—both qualities Liverpool need if they are to fully control games domestically and in Europe. With Wataru Endo not a long-term solution and Alexis Mac Allister arguably more effective further forward, Rovella could provide that much-needed balance.\n\n“He will also allow the creative players to operate with more freedom,” the report states, underlining Rovella’s role as a facilitator rather than a headline grabber.\n\nStrategy over Sensation in Liverpool’s Summer\n\nWhat’s clear is that Liverpool’s recruitment team is once again aiming for precision over popularity. While links to big names like Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike dominate social media, targets like Rovella show a return to the kind of efficient market work that has underpinned the club’s best windows in recent years.\n\nAt 23, Rovella offers both short-term contribution and long-term upside—exactly the kind of profile Liverpool often seeks out. It may not be the glamorous signing fans dream of, but it’s potentially a vital cog in Slot’s red machine.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a fan’s point of view, this link to Nicolo Rovella feels like one of those “under-the-radar” moves that ends up looking incredibly smart in hindsight. While he might not have the flair or name recognition of a marquee signing, there’s plenty to like about this rumour.\n\nFor starters, Rovella would be a practical signing. The midfield remains an area where we need control and discipline—two things that often went missing in the chaos of last season. Gravenberch has shown glimpses in the No. 6 role, but asking him to carry the entire defensive midfield burden seems short-sighted. Rovella would bring a calm presence, and that alone could unlock more from Trent Alexander-Arnold when he drifts into midfield, or let Mac Allister push up without worrying so much about what’s behind him.\n\nThen there’s the Juventus angle. If they’re genuinely in a bind and forced to sell after Lazio make the move permanent, Liverpool could pull off a steal—something we’ve become quite good at over the years.\n\nThis isn’t one to shout about from the rooftops just yet, but it has all the hallmarks of a very “Liverpool” signing. Not flashy, but very functional. Just how we like it."}

With just two wins needed to wrap up the league, Molby was confident—but not complacent.\n\n“They don’t score many goals, Leicester,” Molby observed. “I think it’ll be Leicester City 0-2 Liverpool.”\n\nIt’s the sort of pragmatic, quietly confident prediction that fits the tone of Liverpool’s late-season momentum under Arne Slot. The Reds, who have dropped points rarely this campaign, will approach the match knowing that any slip-up could still open the door to their rivals.\n\nLeicester’s Struggles: “A Tale of Doom”\n\nMolby was clear in his assessment of Leicester’s season: “It’s been a tale of doom.” Sitting at the bottom of the table on just 18 points, Leicester look like a club in freefall.\n\nDowney, running through their recent results, pointed out the depth of their issues: “They’ve had some dubious results… beaten by Newcastle, United, Chelsea, West Ham. It’s not been a good year in any way, shape or form.”\n\nMolby added, “They don’t have a squad that can defend. That Leicester team wasn’t built for a relegation fight—it was built to play possession football. And then they brought in Steve Cooper, a defensive manager. That was always going to be trouble.”\n\nLiverpool’s Mindset: Eyes on the Prize\n\nDespite Leicester’s form, Molby was adamant Liverpool couldn’t afford to take anything for granted. “You do fight to the end,” he said of Leicester. “It’s the most demoralising thing in the world to be relegated. For as long as you can delay it, you do.”\n\nBut he doesn’t believe Liverpool will get dragged into any chaos. “I can’t see us starting to run up four or fives,” Molby said. “I think it’ll be professional. 2-0.”\n\nDowney agreed, noting the strength of Liverpool’s mentality: “It’s a super position to be in. Two wins and it’s done. It’s all there now.”\n\nThe Bigger Picture\n\nBeyond the Leicester match itself, the tone of the podcast made it clear: Liverpool have learned from past near-misses. The emphasis from Molby was not on flair but on finishing the job.\n\n“I know you’ve said it before,” said Downey, “you feel like it’s a job that should get done.”\n\nMolby nodded to the pressures of past seasons but stressed Liverpool now have the experience to handle the run-in. Leicester might still be scrapping, but Liverpool are in control."}

Could free agents or the draft hold the solution?", "fullContent": "NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Saints have a quarterback problem.\n\nThe Saints were moving ahead with starting quarterback Derek Carr one week ago. On April 11, it was reported that Carr is dealing with a shoulder issue, a problem that wasn't publicly known until days before the team's voluntary offseason workout program started.\n\nWhen the team found out about Carr's injury is unknown, although a league source said that some of the assistant coaches were unaware of the situation before the news leaked. The injury's severity is also unclear at this point.\n\nNew Saints coach Kellen Moore initially appeared noncommittal about Carr in his opening news conference. He later publicly supported Carr in interviews conducted during the NFL scouting combine and the annual league meeting in March.\n\nThe Saints backed up that commitment by restructuring Carr's contract in early March, although league sources told ESPN that Carr was open to testing the market and looking elsewhere in the days leading up to the restructure. New Orleans has language in all of its players' contracts called the \"automatic conversion clause\" that allows the team to restructure any contract. According to the language in the contract, a refusal or failure to promptly execute the new contract would put the player in default of the contract.\n\nWhile the restructure freed up salary cap space in 2025, it also tied the Saints to Carr this year by fully guaranteeing both his $40 million base salary and $10 million roster bonus. Only a few exceptions could void those guarantees, such as an NFL suspension or club suspension for conduct detrimental, retirement or leaving the team without consent.\n\nAccording to the contract, an injury also does not void guarantees, provided it was football-related \"sustained while performing his services under this Contract\" and that it was \"promptly and fully disclosed\" to the team.\n\nNew Orleans posted a short video and photo gallery of Monday's workout, and multiple veteran players were featured, including defensive ends Cameron Jordan and Chase Young, linebacker Demario Davis and offensive lineman Erik McCoy. Carr, running back Alvin Kamara, safety Tyrann Mathieu and tight ends Taysom Hill and Foster Moreau -- both dealing with injuries -- were not among the players posted. Carr did not comment on his absence but posted a car review on his Instagram account the same day.\n\nIf Carr misses time this season, the Saints have three healthy quarterbacks on the roster: Spencer Rattler, Jake Haener and Ben DiNucci. Rattler started six games for the Saints when Carr was out with two different injuries and also replaced Haener in the second half of his lone start.\n\nHaener and Rattler were a combined 0-7 in their starts last season under former coach Dennis Allen and interim coach Darren Rizzi. The Saints now have a new head coach in Moore and almost an entirely new set of coaches, who could have their own ideas about what they want in a quarterback.\n\nThe Saints hold the ninth pick in the draft and have $27 million in available cap space, although only a few quarterbacks with starting experience remain on the market. If the Saints look outside the building, here's who is still available in free agency and who could be available on the first few days of the NFL draft, which begins on Thursday.\n\nColorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders is coming off a 2024 season in which he recorded 4,134 passing yards, 37 passing touchdowns and 41 total touchdowns. Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images\n\nFree agent options\n\nAaron Rodgers\n\nRodgers, 41, said he hasn't made any decisions about his playing future during an appearance on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on Thursday.\n\nMcAfee asked Rodgers about several teams that have quarterback needs. Rodgers confirmed he has spoken with the New York Giants, Minnesota Vikings and Pittsburgh Steelers but did not say whether he has had talks with the Saints.\n\nRodgers has 20 years of starting experience and won Super Bowl XLV, but the Saints would have to be willing to work around both his schedule and salary.\n\nIf New Orleans were to bring in Rodgers, it would have to be willing to pay both him and Carr in 2025. While the Saints have the cap space to do it, they might not want to invest significant capital in two quarterbacks who might not be long-term options.\n\nRodgers said he has told teams he will play for $10 million and hasn't made a long-term deal a requirement.\n\nRodgers, who was released by the New York Jets in the offseason, started all 17 games there last season after missing most of the 2023 season with a left Achilles injury. Rodgers threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns and had 11 interceptions in a 5-12 season.\n\n\"It certainly feels like his range ... is three to 21, and I don't like the chances of him going nine.\"@AdamSchefter on where Shedeur Sanders could land in the NFL draft 👀 pic.twitter.com/dOso3aIlhT — NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) April 17, 2025\n\nTyler Huntley\n\nHuntley, 27, started five games for the Miami Dolphins last year when starter Tua Tagovailoa missed six games due to concussions. Huntley, who was initially the third-string quarterback behind Skylar Thompson, went 2-3 in those games and passed for 829 yards, 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions.\n\nThe five-year veteran spent the first four seasons of his career with the Baltimore Ravens and has an overall record of 5-9 as a starter.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater\n\nBridgewater, 32, retired after the 2023 season but recently came out of retirement to sign with the Detroit Lions for their playoff run last season. It's unclear whether Bridgewater wants to play in 2024 or if he would go anywhere but Detroit, but he has prior experience in New Orleans, having played there as a backup in the 2018 and 2019 seasons.\n\nBridgewater started five games for the Saints in 2019 and went 5-0 in those starts. His last extensive starting experience was with the Denver Broncos in 2021, when he started 14 games and went 7-7 in those starts.\n\nCarson Wentz\n\nWentz, 32, spent the past season with the Kansas City Chiefs as a backup and hasn't been a primary starter since his 2021 season with the Indianapolis Colts. Wentz's best season was in 2017, when he went 11-2 as a starter with the Philadelphia Eagles and threw 33 touchdowns before tearing his ACL, opening the door for backup Nick Foles to win a Super Bowl that season.\n\nDraft options\n\nShedeur Sanders\n\nThere have been a lot of eyes on the possibility of Sanders going to the Saints, with Cam Ward assumed to be the first quarterback off the board.\n\nSanders, 23, is coming off a 2024 season in which he set Colorado single-season records of 4,134 passing yards, 37 passing touchdowns and 41 total touchdowns.\n\nSanders has been coached by his father, Hall of Fame player Deion Sanders, at both Jackson State and Colorado, where they both spent the past two seasons.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter recently downplayed the idea and said he doesn't believe the Saints are taking Sanders."}

There’s a big difference between giving up and starting over in the right direction. And there are three little words that can release you from your past and guide you forward to a positive new beginning. These words are: “From now on…”\n\nSo, from now on…\n\n1. Let the things you can’t control GO!\n\nMost things are only a part of your life because you keep thinking about them. Realize this. Positive things will happen in your life when you emotionally distance yourself from the negative things. So stop holding on to what hurts, and make room for what feels right. Do not let what is out of your control interfere with all the things you can control. (Read Learned Optimism.)\n\n2. Accept and embrace reality.\n\nLife is simple on the average day. Everything happens for you, not to you. Everything happens at exactly the right moment, neither too soon nor too late. For everything you lose, you gain something else; and for everything you gain, you lose something else. You don’t have to like it, but it’s just easier if you do. So pay attention to your outlook on life. You can either regret or rejoice; it’s your choice.\n\n3. Change your mind.\n\nChange is like breath — it isn’t part of the process, it is the process. In reality the only thing we can count on is change. And the first step toward positive change is to change your outlook. Prepare for the positive. Prepare for progress and the “new.” Allow the unknown to take you to fresh and unforeseen areas in yourself. Growth is impossible without change. If you cannot change your mind, you cannot change anything in your life. Sometimes all you need to do is look at things from a different perspective.\n\n4. Hold tight to the good things.\n\nWhen life’s daily struggles knock you into a pit so deep you can’t see anything but darkness, don’t waste valuable energy trying to dig your way out. Because if you hastily dig in the dark, you’re likely to head in the wrong direction and only dig the pit deeper. Instead, use what energy you have to reach out and pull something good in with you. For goodness is bright; its radiance will show you which way is up, and illuminate the correct path that will take you there. (Note: Marc and I discuss strategies for living true to these words in the Adversity & Self-Love chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)\n\n5. Rest and regroup.\n\nStrength isn’t about bearing a cross of grief or shame. Strength is about choosing your path, living with the consequences, and learning the way on the way. Sometimes you do your best and end up with a mess. When this happens don’t be discouraged. You tried your best. That’s really all you can ever do. You have not failed — you just learned what not to do. So rest, regroup, and begin again with what you now know.\n\n6. Take necessary chances.\n\nMaking a big life change or trying something new can be scary. But do you know what’s even scarier? Regret. So realize that most of your fears are much bigger in your mind than they are in reality. You’ll see this for yourself as soon as you face them, so don’t let them stop you. Live your life so that you rarely ever have to regret the chances you never took, the love you never let in, and the gifts you never gave out.\n\n7. Keep climbing.\n\nEvery person who is at the top of the mountain did not fall there from the sky. Good things come to those who work for them. You gain confidence and grow stronger by every experience in which you truly push yourself to do something you didn’t think you could do. If you are standing in that place of in-between, unable or unwilling to go backwards, but too afraid to move forward, remember that you can’t enjoy the view in the long run without being willing to climb at least a few small steps every day.\n\n8. Give yourself credit for the lessons learned.\n\nJust because you have struggled does not mean you are incapable. Every success requires some kind of worthy struggle to get there. Give yourself credit for the lessons learned and how far you have come. You’re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or even a week ago. You’re always learning and growing from your experiences. So use your disappointments and frustrations to motivate you rather than annoy you. Remember, you are in control of the way you respond to life today.\n\n9. Appreciate how every step is necessary.\n\nAlmost nothing is 100% wrong in life. We learn from nearly every step we take. Whatever you did earlier today was a necessary step to get to tomorrow. So be proud of yourself and notice your progress. Maybe you are not as good as you want to be, or as great as you one day will be; but thanks to all the lessons you’ve learned along the way, you are so much better than you used to be. (Note: “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day” is a great tool for this kind of daily self-reflection.)\n\nAfterthoughts… on Tragic Endings\n\nLet’s take a moment to address an obvious elephant in the room — the fact that the aforementioned points are infinitely easier said than done when tragedy strikes. For example, when someone you love passes away too soon, that’s undoubtedly one of the most difficult and heartbreaking endings to cope with. Although it takes a lot more time and work, the general principles for coping with this kind of tragic ending are applicable. Let’s visualize this together…\n\nImagine a person who gave meaning to your life is suddenly no longer in your life (at least not in the flesh), and you’re not the same person without them. You have to change who you are — you’re now a best friend who sits alone, a widow instead of a wife, a dad without a daughter, or a next-door neighbor to someone new. You want life to be the way it was, before death, but it never will be.\n\nMarc and I have dealt with the loss of siblings and best friends to illness, so we know from experience that when you lose someone you can’t imagine living without, your heart breaks wide open. And the bad news is you never completely get over the loss — you will never forget them. However, in a backwards way, this is also the good news.\n\nYou see, death is an ending, which is a necessary part of living. And endings are necessary for beauty too — otherwise it’s impossible to appreciate someone or something, because they are unlimited. Limits illuminate beauty, and death is the definitive limit — a reminder that you need to be aware of this beautiful person or situation, and appreciate this beautiful thing called life. Death is also a beginning, because while you’ve lost someone special, this ending, like every loss, is a moment of reinvention. Although deeply sad, their passing forces you to reinvent your life, and in this reinvention is an opportunity to experience beauty in new, unseen ways and places. And finally, of course, death is an opportunity to celebrate a person’s life, to be grateful for the priceless beauty they showed you, and to begin again in their honor.\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nYes, it’s your turn to make the best of what’s in front of you. So I hope you will have an inspired day today, that you will dream boldly and dangerously, that you will make some progress that didn’t exist before you took action, that you will love and be loved in return, and that you will find the strength to accept and grow from the troubles you can’t change. And, most importantly (because I think there should be more kindness and wisdom in this world), that you will, when you must, be wise with your decisions, and that you will always be extra kind to yourself and others.\n\nAnd please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂\n\n(Finally, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week.)"}

While it doesn’t introduce major new features, this update focuses on performance improvements, bug fixes, and security enhancements. To ensure your iPhone operates at its best, there are five critical steps you should take after installing the update. These actions will help you optimize performance, protect your data, and maintain your preferred settings. The video below from iReviews gives us more details.\n\n1. Update Your Apps\n\nAfter upgrading to iOS 18.4.1, it’s crucial to ensure all your apps are compatible with the new operating system. Outdated apps can cause crashes, glitches, or even system instability. Follow these steps to keep your apps up to date:\n\nOpen the App Store and navigate to the Updates tab to check for available updates.\n\ntab to check for available updates. Enable automatic app updates by going to Settings > App Store > App Updates and toggling the feature on.\n\nKeeping your apps updated not only ensures compatibility but also enhances security and performance, reducing the risk of issues that could disrupt your device’s functionality.\n\n2. Check for Carrier Updates\n\nCarrier updates are often released alongside iOS updates to improve network performance and ensure compatibility with your carrier’s infrastructure. These updates can enhance call quality, data speeds, and overall connectivity. To check for a carrier update:\n\nGo to Settings > General > About .\n\n. If a carrier update is available, a prompt will appear. Follow the on-screen instructions to install it.\n\nThis quick step ensures your device communicates effectively with your carrier’s network, providing a seamless experience for calls, messaging, and internet usage.\n\n3. Review and Adjust Feature Settings\n\niOS updates often introduce new features or modify existing settings, which may not align with your preferences. For example, Siri enhancements or personalized suggestions might be enabled by default. To ensure your device operates according to your preferences:\n\nVisit Settings > Siri & Search to customize Siri’s behavior and suggestions.\n\nto customize Siri’s behavior and suggestions. Check Privacy & Security settings to confirm your data-sharing preferences remain intact.\n\nTaking a few moments to review these settings allows you to maintain control over your device’s functionality and avoid unexpected changes that could disrupt your experience.\n\n4. Monitor Your Battery Health\n\nSoftware updates can sometimes affect battery performance, particularly on older devices. After installing iOS 18.4.1, it’s wise to check your battery health to ensure your device continues to perform optimally:\n\nGo to Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging .\n\n. Review the Maximum Capacity percentage. If it’s near or below 80%, your battery may no longer hold a full charge effectively.\n\nIf your battery health is declining, consider scheduling a replacement. A healthy battery is essential for maintaining consistent performance and avoiding unexpected shutdowns.\n\n5. Enable Automatic Updates for Security\n\nKeeping your device secure is critical, and allowing automatic updates ensures you won’t miss important security patches or minor updates. To activate this feature:\n\nNavigate to Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic Updates .\n\n. Toggle the option to enable automatic downloads and installations.\n\nBy allowing this feature, you can rest assured that your device is always running the most secure version of iOS, protecting it from vulnerabilities and potential threats.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBy following these five essential steps after installing iOS 18.4.1, you can ensure your iPhone remains secure, efficient, and tailored to your needs.

From enhanced performance to refined aesthetics, this lineup promises to cater to a diverse array of user needs. Below is an in-depth exploration of the most significant changes you can expect. The video below from AppleDsign gives us more details about the iPhone 17 changes.\n\nDesign Updates: Sleeker, Lighter, and More Durable\n\nThe iPhone 17 series introduces a refined design philosophy that emphasizes both functionality and elegance. Pro models now feature a horizontal rectangular camera bump, offering a more symmetrical and ergonomic layout. This design not only enhances the device’s appearance but also improves its balance when placed on flat surfaces.\n\nA notable addition to the lineup is the iPhone 17 Air, which replaces the Plus model. At just 5.5 mm thick, it is the thinnest iPhone ever created, catering to users who prioritize portability and a lightweight feel. Despite its ultra-slim profile, the iPhone 17 Air maintains structural integrity, making it a practical choice for everyday use.\n\nMaterial upgrades further enhance the durability and aesthetic appeal of the devices.

This feature allows users to view notifications, time, and other essential information at a glance without unlocking their devices, improving convenience and accessibility.\n\nDurability also receives a substantial upgrade with the next-generation Ceramic Shield, which offers superior resistance to scratches and drops. This enhancement ensures that the iPhone 17 can withstand the rigors of daily use, whether you’re commuting, traveling, or engaging in outdoor activities.\n\nPerformance Improvements: Faster, Smarter, and More Efficient\n\nAt the core of the iPhone 17 lineup is Apple’s new A19 chip, which delivers faster processing speeds and improved energy efficiency. This ensures that all models can handle demanding tasks with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Pro models take performance a step further with the A19 Pro chip, designed specifically for power users who require top-tier capabilities.\n\nPro models also feature a RAM upgrade to 12 GB, while standard models retain 8 GB. This ensures smooth operation across a variety of tasks, from running multiple apps simultaneously to editing high-resolution videos. The inclusion of Apple’s Wi-Fi 7 chip further enhances connectivity, offering faster wireless speeds and reduced latency. This makes the iPhone 17 an ideal choice for streaming, online gaming, and other data-intensive activities.\n\nBattery and Charging: Smarter Solutions for Everyday Use\n\nApple addresses one of the most common user concerns with a more accessible battery replacement system, simplifying maintenance and extending the device’s overall lifespan. This change reflects Apple’s commitment to sustainability and user convenience.\n\nThe iPhone 17 also introduces reverse wireless charging, allowing users to power accessories such as AirPods or an Apple Watch directly from their phone. This feature is particularly beneficial for those who rely on multiple Apple devices, as it adds a layer of convenience to daily routines. Whether you’re traveling or simply on the go, this functionality ensures that your essential devices remain charged and ready for use.\n\nCamera Advancements: Redefining Mobile Photography\n\nThe iPhone 17 series takes mobile photography and videography to new heights with a range of camera improvements. All models now feature a 24 MP front-facing camera, delivering sharper selfies and clearer video calls. This upgrade ensures that users can capture high-quality images and videos in any setting.\n\nPro models are equipped with 48 MP lenses across all cameras, including telephoto, wide, and ultra-wide options. This enhancement provides unmatched detail and clarity, making it easier to capture professional-grade photos. For video enthusiasts, the Pro models introduce 8K video recording, allowing cinematic-quality footage that rivals dedicated cameras.\n\nAdditional features include a mechanical aperture, which allows users to manually adjust light settings for greater creative control. The new dual video mode enables simultaneous recording with the front and rear cameras, opening up innovative possibilities for content creation. Whether you’re a professional videographer or a casual user, these advancements make the iPhone 17 a powerful tool for capturing and sharing moments.\n\nA Comprehensive Leap in Smartphone Technology\n\nThe iPhone 17 lineup represents a significant evolution in Apple’s approach to smartphone design and functionality. With advancements in design, display, performance, battery technology, and camera capabilities, the series caters to a wide range of user preferences and needs.

The company’s stock price saw a rise of around 3% over the last quarter. This movement might have been influenced by several factors, including EA's strategic initiatives such as the release of \"Split Fiction\" and the completion of a significant share buyback. These activities likely added weight to the broader market's upward trend, which saw a 1% decline over the same period.\n\nBuy, Hold or Sell Electronic Arts? View our complete analysis and fair value estimate and you decide.\n\nNasdaqGS:EA Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Apr 2025\n\nOutshine the giants: these 26 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement.\n\nThe recent announcement of \"Star Wars Zero Company\" is expected to further strengthen Electronic Arts' (EA) position in the gaming industry, aligning with its commitment to expanding the Star Wars franchise. Such initiatives could positively impact EA's revenue and earnings forecasts by attracting more players, increasing engagement, and solidifying its market presence. EA's focus on collaborations, such as with Bit Reactor and Lucasfilm Games, may also enhance its portfolio diversity and potentially contribute to long-term revenue growth, as outlined in analysts' assumptions. The 3% rise in EA’s stock over the last quarter suggests that investors have some confidence in these developments, though the current share price of US$142.97 is close to the consensus price target of US$146.22, indicating the market may already be factoring in these future growth prospects.\n\nOver the past five years, EA achieved a total return of 28.33%, which demonstrates sustained investor confidence over the longer term. Compared to the broader market's 5.9% return in the past year, EA outperformed peers within the US market, despite underperforming the US Entertainment industry, which saw a 36.7% return. This longer-term outperformance could be attributed to EA's past strategic initiatives, though recent earnings growth has been challenging, with a 2.8% decline over the past year. The company's earnings moving forward are forecast to grow 12.7% annually, slower than the market but potentially boosted by new game releases and operational efficiencies.\n\nReview our historical performance report to gain insights into Electronic Arts' track record.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. This indicates the company is producing less profit from its investments and its total assets are decreasing. In light of that, from a first glance at Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Berhad (KLSE:KPS), we've spotted some signs that it could be struggling, so let's investigate.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Berhad:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.0044 = RM5.6m ÷ (RM1.6b - RM344m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThus, Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Berhad has an ROCE of 0.4%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Trade Distributors industry average of 11%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Berhad\n\nKLSE:KPS Return on Capital Employed April 19th 2025\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Berhad compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Berhad .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Berhad Tell Us?\n\nIn terms of Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Berhad's historical ROCE trend, it isn't fantastic. Unfortunately, returns have declined substantially over the last five years to the 0.4% we see today. In addition to that, Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Berhad is now employing 30% less capital than it was five years ago. When you see both ROCE and capital employed diminishing, it can often be a sign of a mature and shrinking business that might be in structural decline. If these underlying trends continue, we wouldn't be too optimistic going forward.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Berhad's ROCE\n\nTo see Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Berhad reducing the capital employed in the business in tandem with diminishing returns, is concerning. However the stock has delivered a 53% return to shareholders over the last five years, so investors might be expecting the trends to turn around. In any case, the current underlying trends don't bode well for long term performance so unless they reverse, we'd start looking elsewhere."}

KGaA (ETR:2HRA) will pay a dividend of €0.10 on the 30th of May. The dividend yield is 2.7% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nH&R GmbH KGaA's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. However, H&R GmbH KGaA's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 112.8% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 12% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\n\nXTRA:2HRA Historic Dividend April 19th 2025\n\nSee our latest analysis for H&R GmbH KGaA\n\nH&R GmbH KGaA's Dividend Has Lacked Consistency\n\nIt's comforting to see that H&R GmbH KGaA has been paying a dividend for a number of years now, however it has been cut at least once in that time. This suggests that the dividend might not be the most reliable. Since 2018, the dividend has gone from €0.40 total annually to €0.10. This works out to a decline of approximately 75% over that time. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nDividends have been going in the wrong direction, so we definitely want to see a different trend in the earnings per share. H&R GmbH KGaA has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 17% per annum. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.\n\nWe Really Like H&R GmbH KGaA's Dividend\n\nOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. As an example, we've identified 1 warning sign for H&R GmbH KGaA that you should be aware of before investing.

Despite the positive product-related news, the share price was likely influenced by market dynamics, as the overall market context played a substantial role in Medtronic's performance.

View our complete analysis and fair value estimate and you decide.\n\nNYSE:MDT Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Apr 2025\n\nFind companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.\n\nThe recent FDA approval for Medtronic's Simplera Sync sensor, a significant enhancement to the MiniMed 780G system, highlights Medtronic's commitment to technological advancements. While the approval has yet to translate into immediate share price growth, it aligns well with Medtronic's long-term strategy of expanding its Cardiac Ablation Solutions and other innovative platforms such as the Hugo robotic system.\n\nOver the past year, Medtronic's total return, which includes both share price and dividends, increased by 7.44%. This occurs as the company continues to focus on emerging markets like India and innovations such as the Renal Denervation technique, positioning itself for future revenue increases. Comparatively, the company matched the US Medical Equipment industry, which returned 4.5% over one year and underperformed the broader US market return of 5.9% over the same period.\n\nThe market's muted response to the FDA approval may have been influenced by current market dynamics, but the potential for higher future revenue and earnings remains. Analyst forecasts suggest revenue growth to US$38.2 billion by 2028, with earnings reaching US$6.1 billion, while Medtronic's shares trade at a discount compared to the analyst price target of US$96.83, with the current share price around 15% lower at US$82.7. If future clinical and regulatory milestones are met, the resulting revenue impact could help Medtronic achieve the forecasted growth and justify the analyst consensus price target. However, competitive pressures and regulatory dynamics remain variables to monitor closely.\n\nExamine Medtronic's past performance report to understand how it has performed in prior years.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Using data from its latest earnings report, Greene County Bancorp's payout ratio sits at 23%, an extremely comfortable number that shows that it can pay its dividend.\n\nIf the trend of the last few years continues, EPS will grow by 7.4% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues on this path, the future payout ratio could be 23% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.\n\nNasdaqCM:GCBC Historic Dividend April 19th 2025\n\nView our latest analysis for Greene County Bancorp\n\nGreene County Bancorp Has A Solid Track Record\n\nEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.18 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.36. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 7.2% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.\n\nGreene County Bancorp Could Grow Its Dividend\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Greene County Bancorp has impressed us by growing EPS at 7.4% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Greene County Bancorp's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.\n\nGreene County Bancorp Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Greene County Bancorp might even raise payments in the future. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. See if management have their own wealth at stake, by checking insider shareholdings in Greene County Bancorp stock. Is Greene County Bancorp not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

Trump’s tariff plan is working exactly as he intended.\n\nThe initially announced steep tariffs on more than 100 countries roiled markets – and sent the mainstream media into hysteria. Some of our trading partners bristled and rattled sabers with relatively small retaliatory plans.\n\nIt was all perfectly Trumpian. The President got everyone’s attention (which is almost always his first step). He then softened his stance to open negotiations. Our trading partners now realize how serious President Trump is, and they are coming to the table to figure out how they can continue to engage with the world’s largest market.\n\nThe next challenge for the White House and Republicans will be deciding what to do with the potential flood of tariff revenues.\n\nPresident Trump’s robust tariff regime will likely yield a lot of revenue. This money should be returned to the American people. There must not be any discussion of keeping tariff revenue as a new pork barrel for politicians or bureaucrats. (RELATED: NEWT GINGRICH: We Must Stop The Republican Tax Increases)\n\nThe Founding Fathers understood the power of tariffs. Specifically, they saw potential for tariffs to replace domestic taxes. The clearest explanation of this was President Thomas Jefferson in his 1805 second inaugural address. Jefferson combined fiscal frugality with a shrewd tax policy to minimize the burden on the American people:\n\n“The suppression of unnecessary offices, of useless establishments and expenses, enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes….\n\n“These covering our land with officers, and opening our doors to their intrusions, had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation which, once entered, is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively every article of produce and property.\n\n“The remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles, is paid cheerfully by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts, being collected on our seaboards and frontiers only, and incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens, it may be the pleasure and pride of an American to ask, what farmer, what mechanic, what laborer, ever sees a tax-gatherer of the United States?”\n\nNow, the world was much different in Jefferson’s time. For instance, there was no federal income tax. Jefferson’s vision of no one ever seeing a tax collector inside the United States is likely impossible. However, it reflects an ideal world of limited government and intrusion.\n\nPresident Trump is methodically and aggressively creating a new worldwide system of bilateral agreements and tariff arrangements. The revenue stream will be virtually impossible to accurately project until after the year is over.\n\nHowever, there are several ways to return the revenue to the American people.\n\nOne way would be to reduce the following year’s income tax rates based on total tariff revenue collected. If 2025 is a big year for revenue from places such as China and the European Union, then we could have significant income tax reductions for everyone in 2026.\n\nA second option would be to create a system like the Alaskan Permanent Fund Dividend. Each year, it sends checks out to eligible Alaskans reflecting the wealth created by the state’s natural resources. In 2024, the fund sent $1,702 to each of the 600,000 eligible Alaskans. It would be useful to estimate a range of revenues the new tariffs system will generate and then consider how to return it to the American people. Since some estimates indicate the tariffs could raise $2 trillion to $3 trillion over the next decade, the amount involved could be substantial.\n\nA third option would be to look at a series of tax credits based on national goals that could be expanded with tariff revenues. We could create a robust permanent research and development tax credit if 20 percent of the tariff revenue were dedicated to accelerating technology. A portion could also go toward tax credits aimed to promote small business investment, strong families, job creation, or other values.\n\nA fourth option would be to partially follow Jefferson’s model and eliminate some specific, onerous taxes with tariff income. In some cases, the cost of tax preparation is higher than the actual tax payment. Eliminating them would increase private sector growth and make filing taxes less of a burden.\n\nIn any event, Congress should start thinking now about the most effective ways to put President Trump’s tariff revenues into Americans’ pockets – and far away from Washington’s piggy bank.\n\nFor more commentary from Newt Gingrich, visit Gingrich360.com.

It runs on Fridays in the Daily Dot’s web_crawlr newsletter. If you want to get this column a day before we publish it, subscribe to web_crawlr, where you’ll get the daily scoop of internet culture delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nThe Trending team’s main character of the week? It’s the plumber of 32 years who made a recommendation that went viral. Don’t buy this particular water heater at Home Depot , he said.\n\n\n\nIt’s the most-read story at the Daily Dot this week . This is both surprising and predictable.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, we know that our readers care about Home Depot. It’s an enormous brand that is distinctly American, projecting values and peddling goods that affect most folks who live in this country. As a general rule, Home Depot content is always a must-cover for us whenever we find an original TikTok about drama at Home Depot.\n\n\n\nAnd yeah, we did not reveal in the headline of the story that the product in question was a water heater. Every good headline in the history of journalism since the dawn of the printing press is clickbait, after all.\n\n\n\nThe headline should always spark a curiosity gap that the reader must fill in by reading more of the subsequent article. Where news publishers fail readers is overpromising on the headline itself, and misdirecting readers to a flat story that doesn’t deliver on its promise. (See: Every Daily Mail and New York Post story about asteroids headed to Earth. You click but then feel preyed upon and empty inside.)\n\nIt’s the economy, stupid\n\nClever headline writing notwithstanding, why did the story resonate with our readers? Most of its traffic came from Google Discover, which is an algorithm that serves news articles to Android phones.\n\n\n\nWho has Android phones? Exactly! The dude in your life who ruins group chats with green bubbles .\n\n\n\nThe tech-minded contrarian who doesn’t want to be a slave to the iPhone industrial complex. The bored dad who works as a product manager and walks the kids to school because his job is remote.\n\n\n\nThis person may not care about being handy or tools or water heaters. But as a sad man raised on toxic masculinity, he cares about coming across like he knows what he’s doing when presented with a carburetor.\n\n\n\nI think the story also has resonance because it’s an expert opinion that stands out on the internet relative to positive reviews. As our reporting revealed, this is a 5-star product on the Home Depot website. But in recent years, the Better Business Bureau reviews have been more mixed .\n\n\n\nThe issue with this water heater, according to reviewers, is it doesn’t keep the water hot for long enough and compromises homeowners’ ability to take hot showers. One review said it stopped doing its job after a few years. Water heaters should last a decade.\n\n\n\nIt’s enough to make me spot-check the brand on mine at home.\n\n\n\nA good news story makes you do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Wuthering Waves is collaborating with Cyberpunk: Edgerunners in its first-ever IP crossover.\n\nDespite its frequent comparison to Hoyoverse's fantasy RPG Genshin Impact, Wuthering Waves has a much more sci-fi-oriented flavor, making CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk series a fitting first collaboration. But, unlike games like Fortnite, which feature crossover characters from Cyberpunk: 2077, Kuro Games is specifically partnering with Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.\n\nCD Projekt Red teamed up with the legendary animation studio Trigger to make Cyberpunk: Edgerunners for Netflix and tell a different story set in Night City. Wuthering Waves is an anime game at heart, so Edgerunners makes a lot more sense for a collaboration than the main game. Kuro Games' livestream mentioned that \"characters from Night City will step into Solaris\", so it sounds like we'll get to see Lucy and David hang out with the likes of Wuthering Waves' Zani and Wuthering Waves' Rover.\n\nWhen is the Wuthering Waves x Cyberpunk: Edgerunners collaboration?\n\nThe world of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is coming to Wuthering Waves in 2026. As we've seen with Honkai Star Rail's Fate Stay Night collaboration, these IP crossovers get announced months in advance, so we'll keep an eye out for any more information in the coming months.\n\nThat's everything we know so far about the Wuthering Waves Cyberpunk: Edgerunners collaboration.

Stealing a stamp here and there or selling a cow without permission can add up to crimes resulting in life-altering consequences.\n\nAnd so it was in February 2022 that a bus driver for Kyoto City received a banknote from a passenger for 1,000 yen (US$7), and instead of placing it in the fare collection box where it belonged, he slipped it into the pocket of his uniform. Unfortunately for him, the city’s transportation department happened to be doing a routine dashcam check and spotted him in the act of embezzling the fare.\n\nAs a result, he was dismissed and also had his taishokukin (retirement bonus) withheld. This is the money that accrues throughout one’s career with an organization and is paid out in a lump sum when they end employment either by retirement, resignation, or even dismissal unless the employee deems the reason too egregious to pay. In the case of the now 58-year-old former driver, that allowance grew to about 12 million yen ($84,000).\n\nFeeling that was far too severe a punishment for damages roughly equivalent to the price of a super-sized combo at McDonald’s, the former driver took the city to court. However, the Kyoto District Court ruled in 2023 that the city’s decision to pay was lawful.\n\nThe man then appealed that decision to the Osaka High Court, who overturned the ruling in 2024, declaring that the man deserved the retirement allowance on the grounds that the amount stolen was small and he had already compensated for it.\n\n▼ Next stop: Supreme Court\n\nKyoto City then appealed that decision, taking the matter to the Supreme Court. On 17 April, the highest court in the land overturned the ruling again. All five judges unanimously deemed the withholding of the allowance lawful because pocketing public funds was an act of “serious misconduct” that “significantly damaged the public’s trust in the bus business.”\n\nWith the matter brought to a close, the former driver is now out his retirement bonus plus around three year’s worth of legal fees which couldn’t have been cheap. Readers of the news online had mixed feelings about the case but largely felt the final decision was in the right.\n\n“He who chases two rabbits catches neither.”\n\n“Don’t the dashcams usually watch the passengers? I wonder if they were tipped off about him.”\n\n“Serves him right.”\n\n“You don’t usually see the district court getting it right and the high court screwing up.”\n\n“He has a lot of nerve demanding bonuses after getting caught stealing.”\n\n“I think this says something about how bus drivers are treated if they have to steal 1,000 yen.”\n\n“Theft is theft. It doesn’t matter how much.”\n\n“Ouch, that must sting.”\n\n“They can’t set a precedent that someone can embezzle and still get a retirement allowance.”\n\n“The [1,000 yen] he took shouldn’t matter because that’s only the amount they know about.”\n\nWith what we know, it would be impossible to say whether this was an isolated offense or evidence of more frequent wrongdoing on the job, but whether it’s pocketing money or pouring large coffees into a small cup, it’s important to seriously consider what’s being put on the line.\n\nSource: Mainichi Shimbun, Itai News\n\nFeatured image: Pakutaso\n\nInsert image: Pakutaso\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

The Hotel New Otani, Okura Tokyo, and Hyatt Regency Tokyo would also make the list, as they’re all long-established hotels providers of accommodation for travelers craving class and comfort while staying in the city center.\n\nBut it turs out there’s something less appealing that those hotels have in common too, which is that they’ve been warned by Japan’s Fair Trade Commission that something they’d been doing for a very long time could be considered a price-fixing antitrust violation.\n\nThe Fair Trade Commission has discovered that representatives from 15 Tokyo hotels with different ownerships had been regularly meeting on a monthly basis to exchange information including their respective hotel occupancy rates, average room fees charged, and projections regarding future pricing changes. Referred to by the hotels as “FR (front reservation) meetings,” the practice had been going on for decades, the Fair Trade Commission discovered.\n\nThe Fair Trade Commission’s investigation has not found any concrete evidence of outright collusion, such as the hotels collectively agreeing to raise prices simultaneously to orchestrate a shortage of lower-priced alternatives. However, the investigators believe it is possible that the insider information provided at the meetings regarding competitors’ current and projected business conditions could have influenced pricing decisions at other hotels, and that the meetings could possibly be construed as the members forming a price-fixing cartel. The hotels have been warned to cease the practice, and have done so.\n\nThe complete list of hotels to receive the warning consists of the Imperial Hotel, Hotel New Otani, Okura Tokyo, Hyatt Regency Tokyo, Hotel Metropolitan, Keio Plaza Hotel, Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel, Hotel Chinzanzo Tokyo, Asakusa View Hotel, Palace Hotel Tokyo, Royal Park Hotel, Dai Ichi Hotel Tokyo, Prince Park Tower Tokyo, Grand Nikko Hotel Daiba, and Sheraton Miyako Hotel Tokyo.\n\nFor their part, the hotels claim that there was no collusive intent behind the meetings. “Although the actions pointed out [by the Fair Trade Commission] were not done with the intent of unfairly restricting [competition], we will continue to fully cooperate with the investigation,” said a spokesperson for the Imperial Hotel, which says it voluntarily withdrew from the monthly meetings last August after it was determined that they could constitute a violation of antitrust laws. A representative for the Hyatt, which stopped attending the meetings last September, said “Our purpose in attending the meetings was not to obtain information to be used in setting our prices, but to learn about the overall state of operations at other companies’ hotels, such as the ratio of smoking and non-smoking rooms or the introduction of cleaning robots.”\n\nConsidering, though, that the meetings were called “forward reservation meetings,” not “smoking meetings” or “robot meetings,” it seems obvious that data about reservations, such as the number and prices of room bookings, was seen by members as the key information that was to be exchanged. With the negative effects the pandemic had on travel now completely over and Japan in the middle of its largest travel boom ever (there were 650 million nights of hotel stays in Japan last year, the largest number in the country’s history), and hotel prices continuing to rise higher and higher, price-fixing isn’t going to be viewed with much sympathy, and hopefully ending the meetings will help keep competition honest and prices for travelers fair.\n\nSource: NHK News Web, Yomiuri Shimbun via Livedoor News\n\nTop image: Pakutaso\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

This is one of the first e-paper monitors with a tremendous 60 MHZ refresh rate, making it ideal for web browsing, programming, writing, and productivity tasks. It has a front-lit display and a touchscreen for use day or night.\n\nThe Dasung Paperlike 103 features a 10.3-inch E INK screen with a resolution of 1872×1404, and the display’s 4:3 aspect ratio makes it well-suited for various tasks. The company’s proprietary Auto-Clear technology ensures a fast, clean display devoid of the remnants of ghosting. The dual-tone front light system onboard lets you adjust the warm or cool effects. Depending on the external lighting conditions, you can opt for a mixed setting for the best viewing experience. Several physical buttons are on the left bezel, allowing for a host of functionality. That includes adjusting the contrast, brightness, and other effects. A Type-C port also connects to a PC, tablet, or smartphone. The capacitive touch display supports pinch-to-zoom functionality.\n\nThe portable monitor is 239 x 195 x 5mm in dimensions. It boasts an ergonomic design where a portion is thicker than the rest. With most of the weight concentrated in the thicker portion, handling the device like a tablet is easy. Otherwise, the thicker bottom portion makes the device extremely stable when placed in an upright position as a monitor. The CNC-crafted body made of aluminum alloy imparts excellent strength and durability.\n\nThe monitor can be purchased from the Dasung website for $349.99, which is a solid price.\n\n\n\nMichael Kozlowski Michael Kozlowski is the editor-in-chief at Good e-Reader and has written about audiobooks and e-readers for the past fifteen years. Newspapers and websites such as the CBC, CNET, Engadget, Huffington Post and the New York Times have picked up his articles. He Lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}

Given that stock prices are usually driven by a company’s fundamentals over the long term, which in this case look pretty weak, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators. Particularly, we will be paying attention to IPH's ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nOur free stock report includes 1 warning sign investors should be aware of before investing in IPH. Read for free now.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for IPH is:\n\n9.9% = AU$77m ÷ AU$776m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.10 in profit.\n\nSee our latest analysis for IPH\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nIPH's Earnings Growth And 9.9% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, IPH's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. We can see that IPH has grown at a five year net income growth average rate of 4.9%, which is a bit on the lower side. Bear in mind, the company's ROE is not very high . So this could also be one of the reasons behind the company's low growth in earnings.\n\nNext, on comparing IPH's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 4.9% over the last few years.\n\nASX:IPH Past Earnings Growth April 19th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline).

See the full list for free.\n\nA look at the shareholders of Imdex Limited (ASX:IMD) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 71% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Imdex.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Imdex\n\nASX:IMD Ownership Breakdown April 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Imdex?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Imdex does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Imdex's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nASX:IMD Earnings and Revenue Growth April 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Imdex. L1 Capital Pty. Limited is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. FMR LLC is the second largest shareholder owning 9.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.9% of the company stock.\n\nOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."}

(NASDAQ:SAMG) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 59% of the company", "fullContent": "Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Our data indicates that hedge funds own 9.9% of Silvercrest Asset Management Group. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. Long Path Partners, LP is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.9% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.6% and 6.1% of the stock.\n\nWe can see that Silvercrest Asset Management Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Silvercrest Asset Management Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Silvercrest Asset Management Group.\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nEvery investor in Silvercrest Asset Management Group Inc. ( NASDAQ:SAMG ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 59% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nStory Continues\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There is some analyst coverage of the stock, but it could still become more well known, with time.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Silvercrest Asset Management Group\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nWe can report that insiders do own shares in Silvercrest Asset Management Group Inc.. In their own names, insiders own US$7.9m worth of stock in the US$202m company. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Silvercrest Asset Management Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

(AMS:HEIO) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend", "fullContent": "Heineken Holding N.V. (AMS:HEIO) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in three days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is two business days before the record date, which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Heineken Holding's shares on or after the 23rd of April will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of May.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be €1.17 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of €1.86 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Heineken Holding has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current stock price of €67.80. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Heineken Holding can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Heineken Holding paid out 106% of its earnings, which is more than we're comfortable with, unless there are mitigating circumstances. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 39% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.\n\nIt's good to see that while Heineken Holding's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. If executives were to continue paying more in dividends than the company reported in profits, we'd view this as a warning sign. Extraordinarily few companies are capable of persistently paying a dividend that is greater than their profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Heineken Holding\n\nClick here to see how much of its profit Heineken Holding paid out over the last 12 months.\n\nENXTAM:HEIO Historic Dividend April 19th 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're discomforted by Heineken Holding's 14% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls."}

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study Mondelez International's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mondelez International is:\n\n17% = US$4.6b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.17 in profit.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Mondelez International\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nMondelez International's Earnings Growth And 17% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Mondelez International seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 9.7%. Despite this, Mondelez International's five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 3.4%. This is generally not the case as when a company has a high rate of return it should usually also have a high earnings growth rate. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.\n\nWe then compared Mondelez International's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 11% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning."}

The dividend yield of 4.0% is still a nice boost to shareholder returns, despite the cut.\n\nWhile the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Northern Technologies International's stock price has reduced by 46% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nEstimates Indicate Northern Technologies International's Could Struggle to Maintain Dividend Payments In The Future\n\nWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Before making this announcement, Northern Technologies International was earning enough to cover the dividend, but it wasn't generating any free cash flows. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.\n\nEPS is set to fall by 68.2% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 190%, which is definitely a bit high to be sustainable going forward.\n\nNasdaqGM:NTIC Historic Dividend April 19th 2025\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Northern Technologies International\n\nNorthern Technologies International's Dividend Has Lacked Consistency\n\nIt's comforting to see that Northern Technologies International has been paying a dividend for a number of years now, however it has been cut at least once in that time. Due to this, we are a little bit cautious about the dividend consistency over a full economic cycle. The annual payment during the last 7 years was $0.20 in 2018, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.28. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 4.9% per annum over that time. Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.\n\nNorthern Technologies International May Find It Hard To Grow The Dividend\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Unfortunately, Northern Technologies International's earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year."}

In the blink of an eye, we are now in yet another cycle of searching for new apps for both Android and iOS devices we think are worth having on your smartphone or tablet. These range from games to productivity apps and, oftentimes, arrive in the form of useful utility apps.\n\nEvery week, we present a diverse array of articles centered around apps. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, we showcase the finest free apps available that week. Typically, these are premium apps and games offered at no charge for a limited time. In our Top 5 Apps of the Week segment, we take a different approach and concentrate on the standout apps that have impressed us. We personally download and evaluate each of these selections, ensuring that our suggestions are not only credible but also engaging for our audience.\n\nI am sure you are champing at the bit to find out our specially composed list!\n\nBlack Mirror: Thronglets (Android & iOS)\n\nWhat is ​Black Mirror: Thronglets all about? Basically, it is a tie-in to the Season 7 episode “Plaything” of the Netflix series Black Mirror, bringing together a unique blend of life simulation and psychological exploration.​\n\nThe game works this way: you hatch a single, yellow, antennaed creature known as a Thronglet. It might feel like a Tamagotchi at first, since you need to feed, clean, and entertain your Thronglet to keep it happy. Over time, your Thronglets multiply, and the responsibilities escalate. From there, learn how to manage a growing society to address various needs such as housing, work-life balance, and environmental concerns.\n\nThe storytelling is innovative in nature and certainly does the same work as the series, provoking your thoughts on levels you never knew existed. It is certainly 'sincere' in a sense, and had me hooked for minutes on end, requiring something important to tear me away from it. However, if you are looking for replayability, then this is not the right cup of tea for you.\n\nPrice: Netflix subscription required / Advertising: None / In-app purchases: None / Account required: Yes (Netflix subscription required)\n\nDownload Black Mirror: Thronglets from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nOverall, fans of Black Mirror will find Thronglets to successfully extend the series' exploration of technology and human behavior via the form of an interactive medium. I like how it combines life simulation mechanics with psychological and ethical dilemmas to develop a compelling experience for fans of the series and newcomers alike. The game is not lengthy in any sense, but it sure is impactful.\n\nAffiliate offer Nothing Phone (3a)\n\nMageTrain (Android & iOS)\n\n​MageTrain is a rather interesting mobile game that delivers a unique blend of classic Snake mechanics with roguelike elements. In other words, I found it to be a fresh and engaging experience. Basically, I control a growing line of auto-attacking heroes as I navigate through procedurally generated arenas that are replete with waves of enemies.\n\nThere are nine distinct heroes to choose from, where each possess unique abilities that are influenced by their position in the train. Needless to say, you will need to strategically place these heroes, so their skills can synergize to overcome increasingly challenging foes. Other collectible items while playing include gold and power-ups, which can be used to upgrade abilities and unlock new characters.\n\nWith eight different dungeons to go through, with each presenting its own set of challenges and requiring adaptive strategies to conquer, there is a degree of replayability since no two experiences are the same.​ Unfortunately, I felt the lack of persistent upgrades between runs can make progress feel stagnant, since I have to start from scratch each time with only unlocked heroes available.\n\nPrice: Free / Ads: None / In-app purchases: Yes ($0.99) / Account required: No\n\nDownload MageTrain from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nOverall, MageTrain delivers an inventive and challenging experience that combines nostalgic gameplay with modern roguelike elements. It could be more polished in terms of its progression system and difficulty balancing, but is still worth checking out if you want something different in terms of mobile gaming.\n\nEarthHero: Climate Change (Android & iOS)\n\nWhat is your take on global warming? If you think that we are not going to make it past the next few human generations, chances are you would be doing your best to go green. Well, Earth Hero was specially designed to empower individuals to take meaningful action against climate change. How does it work? It combines personalized carbon tracking with a curated list of science-backed lifestyle changes for you to make.\n\nRemove your tin foil hat, as this personalized carbon footprint tracker will require you to share your lifestyle to obtain an estimate of your current carbon emissions. From there, there is a tailored plan to reduce this footprint as it tracks your progress over time. Overall, I found it easy to understand my impact on the environment via my lifestyle choices, as it motivates me to make the relevant changes. Oh, but I still can't afford to buy an EV, by the way.\n\nI like how there is a wide variety of suggested actions across categories like travel, food, energy, and advocacy. Each action will have an assigned impact score and difficulty level, so that users are guided toward choices that align with their capabilities and goals.​\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: None / In-app purchases: None / Account required: No\n\nLearn how to reduce your carbon footprint here on earth in a fun manner. / © nextpit\n\nDownload EarthHero: Climate Change from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by Earth Hero since it stood out as a practical and user-friendly tool for folks who want to make the world greener and engage with a community committed to combating climate change. After all, no one can do it alone, so to know that there is a bunch of other like-minded folks out there on the same mission makes it more exciting and encouraging.\n\nBabyWeather (Android & iOS)\n\nGoing out as a single or when you're dating is a simple affair of knowing what the weather is like and dressing appropriately. What happens when you have a baby? This is where BabyWeather comes in, an app designed to assist parents in dressing their babies appropriately based on real-time weather conditions. In other words, you get to receive personalized clothing recommendations to make daily life easier for parents and caregivers alike.\n\nI like how BabyWeather provides outfit suggestions tailored to the current temperature and perceived weather conditions. In other words, the measured temperature is often different from what it feels like, and hence, this feature helps parents make informed decisions about their baby's attire for maximum comfort whenever one leaves the warm and toasty home.\n\nEven more important is the inclusion of hourly forecasts for the next 12 hours so that one can easily anticipate weather changes and plan accordingly. The app offers the option to create multiple profiles for different children, where each profile sports customizable colors and profile photos. Definitely handy for families with more than one child.​\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: None / In-app purchases: Yes ($0.99-$24.99) / Account required: Yes\n\nYou're all dressed up to go outside even in terrible weather, why not check out how baby should be dressed as well? / © nextpit\n\nDownload BabyWeather from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nI found the app to be user-friendly enough with intuitive navigation, making it easy for both new and experienced parents to use. The design is visually appealing, while the outfit suggestions are practical. You know what? It would be insane if this app were to tie in with vendors in the future so that you can order whatever missing clothing articles needed in advance.\n\nAWorld in support of Act Now (Android & iOS)\n\nDo you feel like you are one to effect a change on a global scale? If so, you might want to check out AWorld. This a free mobile app was developed in partnership with the United Nations' ActNow campaign, with the aim of guiding individuals toward more sustainable lifestyles by providing personalized insights, educational content, and community engagement opportunities.\n\nBasically, you will be able to calculate your annual CO₂ emissions and receive tailored suggestions to reduce your environmental impact. Sounds familiar? In addition, it also offers a range of daily habits, such as opting for plant-based meals or using reusable items, so that you can log your actions and see how your actions have a cumulative impact (hopefully, a positive one!).\n\nThe entire experience has been gamified to keep you engaged for a longer than normal time. Features like XP points, leaderboards, and community challenges are steps in the right direction to motivate users to remain engaged and committed to their sustainability goals. To see storytelling episodes and resources aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals make it an educational adventure as well.\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: None / In-app purchases: None / Account required: Yes\n\nHere's how you get hooked to saving the world by going green, one step at a time. / © nextpit\n\nDownload AWorld in support of Act Now from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nOf course, nothing is perfect in this world, which is why it would have been nice to see more diverse action options and deeper insights into the impact of my choices provided. Perhaps future editions or updates can incorporate composting or reducing food waste to enhance the app's comprehensiveness. Still, it is a step in the right direction, and the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.\n\nWhat do you know? We have arrived at the end of this week's list. If you stumbled upon an app or game you think is worth recommending, please let us know in the comments."}

In fact, after he announced the pause, Trump said, \"bond markets are tricky.\"\n\nHowever, the claim that Carney had orchestrated the bond sell-off alongside the European Union and Japan was not confirmed. It came from the newsletter of Dean Blundell, a staunch supporter of Carney in Canada's next federal election and a former \"shock jock.\"\n\nSnopes has contacted Blundell, asking him to explain how he came upon this story and to clarify some points from his allegations. Snopes also contacted Carney's office asking for confirmation of Blundell's claims. Lastly, we have reached out to several fixed income analysts to inquire about the plausibility of such a scheme.\n\nTen days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a pause in the sweeping reciprocal tariffs he'd imposed a week prior, rumors continued to spread that he had been forced to soften his trade stance because former central banker and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney had orchestrated a massive sale of U.S. bonds.\n\nFor example, a post on Facebook made the allegation, saying Carney had put Trump \"firmly in his place,\" and that Trump had then stopped referring to Canada as the \"51st state\" (archived):\n\nAnother post on Facebook said Carney's supposed move was a \"checkmate\" (archived):\n\nUsers also shared another post relaying the same story. A summary of story appeared on X and again on Bluesky. Further, Snopes readers searched the website seeking confirmation that Carney was behind the sell-off.\n\nThe allegations stemmed from a newsletter installment by Dean Blundell, a Canadian former radio personality whom media outlets like the Toronto Star have described as a \"shock jock\" — a radio presenter who relies on offensive words and exaggeration to build a listenership. Blundell's former radio station CFNY-FM suspended him in 2013 after one controversy too many. He then joined CJCL-AM, a sports radio station, until the station dropped his show in 2017. He has since hosted an independent podcast and launched a newsletter on Substack.\n\nAs a new federal election approached in Canada, Blundell has posted content in support of Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister in March 2025 and who, as the leader of the Liberal Party, was running against Pierre Poilièvre of the Conservative Party. Blundell's stance has also been staunchly anti-Trump and anti-Poilièvre.\n\nSnopes has yet to confirm that Carney orchestrated a U.S. Treasurys sell-off in closed-door meetings with European and Japanese leaders. We contacted Blundell to ask how he first came upon the information he relayed in his newsletter. We will update this report should he respond.\n\nBlundell asserts Carney retaliated against U.S. tariffs with bonds\n\nBundell was correct that a downturn in the U.S. Treasurys market forced Trump to pause tariffs on April 9, 2025:\n\nWhen a reporter asked what justified the pause, Trump replied: \"The bond market is very tricky.\"\n\nIndeed, after Trump announced the sweeping reciprocal tariffs on April 2, a dynamic experts have deemed \"dangerous\" took hold of U.S. security markets. Typically, a drop in stock prices correlates with an increase in bond prices as investors seek refuge in U.S. Treasurys.\n\nHowever, two days after the tariffs announcement, the price of bonds began to fall along with the price of stocks, forcing bond yields up. Synchronized sell-off events can lead investors to abandon U.S. securities. Further, the consequences of a sharp increase in bond yields can lead to an increase in borrowing costs both for the government and for businesses and households, leading to an economic downturn.\n\nCarney, an accomplished economist and the former governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, understands this mechanism. Further, Carney steered monetary policy in Canada during the Great Recession of 2008, when credit around the world nearly froze. But in his story, Blundell asserted that Carney slowly amassed U.S. Treasurys — government debt in the form of bonds — in early 2025.\n\nIt is true that Treasurys holdings jumped in February 2025, led by Canada and Japan, who acquired more long-term U.S. debt. This happened just as trading tension escalated between the U.S. and Canada. When we reached out to Blundell, we asked when Carney would have started to do this, given he only became prime minister of Canada on March 14, 2025.\n\nBlundell is also correct that other governments can hold Treasurys. For example, the U.S.' largest creditor is Japan, which held more than $1 trillion in Treasury securities in early 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. The second largest is China, with $760.8 billion. In third place is the U.K., with $740.2 billion. Canada holds $350.8 billion.\n\nHow the scheme allegedly took place\n\nIn his newsletter, Blundell alleged that, after Canada acquired more Treasurys, Carney met European Union leaders during his trip to the U.K. and France on March 17, 2025. In anticipation of higher tariffs in early April, Blundell said the prime minister and EU leaders met behind closed doors — meetings that also included Japan — and persuaded them to sell their collective holdings of U.S. Treasurys slowly but in concert once Trump announced the reciprocal tariffs.\n\nIn the first few weeks of his presidency, Trump indeed touted a significant tariff announcement in April, though he gave no details about its magnitude. However, 25% tariffs on Canadian products had been in place since March 4, 2025.\n\nAccording to Blundell, when the tariff announcement finally came, Canada, the EU and Japan were in a position to sell Treasurys and rattle Trump enough to make him remove the tariffs.\n\n\"China's still in the crosshairs—125% duties are no joke—but Canada? The EU? Japan? They're off the hit list,\" Blundell wrote. \"For now, at least. Why? Because Carney's play wasn't noise. It was power.\"\n\nIndeed, Trump lowered tariffs on the EU and Japan to 10% and paused them for 90 days. He also raised tariffs on China to 125%. However, as per the White House, tariffs on Canada were still in place — the nation was excluded from the pause in reciprocal tariffs. When Snopes reached out to Blundell, we also asked what he meant when he said Canada was \"off the hit list,\" alongside Japan and the EU. We will update this report should he respond."}

More specifically, the irritating condition of motion sickness, that makes so many of life’s joys like boat rides and virtual reality nightmares, could soon be easily remedied by listening to a rather pleasant noise.\n\nIt’s first important to understand how motion sickness works. Whenever there is a discrepancy between the motion you see with your eyes and the motion you feel with your body, your brain notices the error and causes the body to react. It’s not clear why this often results in nausea, but there is a theory that since such a discrepancy is also a symptom of poisoning, the body is attempting to reject whatever toxic substance was ingested.\n\nRegardless of the evolutionary reason, it’s something that everyone experiences to some degree. Our body detects motion through our vestibular system deep inside the ear, so a research team at Nagoya University suspects that exposure to sound could have a beneficial effect. After testing the effects of a variety of sounds on lab mice, they found that the very specific tone of 100 hertz at 85 decibels significantly improved their balance after a disorienting motion. This tone was called the Spice Sound and also tested on humans who reported improvements in their conditions in motion simulators after being exposed to the sound for only one minute.\n\n▼ Here is a 100-hertz tone. It’s a low sound though so it might not come through well on some speakers but keep your volume low at first just to be on the safe side.\n\nThe good news is that 100-hertz tones are incredibly easy to find on YouTube. The bad news is that hitting that 85-decibel sweet spot is not so easy. This is because decibels are units that don’t exactly equate to what hits our ears. For example, many seniors can’t hear a sound in the 6,000-hertz range, so even if you pump it up to 100 decibels they still aren’t going to hear it.\n\nSo, decibels undergo an A-weighting to equate how the sound might feel to an average person, in which case the Spice Sound would be 65.9 A-weighted decibels. However, this also doesn’t take into consideration the listening device, environment, and individual hearing ability, all of which can also affect perceived decibel levels and their purported effects. Still, there’s no harm in listening to the 100-hertz anyway, and you might just luck out and find some relief in it, even if it isn’t the true Spice Sound. Just remember that 85 decibels is rather loud so don’t listen to it for too long.\n\nReaders of the news were ecstatic about the news that not only was there a promise of relief from motion sickness, but one so simple and free of pharmaceuticals.\n\n“Get… out…”\n\n“Seriously?! Give them more funding!”\n\n“Is this true? I even get motion sickness on trains and can’t take long trips.”\n\n“I’ll be so happy if such a magical thing is real.”\n\n“I stopped getting motion sickness since I became an adult, but this is good to know.”\n\n“Sound is amazing. I heard 40 hertz is good against dementia too.”\n\n“I hope this reduces VR sickness too.”\n\n“Sound really is powerful. When I said ‘baldy’ to a man he got really angry. Must have something to do with the vibrations of that word…”\n\nIt’s certainly a development to get excited about and hopefully, more problems can be solved by just listening to something rather than ingesting chemicals all the time. In fact, I’m going to revisit my Merzbow albums right now and see if any of that will clear up my hay fever.\n\nSource: Nagoya University, J-Stage, Nazology, My Game News Flash\n\nFeatured image: ©SoraNews24\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?
