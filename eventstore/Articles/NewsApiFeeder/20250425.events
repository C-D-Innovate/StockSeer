Our new Robot overlords may have to wait a while before they are fast enough chase us meatbags away, but it demonstrated for us how such competitions can be used to advance the state of the art.\n\nThe week’s stand-out hacks included work on non-planar slicing to improve strength of 3D prints. It’s safe to say that the Cartesian 3D printer has matured as a device, but this work proves there’s plenty more in the world of 3D printing to be developed. Then there was a beautiful record cutting lathe project, far more than a toy and capable of producing good quality stereo recordings.\n\nMeanwhile it’s always good to see the price of parts come down, and this time it’s the turn of LIDAR sensors. There’s a Raspberry Pi project capable of astounding resolution, for a price that wouldn’t have been imaginable only recently. Finally we returned to 3D printing, with an entirely printable machine, including the motors and the hot end. It’s a triumph of printed engineering, and though it’s fair to say that you won’t be using it to print anything for yourself, we expect some of the very clever techniques in use to feature in many other projects.\n\nThe week’s cant-miss articles came from Maya Posch with a reality check for lovers of physical media, and Dan Maloney with a history of x-ray detection.

Instead, it emphasizes a single source of truth paradigm as a data foundation of observability. This approach prioritizes high-cardinality, wide-event datasets over traditional siloed telemetry, aiming to address modern system complexity more effectively.\n\nWhat is Observability 2.0 and Wide Events ​\n\nFor years, observability has relied on the three pillars of metrics, logs, and traces. These pillars spawned countless libraries, tools, and standards—including OpenTelemetry, one of the most successful cloud-native projects, which is built entirely on this paradigm. However, as systems grow in complexity, the limitations of this approach become evident.\n\nThe Downsides of Traditional Observability ​\n\nData silos : Metrics, logs, and traces are often stored separately, leading to uncorrelated, or even inconsistent, data without meticulous management.\n\n: Metrics, logs, and traces are often stored separately, leading to uncorrelated, or even inconsistent, data without meticulous management. Pre-aggregation trade-offs : Pre-aggregated metrics (counters, summaries, histograms) were originally designed to reduce storage costs and improve performance by sacrificing granularity. However, the rigid structure of time-series data limits the depth of contextual information, forcing teams to generate millions of distinct time-series to capture necessary details. Ironically, this practice now incurs exponentially higher storage and computational costs—directly contradicting the approach’s original purpose.\n\n: Pre-aggregated metrics (counters, summaries, histograms) were originally designed to reduce storage costs and improve performance by sacrificing granularity.

Adapting observability requires code changes, forcing it to align with slow software development cycles. Redundant data: Identical information is duplicated across metrics, logs, and traces, wasting storage and increasing overhead.\n\nWide Events: The Approach of Observability 2.0 ​\n\nObservability 2.0 addresses these issues by adopting wide events as its foundational data structure. Instead of precomputing metrics or structuring logs upfront, it preserves raw, high-fidelity event data as the single source of truth. This allows teams to perform exploratory analysis retroactively, deriving metrics, logs, and traces dynamically from the original dataset.\n\nBoris Tane, in his article Observability Wide Event 101, defines a wide event as a context-rich, high-dimensional, and high-cardinality record. For example, a single wide event might include:\n\njson { \" method \" : \" POST \" , \" path \" : \" /articles \" , \" service \" : \" articles \" , \" outcome \" : \" ok \" , \" status_code \" : 201 , \" duration \" : 268 , \" requestId \" : \" 8bfdf7ecdd485694 \" , \" timestamp \" : \" 2024-09-08 06:14:05.680 \" , \" message \" : \" Article created \" , \" commit_hash \" : \" 690de31f245eb4f2160643e0dbb5304179a1cdd3 \" , \" user \" : { \" id \" : \" fdc4ddd4-8b30-4ee9-83aa-abd2e59e9603 \" , \" activated \" : true, \" subscription \" : { \" id \" : \" 1aeb233c-1572-4f54-bd10-837c7d34b2d3 \" , \" trial \" : true, \" plan \" : \" free \" , \" expiration \" : \" 2024-09-16 14:16:37.980 \" , \" created \" : \" 2024-08-16 14:16:37.980 \" , \" updated \" : \" 2024-08-16 14:16:37.980 \" }, \" created \" : \" 2024-08-16 14:16:37.980 \" , \" updated \" : \" 2024-08-16 14:16:37.980 \" }, \" article \" : { \" id \" : \" f8d4d21c-f1fd-48b9-a4ce-285c263170cc \" , \" title \" : \" Test Blog Post \" , \" ownerId \" : \" fdc4ddd4-8b30-4ee9-83aa-abd2e59e9603 \" , \" published \" : false, \" created \" : \" 2024-09-08 06:14:05.460 \" , \" updated \" : \" 2024-09-08 06:14:05.460 \" }, \" db \" : { \" query \" : \" INSERT INTO articles (id, title, content, owner_id, published, created, updated) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7); \" , \" parameters \" : { \" $1 \" : \" f8d4d21c-f1fd-48b9-a4ce-285c263170cc \" , \" $2 \" : \" Test Blog Post \" , \" $3 \" : \" ****** \" , \" $4 \" : \" fdc4ddd4-8b30-4ee9-83aa-abd2e59e9603 \" , \" $5 \" : false, \" $6 \" : \" 2024-09-08 06:14:05.460 \" , \" $7 \" : \" 2024-09-08 06:14:05.460 \" } }, \" cache \" : { \" operation \" : \" write \" , \" key \" : \" f8d4d21c-f1fd-48b9-a4ce-285c263170cc \" , \" value \" : \" { \\\" article \\\" :{ \\\" id \\\" : \\\" f8d4d21c-f1fd-48b9-a4ce-285c263170cc \\\" , \\\" title \\\" : \\\" Test Blog Post \\\" ... \" }, \" headers \" : { \" accept-encoding \" : \" gzip, br \" , \" cf-connecting-ip \" : \" ***** \" , \" connection \" : \" Keep-Alive \" , \" content-length \" : \" 1963 \" , \" content-type \" : \" application/json \" , \" host \" : \" website.com \" , \" url \" : \" https://website.com/articles \" , \" user-agent \" : \" Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 \" , \" Authorization \" : \" ******** \" , \" x-forwarded-proto \" : \" https \" , \" x-real-ip \" : \" ****** \" } }\n\nWide events contain significantly more contextual data than traditional structured logs, capturing comprehensive application state details. When stored in an observability data store, these events serve as a raw dataset from which teams can compute any conventional metric post hoc. For instance:\n\nQPS (queries per second) for a specific API path.\n\nResponse rate distributions by HTTP status code.\n\nError rates filtered by user region or device type.\n\nThis process requires no code changes—metric are derived directly from the raw event data through queries, eliminating the need for pre-aggregation or prior instrumentation.\n\nFor practical implementations, see:\n\nChallenges of Observability 2.0 Adoption ​\n\nTraditional metrics and logs were designed to prioritize resource efficiency: minimizing compute and storage costs. For example, Prometheus employs a semi-key-value data model to optimize time-series storage, akin to the early NoSQL era: just as developers moved relational database workloads to Redis (counters, sorted sets, lists) for speed and simplicity, observability tools adopted pre-aggregated metrics and logs to reduce overhead.\n\nHowever, like the shift to Big Data in software engineering, the move from the \"three pillars\" to wide events reflects a growing need for raw, granular data over precomputed summaries. This transition introduces key challenges:\n\nEvent generation : Lack of mature frameworks to instrument applications and emit standardized, context-rich wide events.\n\n: Lack of mature frameworks to instrument applications and emit standardized, context-rich wide events.

Tooling integration: Leveraging existing tools (e.g., dashboards, alerts) by deriving metrics and logs retroactively from stored events, not at the application layer.\n\nWhat shapes the database for observability 2.0 ​\n\nAs Charity Majors notes in her recent blog post, observability is evolving toward a data lake model. While wide events simplify data modeling by acting as a single source of truth, they demand infrastructure designed to address the challenges outlined earlier.\n\nAdopting Observability 2.0 aims to maximize raw data utility without prohibitive complexity. While technically possible to cobble together a solution using:\n\nOLAP databases for raw event storage.\n\nPre-processing pipelines for derived metrics/traces.\n\nSeparate metric stores for dashboards.\n\nTrace stores for distributed tracing APIs.\n\nBackup systems for cold data. …this fragmented approach undermines the core promise of Observability 2.0. Instead, the paradigm demands a dedicated database optimized for its unique workload.\n\n（Figure 1: The Architecture of Observability 2.0）\n\nLet’s walk through key factors that define the database requirements for Observability 2.0:\n\nMaking good usage of commodity storage and data format ​\n\nDisaggregated architecture, cloud object storage\n\nColumnar data format for compression and performance\n\nAs demonstrated in Boris Tane’s example, a single uncompressed wide event can exceed 2KB in size. For high-throughput microservice-based applications, this introduces a multiplier effect on storage demands—especially when retaining data long-term for continuous analysis (e.g., training AI models or auditing historical trends).\n\nThe database must leverage cloud-based object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for cost efficiency and scalability. Ideally, it should automate data tiering between local and cloud storage with minimal management overhead—embodying the disaggregated compute and storage architecture, where storage scales independently of compute resources.\n\nColumnar data formats (e.g., Apache Parquet, Arrow) are critical for reducing storage costs. By storing values from the same field sequentially, they enable custom encoding (e.g., dictionary encoding, run-length encoding) to compress data at rest. Additionally, columnar formats are inherently optimized for analytical queries, as they allow efficient column pruning and vectorized processing.\n\nRealtime, scalable and elastic ​\n\nLow latency on query as well as data visibility\n\nThe ingestion rate can scale with site traffic\n\nDue to their pre-aggregated nature, traditional metrics don't scale as your traffic increases unless you spin up numerous new instances. This makes capacity planning for metrics stores more straightforward. However, with wide events serving as a single source of truth, observability data is generated per-request, meaning your observability 2.0 infrastructure must be as scalable and elastic as your application. To scale properly in modern cloud environments, databases must be designed carefully, keeping state contained within minimal scope and establishing clear separation of responsibilities for each type of node.\n\nYour data has to be ingested and query-able in realtime to fulfill the needs for realtime use-cases like dashboards and alerting.\n\nFlexible query capabilities ​\n\nThe database has to handle Observability 1.0 queries, as well as analytical queries.\n\nMetrics need to be derived from wide events, within the database.\n\nAn Observability 2.0 database must support two types of queries: routine queries (for dashboards and alerts) and exploratory queries (for ad-hoc analysis).\n\nRemoving metrics as first-class citizens does not eliminate the need for pre-aggregation: it simply shifts this responsibility from the application layer to the database. Users still require fast access to known-knowns (e.g., error rates, latency thresholds) via dashboards or alerts, which demands efficient processing of routine queries. However, this becomes challenging with high-dimensional data. To address this, the database must support:\n\nFlexible indexing strategies\n\nPre-processing capabilities\n\nIncremental computation (e.g., updating aggregates without reprocessing entire datasets)\n\nAdditionally, the database must handle exploratory analytics, which enables uncovering \"unknown unknowns\" through offline, long-term analysis. These queries are often unpredictable, spanning large datasets and extended time ranges. Ideally, the database should execute them without degrading performance for routine queries or ingestion. While users could offload this workload to a dedicated OLAP database, the added latency and cost of data duplication create friction, undermining Observability 2.0’s goal of unified, real-time insights.\n\nBackward-compatible to observability 1.0 ​\n\nWe still need Grafana dashboards\n\nWe already have robust dashboards, visualizations, and alert rules from Observability 1.0. Transitioning to wide events does not require abandoning these tools or rebuilding from scratch.\n\nA DSL like PromQL remains well-suited for time-series dashboards compared to SQL. The advantage now is that complex PromQL queries become unnecessary, thanks to the clear separation between routine queries (optimized for dashboards/alerts) and exploratory analytics. Crucially, high cardinality should no longer be a systemic limitation of the observability database.\n\nTrace views and log tailing functionality must remain accessible through the new backend. All established best practices from Observability 1.0—such as alert thresholds, dashboard conventions, and trace analysis workflows—should be preserved and enhanced, not discarded.\n\nThat's how we built GreptimeDB ​\n\nGreptimeDB is the open-source analytical observability database built for wide events and o11y 2.0 practice. We designed it to work seamlessly with modern cloud infrastructure, and provide our user efficient, one-stop and handy experience on observability data management.\n\n（Figure 2: Observability 2.0-The Greptime Way）\n\nThis logical flow chart describes key features of GreptimeDB that fits observability 2.0 data lifecycle:\n\nAccept incoming data in OpenTelemetry format\n\nBuilt-in transform engine to pre-process data\n\nHigh-throughput realtime data ingestion\n\nRealtime query API\n\nMaterialized view for data derivation\n\nRead-replicas for isolated analytical queries\n\nBuilt-in rule engine and trigger mechanisms for push-based notification\n\nObject storage for data persistence\n\nWe believe raw data based approach will transform how we use observability data and extract value from it. GreptimeDB is committed to be the open source infrastructure that helps you to archive it progressively.\n\nStart your journey with GreptimeDB today and unlock the future of observability, one event at a time.\n\nAbout Greptime ​\n\nGreptimeDB is an open-source, cloud-native database purpose-built for real-time observability.

It recognizes your voice about as well as a smartphone but without the need for an AI-powered NPU.\n\nDictation, however, can be formal such as using my voice to type an article like this or more casual like orally recapping a meeting. In certain cases, you might be tempted to drop in a swear word here and there. With the new update, you can simply opt to either “bleep” out the cussing via asterisks or else leave the profanity in in its entirety. Either way, it’s up to you.\n\nToday marks the day that Microsoft releases features like Recall, Click-to-Do, and others into the wild. To build upon that, Windows is releasing an additional feature: launching Click to Do with a Bluetooth pen. Click to Do essentially allows you to right-click and open up a menu of the most frequently used features attached to a file or app. The pen option is a bone that seems to be tossed to tablet users, as you’ll still have to select which function you want to access.

It will be removed from the Windows Store by July and will no longer be supported, the company said. In July, a new update will turn the Maps app off.\n\n“Any personal data or files you have saved, such as guided navigation or URLs to maps, won’t be removed, but they’ll no longer function in the Maps app past July 2025,” Microsoft said. The Maps app won’t come preinstalled on new PCs past the current Windows 11 24H2 release, either.\n\nMaps will still be supported within Windows, however. You’ll simply have to visit Bing’s own maps page to access them.\n\nMaps is a legacy app that was invaluable on Windows Phones, though that platform died years ago. Now, there’s no real reason to hold on to Maps, or to add those few kilobytes to the install size of Windows.\n\nMaps, whose data is credited to both TomTom and Microsoft itself, also previously agreed to change the “Gulf of Mexico” to the “Gulf of America.” So if that riles you up, you’ll be glad to see Maps go."}

(0:34)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The Jacksonville Jaguars knew early in the pre-NFL draft process that they wanted Colorado's two-way star, Travis Hunter, but general manager James Gladstone admitted he didn't think they'd be able to pull it off, knowing he'd have to trade up from No. 5 overall.\n\nSo when he called the Cleveland Browns several weeks ago to see if they'd be able to work out a deal for the Browns' No. 2 pick, his expectations of getting something done were pretty low. That changed quickly and, within a couple of weeks, the Jaguars were able to pull off one of the boldest draft moves in franchise history.\n\n\"We engaged in those conversations with the idea that, 'Hey, this is more than likely going to be a stretch,'\" Gladstone said after the Jaguars drafted Hunter on Thursday. \"'It's probably not going to be something that we'll be able to bring to life. Let's just go in with that expectation so we're not ultimately disappointed.'\n\n\"And when things began to sort of grow and accelerate over the host of those conversations, obviously you become more firm in your stance and your pursuit. And so certainly happy with the way that it unfolded.\"\n\nThe Jaguars gave up their No. 5 pick, a second-round pick (No. 36) and a fourth-round pick (No. 126) in this year's draft, as well as their 2026 first-round pick. In return they acquired the Browns' No. 2 pick, a fourth-round pick (No. 104) and a sixth-round pick (No. 200).\n\nThe Jaguars believe the price was worth paying to get Hunter, who many believed was the most talented player in the draft because of his ability to play wide receiver and defensive back, both at an NFL level.\n\n\"He's somebody who is deserving of a first-round draft pick as a wide receiver, and he is worthy of a first-round draft pick as a corner,\" Gladstone said. \"Certainly look forward to each of those elements showing themselves over the next few years while he's under his rookie contract. But yeah, we're excited about just getting him in the boat, so to speak.\"\n\nSo how will the pieces fall into place? Jaguars reporter Michael DiRocco answers the biggest questions on what to expect from Hunter in Jacksonville, plus NFL insider Dan Graziano sizes up the AFC South and analyst Seth Walder grades the trade.\n\nReceiver/cornerback Travis Hunter was selected No. 2 in the 2025 NFL draft after the Jaguars traded with the Cleveland Browns to select him. Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n\nWhy did the Jaguars get aggressive and make a blockbuster deal for Hunter?\n\nThe Jaguars considered Hunter not only the best player in the draft, but one capable of transforming the franchise, and even the sport.\n\n\"You can count however many drafts you want to [and] there are players who have the capacity to alter a game. There are players who have the capacity to alter the trajectory of a team. There are very few players who have the capacity to alter the trajectory of the sport itself,\" Gladstone said about the number of picks Jacksonville spent to move up.\n\n\"Travis, while he has a lot to still learn in our eyes, has the potential to do just that.\"\n\nGladstone, who spent nine years with the Rams' scouting department, wanted his first draft pick as the Jaguars GM to set the tone for his tenure.\n\n\"You know what, I probably got some familiarity with the '[F---] them picks' sort of process,\" he said. \"For our fans, I'll tell you, don't be scared. This is something I'm uniquely positioned to navigate.\"\n\nMoving up to get Hunter sends a significant message to the rest of the league: The Jaguars aren't going to be afraid to be bold and aggressive; in fact, that's going to be the way the franchise operates from now on. -- Michael DiRocco\n\nHow will Hunter's addition impact Trevor Lawrence and coach Liam Coen's new offense?\n\nLawrence, the Jaguars' No. 1 pick in 2021, will get a second playmaker with elite ball skills to pair with receiver Brian Thomas Jr., the Jaguars' 2024 first-rounder.\n\nThe pair potentially gives the Jaguars an explosive, downfield passing attack for the first time since the early days of the franchise, when receivers Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell combined for 13 1,000-yard seasons and helped the Jaguars make the playoffs in four consecutive seasons (1996-99). Hunter can join with Thomas to make the same kind of impact for Lawrence, who has struggled with consistency since arriving in Jacksonville.\n\nThis should also open things up in the middle of the field for tight end Brenton Strange and create more room for running backs Travis Etienne Jr. and Tank Bigsby as defenses focus on the wideouts. Coen had success last season as Tampa Bay's offensive coordinator with dynamic receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, running back Bucky Irving and tight end Cade Otton. -- DiRocco\n\nplay 1:44 Travis Hunter ready to take the NFL by storm with the Jaguars Check out the reasons Travis Hunter can be a superstar in the NFL.\n\nHow about the defensive side?\n\nIt's unclear how much Hunter will play on defense. He's going to be more involved on offense at first, and his defensive package is expected to expand as he grows more comfortable.\n\nWhen he is on the field the expectation is that he'll play outside corner opposite Tyson Campbell. Montaric Brown started 10 games there last season and 2024 third-round pick Jarrian Jones was expected to get a chance to compete at that spot, and that shouldn't change.\n\nHunter is not expected to play a full slate of snaps on defense and it will be interesting to see in what situations they'll deploy him. The obvious worry is the wear and tear he could endure in playing both ways at the NFL level, but Coen said they've already had discussions with the training, nutrition and equipment staff about ensuring Hunter is able to handle it. -- DiRocco\n\nDoes Hunter give the Jaguars a leg up in the AFC South?\n\nIt solidifies them as the top challenger to the Houston Texans, which, to be honest, they should have been already. Jacksonville gave away the division with a late-season slide in 2023 and bottomed out last year with a 4-13 record. Lawrence is working his way back from injury, but once healthy he theoretically gives Jacksonville the only quarterback in the division who can claim to be at or near C.J. Stroud's level.\n\nThe Jaguars have underachieved the past couple of years and have an unproven first-year head coach in Coen. Adding Hunter is a great move if he is what they think he is: a high-level contributor on both sides of the ball. His ability to be that would also help justify the exorbitant cost of this deal for the Jaguars. This is not a roster devoid of talent, especially if the quarterback is healthy. We just haven't seen the them deliver on it. There may be plenty of on-paper upside to the Jaguars, but it's hard to say any move gives Jacksonville a leg up in a division in which the Texans, winners of two straight AFC South titles, will still be a worthy favorite. -- Dan Graziano"}

Don’t tell anyone, but Anker-owned Eufy has a smart display coming out. Details about the portable screen have been elusive, but I got up close and personal with the device during a Eufy press event in New York this week.\n\nRoughly the size on an iPad mini, the Eufy Smart Display E10 isn’t the all-purpose display that Apple’s tablet is. Instead, it’s focused on home security, with the device capable of taking charge of your various Eufy cameras, sensors, and alarm systems.\n\nThe E10’s best feature looks to be its ability to display up to four live Eufy security camera feeds at a time on its 8-inch screen, saving you the trouble of digging out your phone to check activity around your home. A separate column lets you browse recorded video events, as well as monitor the status of your cameras and base station. I’m also told the E10 will let you arm and disarm your Eufy security system. In this respect, it’s similar to the Amazon Echo Hub, which can show live feeds from Ring security cameras and arm/disarm Ring Alarm systems.\n\nBen Patterson/Foundry\n\nThe dual-band Wi-Fi display comes with a charging dock, allowing you to place it on a counter or tabletop. There are also mounting slots in the rear for hanging the E10 on a wall, such as in the kitchen or next to your front door. In portable mode, the E10 should run for about 24 hours on its fully charged internal 5000mAh battery, according to a spec sheet. In our review of the Echo Hub, we criticized that display for not offering a battery-power option.\n\nBesides using the charging dock, you can also charge the E10 via USB-C port on the right edge of the device; right next to the USB port is a microSD memory card slot.\n\nBen Patterson/Foundry\n\nEufy is pitching the E10 smart display as an accessory for its HomeBase Professional S1, the brand’s upcoming home security base station and NVR. But according to Eufy reps at the event, the E10 connects to your Wi-Fi router rather than directly to the HomeBase, meaning it should be compatible with other Eufy base stations and devices as well.\n\nThis news story is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best home security cameras.\n\nSo, when will the Eufy E10 smart display finally go on sale? Good question. The Eufy spokespeople on hand didn’t have any details, while chatter online has it that the unit is delayed until August. Pricing also appears to be up in the air. I’ve reached out to Eufy corporate for more info."}

U.S. owners of the older Nest Learning Thermostats can get $130 off the fourth-gen Nest Learning Thermostat, while Nest customers in Canada can expect a $160 discount for that same unit.\n\nMeanwhile, European users with the soon-to-be-unsupported Nest Learning Thermostats will get half-off the Tado Smart Thermostat X – Starter Kit.\n\nGoogle said it will reach out to affected Nest users via email with the discount offers.\n\nBesides chopping support for the European version of the Nest Learning Thermostat, Google says it will exit the thermostat market in Europe altogether, as European heating systems “have a variety of hardware and software requirements that make it challenging to build for the diverse set of homes.”\n\nThe third-gen Nest Learning Thermostat and the Nest Thermostat E will continue to be sold in Europe “while current supplies last,” and both those models will continue to be supported, Google said.\n\nThe news that Google is dropping support for its oldest Nest thermostats comes barely a month after it discontinued the Nest Protect smoke detector and the Nest X Yale Lock, thus withdrawing as a manufacturer in those key smart home categories."}

Kemper, IK Multimedia will no doubt be watching…\n\nNeural DSP NanOS 2.0.0\n\n(Image credit: Neural DSP)\n\nWhen the Neural DSP Nano Cortex came out, many players – this writer included – showered it with praise, but there were a few flaws that prevented it from truly becoming the perfect compact all-in-one amp modeler and IR loader solution. Those flaws included a highly restrictive set of effects to choose from, the complete absence of overdrives, and a frustratingly fixed signal chain.\n\nAll of those issues, though, have now been addressed thanks to a free NanOS 2.0.0 update that adds 47 effects and utilities to the mix – including overdrives, reverbs, modulations, delays, EQs, compressors, wahs and more – with greater flexibility over the signal chain also now possible.\n\nGet The Pick Newsletter All the latest guitar news, interviews, lessons, reviews, deals and more, direct to your inbox! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nNot only does this update vastly expand the usability and appeal of the Nano Cortex to players, but it comfortably positions it now as arguably the best compact amp modeler currently available.\n\nThe TONEX proves to be an infinitely popular option for players, and Kemper is also still a key player (even though its own upgrades come with a price tag), but I expect the NanOS2.0.0 to shake up the status quo.\n\nHeck, even before the update, I was convinced the Nano Cortex, for all its faults, couldn’t be beat (I’ve toured with it a healthy amount this year already, having previously dabbled with the HX Stomp) but now I am totally sold.\n\nJudging by the noise online, NanOS 2.0.0 has left an impression on players, who are quite clearly becoming more receptive to the Nano Cortex platform as a result of the update. We wonder how the competition will respond…\n\nMartin Biosphere 2025\n\n(Image credit: Martin)\n\nAnother year, another Earth Day, which means another Biosphere acoustic guitar from Martin. For 2025, Martin has paid tribute to the Arctic with a Robert Goetzl-painted build that depicts two polar bears in front of a melting ice cap – a stark visualization of what's at stake.\n\nIts eco-conscious message is further reflected in the spec sheet, which features a bevy of FSC-certified woods that sees Martin double down on its dedicated to responsible material sourcing. This would have been perfect when Snow Patrol tracked Songs for Polarbears...\n\nGibson Serj Tankian Foundations Les Paul\n\n(Image credit: Gibson)\n\nTo celebrate the release of his Foundations EP, Serj Tankian has partnered with Gibson for the appropriately named Foundations Les Paul – but it's not quite as straightforward as that.\n\nSee, this isn't just a guitar release – with the Foundations Les Paul comes as part of a fully fledged \"guitar and tour experience package\", which includes a bunch of signed memorabilia and VIP tickets to a System Of A Down concert.\n\nOnly 25 packages will be made, and if you're interested in a price, you'll have to contact the Gibson Garage in Nashville, because that's the only place you'll be able to bag one from.\n\nThermion Powerbolt Series\n\n(Image credit: Thermion)\n\nThere is no shortage of pedal lineups that look to bring famed effects to the masses through affordable, no-nonsense means, and while such launches can sometimes lead to a bit of gear fatigue, the Thermion series from Spanish builder Thermion looks like a worthy entry to the market.\n\nOne of the first pedals – the PowerVibe – is most likely inspired by the Uni-Vibe, with plenty more in the offering. At €125 (approx. $140) they're reasonably priced, \"built like tanks\", and have been crafted with gigging and casual guitarists in mind.\n\nDarkglass Anagram\n\nAnagram - YouTube Watch On\n\nThe future of bass reimagined? That's exactly what the new Darkglass Anagram is claiming to be. In fact, this gadget is also claiming to be \"rewriting the boundaries of bass\", and will encourage you to rethink everything you think you know about shaping your tone.\n\nJust how is Darkglass hoping to achieve all that with its newest release, you ask? Well, the Anagram is a high-tech touchscreen multi-effects pedal optimized for bass players and packs a six-core DSP architecture that promises top notch performance.\n\nThanks to its clever machinery, it can accommodate complex and large signal paths – 24 simultaneous effects blocks can be used – and there's a bevy of connectivity options for wider rig integration.\n\nThere's also cab IRs, amp models, and a bunch of essential tools – looper and tuner included – making this quite possibly the new bass multi-effects pedal to beat.\n\nFortin Meshuggah\n\nIntroducing the Meshuggah Preamp/Distortion Pedal - YouTube Watch On\n\nIf you've ever wanted \"the roaring intensity of Meshuggah's live performance echoing through your rig\", then you are in luck, because on Tuesday Fortin released a pedal that promises to do exactly that.\n\nAt $349, the Meshuggah Pre-Amp/Distortion pedal offers the tonal power and sonic precision of the legendary metal act, with two separate channel voices and a stack of controls to help players dial it in.\n\nSolar Type VAR\n\n(Image credit: Solar)\n\nWhat's more metal than a V? Why, an asymmetric V, of course – and now Solar has opted to build on the successes of its Type V and Type X families by launching the even-more-angular Type VAR range.\n\nNot so subtly labelled \"the sickest f**kin V ever\", the VAR model carries more than a whiff of ESP and Jackson energy about it, with a larger upper point that accentuates the off-balance design. It also has a neat non-reverse headstock, and arrives in a suite of tasty colors. A worthy addition to the Solar collection indeed.\n\nENGL Fireball IR Pedal\n\n(Image credit: Engl)\n\nThe Engl Fireball is one of metal and heavy music's most heard and acclaimed amps, and in a move that looks to package that sought-after sonic spirit into a pedalboard-friendly format, the firm has unveiled the Fireball IR pedal.\n\nThe \"revolutionary\" two-channel preamp pedal has all the tone-tweaking parameters you'd expect, but throws in the added benefit of IRs through its USB-C jack\n\nIt's almost a compact take on the tech Friedman used for its own IR-loaded pedal amps, and because of its tiny dimensions – and the source material it is emulating – we don't doubt this will prove to be a hit.\n\nEVH Wolfgang WG Standard T.O.M.\n\n(Image credit: EVH)\n\nWe were promised it back at NAMM, but now the EVH Wolfgang Standard T.O.M. – a sub-$700 Wolfgang that radically shakes up model's time-tested spec sheet – has officially arrived.\n\nSwapping the Floyd Rose tremolo that has been a mainstay of the lineup for a more humble stopbar design, the Standard T.O.M. sees EVH deliver on its promise for hardtail guitars, increasing its appeal and accessibility to a wider pool of players.\n\nNot only that, it marks a bold new direction for the firm. Expect more hardtail EVH models to come..."}

(0:29)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2025 WNBA season is officially upon us. Training camps open across the league Sunday and preseason games tip off May 2.\n\nIt's a quick turnaround for rookies like Paige Bueckers, the No. 1 pick in this month's draft who helped UConn win the NCAA title three weeks ago. But it also marks a highly anticipated return for the WNBA on the heels of an eventful offseason featuring a slew of new head coaching hires, the formation of the league's latest expansion team and a host of players joining new teams in free agency.\n\nThe next few weeks will give us our first glance at how all those moves are panning out before things start to count for real when the regular season opens May 16. Between now and then, teams will cut down their rosters to 11 or 12 players; they are allowed to have 18 actively participating players at any given time during camp.\n\nESPN takes a look at the biggest questions facing each of the 13 WNBA teams heading into training camp.\n\nJump to: ATL | CHI | CON | DAL | GS |\n\nIND | LV | LA | MIN | NY | PHO | SEA | WAS\n\n2024 record: 15-25 (eighth place), lost in first round of playoffs\n\nSeason opener: at Washington (May 16, 7:30 p.m. ET, ION)\n\nProjected starting lineup: Jordin Canada, Allisha Gray, Brittney Griner, Rhyne Howard, Brionna Jones\n\nHow will the Dream play under new coach Karl Smesko? Coach Tanisha Wright was fired despite making the playoffs the past two seasons. The Dream went to the college ranks for her replacement: Smesko was successful with his emphasis on 3-point shooting in 22 seasons at Florida Gulf Coast. The Dream also brought in two elite post players in Griner (17.8 PPG, 6.6 RPG) and Jones (13.7 PPG, 5.5 RPG). How will Smesko use that kind of talent? Probably very well: Atlanta was last in the league in scoring average (77 PPG) and field goal percentage (40.8) last season, which Smesko should be able to help the Dream improve. -- Michael Voepel\n\n2024 record: 13-27 (10th)\n\nSeason opener: vs. Indiana (May 17, 1 p.m. ET, ABC)\n\nProjected starting lineup: Courtney Vandersloot, Ariel Atkins, Michaela Onyenwere, Angel Reese, Kamilla Cardoso\n\nAfter being named to the All-Rookie team last season, what kind of jumps will Reese and Cordoso make in Year 2? They proved to be a handful down low, but both of their rookie seasons were cut short due to injuries, and their absences played a part in the Sky falling short of the playoffs. Now healthy -- Reese spent January-March developing her scoring ability at Unrivaled -- both feel they are primed to take a step forward.\n\nIn drafting Hailey Van Lith with the 11th pick in this year's draft, the Sky have the potential pieces to build a versatile scoring-rebounding triple threat. And adding Courtney Vandersloot back into the mix gives them a reliable veteran ball handler and scorer. All of that should help Reese and Cardoso, whose combined growth will be crucial for Chicago to have a strong season. -- Kendra Andrews\n\n2024 record: 28-12 (third place); lost in semifinals\n\nSeason opener: vs. Washington on May 18 (1 p.m. ET)\n\nProjected starting lineup: Lindsay Allen, Marina Mabrey, Diamond DeShields, Tina Charles, Olivia Nelson-Ododa\n\nHow quickly will the Sun's new identity forge in camp, and what will it look like? After losing coach Stephanie White to the Fever and all five 2024 starters in offseason trades/free agency, Connecticut is essentially starting from scratch with a new coach (Rachid Meziane) and new players, aside from Mabrey and Nelson-Ododa. How will these pieces -- almost all of whom were acquired after Meziane's hiring -- pair with his intended style of play?\n\nWhile Connecticut brought in veterans such as Charles and DeShields, the Sun's influx of young talent (including first-round picks Jacy Sheldon, Leïla Lacan, Aneesah Morrow and Saniya Rivers) suggests they have an eye toward building for the future. That's something to keep in mind as the franchise dwindles down its roster and once the season gets underway. -- Alexa Philippou\n\n2024 record: 9-31 (lottery)\n\nSeason opener: vs. Minnesota (May 16, 7:30 p.m. ET, ION)\n\nProjected starting lineup: Paige Bueckers, Arike Ogunbowale, DiJonai Carrington, NaLyssa Smith, Teaira McCowan\n\nPlay Fantasy Women's Basketball Fantasy Women's Basketball is now open! Create or join a league today to get started. • Sign up for free!\n\nHow will Bueckers and Ogunbowale fit together in the Dallas backcourt? Point guard has been a revolving spot for the Wings since they traded Marina Mabrey to Chicago. Dallas has seen a pair of first-round picks (Veronica Burton and Jacy Sheldon) come and go while also starting journeywoman Crystal Dangerfield and international veteran Sevgi Uzun. The No. 1 pick should solve that problem long-term, particularly because her ability to play off the ball (42% career 3-point shooting in college) fits well with Ogunbowale's ability to create.\n\nStill, we saw the learning curve last season for Caitlin Clark and Kelsey Mitchell in Indiana. The sooner Bueckers and Ogunbowale can integrate their games, the better the Wings' chances of returning to the playoffs. -- Kevin Pelton\n\nSeason opener: vs. Los Angeles (May 16, 10 p.m. ET, ION)\n\nProjected starting lineup: Julie Vanloo, Tiffany Hayes, Kayla Thornton, Monique Billings, Temi Fagbenle\n\nWhat will be the Valkyries' identity in their inaugural season? Just days before selecting Juste Jocyte, Shyanne Sellers and Kaitlyn Chen in the draft, general manager Ohemaa Nyanin said she wasn't concerned about selecting the face of the franchise through the draft and believes that person will emerge through camp -- but how do they want to define who they are? Coach Natalie Nakase has said she wants to build a team that has a competitive fire and strong work ethic, and stylistically plays with pace and ball movement.\n\nNakase has spoken highly about Kate Martin's voice -- the two worked together in Las Vegas in 2024 before coming to Golden State -- so perhaps the second-year guard will be the one Nakase looks to for setting the tone. The rest of Golden State's roster is made up of veteran role players, including Tiffany Hayes, the 2024 Sixth Woman of the Year. How everything and everyone molds together will be the main focus for the Valkyries camp. -- Andrews\n\n2024 record: 20-20 (sixth), lost in first round\n\nSeason opener: vs. Chicago (May 17, 3 p.m. ET, ABC)\n\nProjected starting lineup: DeWanna Bonner, Aliyah Boston, Caitlin Clark, Natasha Howard, Kelsey Mitchell\n\nAre the Fever championship contenders? They've gotten closer. With a new brain trust -- including coach Stephanie White back in Indiana -- and big offseason pickups, the Fever are set up to build on last year's return to the playoffs. Bonner and Howard are former WNBA champions who bring a huge amount of experience. Sophie Cunningham is another perimeter scoring threat. Clark and Boston, the last two WNBA Rookie of the Year award winners, clicked well last season with each other and veteran guard Mitchell and should be even better in 2025. A championship is an exceedingly high expectation, but sticking around for a while in the playoffs is not. -- Voepel\n\n2024 record: 27-13 (fourth), lost in semifinals\n\nSeason opener: at New York (May 17, 1 p.m. ET, ABC)\n\nProjected starting lineup: Chelsea Gray, Jewell Loyd, Kiah Stokes, A'ja Wilson, Jackie Young\n\nHow will Loyd fit in with Las Vegas? The Aces' WNBA titles in 2022 and 2023 were fueled by the chemistry between the foursome of Gray, Wilson, Young and Kelsey Plum. With Plum now in Los Angeles, Loyd steps into that role. Loyd was the No. 1 draft pick in 2015, Plum in 2017; both are also past Olympians. For their careers, Loyd has averaged 16.9 PPG in 10 seasons with Seattle, and Plum 14.3 in seven with San Antonio/Las Vegas.\n\nWilson is coming off her third MVP season. But the Aces also have lost a lot of veteran experience with Alysha Clark (Seattle), Sydney Colson (Indiana) and Tiffany Hayes (Golden State) moving on. -- Voepel\n\n2024 record: 8-32 (12th)\n\nSeason opener: vs. Golden State (May 16, 10 p.m. ET, ION)\n\nProjected starting lineup: Kelsey Plum, Rickea Jackson, Dearica Hamby, Odyssey Sims, Azura Stevens"}

Well, duh", "fullContent": "To me, the biggest surprise of Intel’s earnings call wasn’t that Intel is selling out of its older chips. It’s that people are finally paying attention.\n\nFor years, the mantra in the tech world has been, buy the latest and greatest. The newer, the better. And for some companies, like AMD and Qualcomm, that’s been true.\n\nNot anymore. Intel told Wall Street analysts Thursday that it’s selling out of its “Raptor Lake” processors and that the process technology they’re built upon, Intel 7, is constrained. Put another way, Intel chief financial officer David Zinsner told analysts that Intel is selling more of its years-old 12th- and 13th-gen Raptor Lake (and Raptor Lake Refresh) chips than Lunar Lake.\n\nThat’s embarrassing, to be sure. But it caps off years of struggles, which some might say date back to Intel’s inability to move off of the 14nm node for several generations. Is it any surprise that Intel’s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, believes that Intel’s organizational structure is bloated?\n\nMaybe, but to most people in technology, the answer is simple: if you deliver processors that don’t improve over their predecessors, why should you expect customers to buy your newest and most expensive chips? Instead, they’ll turn to your older, cheaper processors. And that’s what Intel says is happening — especially with the tariff typhoon blowing hard.\n\nImgflip.com\n\n(We don’t exactly know if Intel executives were referring to PC makers or consumers themselves. And we don’t know whether consumers are buying Raptor Lake desktop chips or mobile processors, though comparing them to Lunar Lake implies the latter.)\n\nWhat we do know is that Intel’s own latest Core processors don’t meaningfully surpass Intel’s older chips in performance and, in certain benchmarks, they actually fall short. Just step through our Arrow Lake (Core Ultra 9 285K) review for yourself: In Cyberpunk: 2077, for example, the older Core i9-14900K produced 166 frames per second. The much newer Core Ultra 9 285K? 161 frames per second. Yes, there were power problems and later a performance patch, but that didn’t fix Intel’s reputation.\n\nIf games matter, then this is a pretty damning slide for Arrow Lake. Adam Patrick Murray & Will Smith / PCWorld\n\nOf course, if you confine the discussion to laptops, the comparison gets ludicrous quickly — there is absolutely no way a Core Ultra (Lunar Lake) chip can keep up with an Intel 13th- or 14th-gen Core HX.\n\nWhy would you spend more to get less? That’s clearly the question PC makers and consumers are asking themselves right now, faced with wildly oscillating tariffs and an uncertain economic future that even Intel is wondering will trigger a recession. I was all in favor of Arrow Lake’s promise to halve power for essentially equal performance — total cost of ownership is indeed a thing, and trading reduced power bills for flat performance appealed to me. But Intel didn’t even deliver on that promise, either.\n\nAt that point, Arrow Lake as a desktop processor was essentially dead to a large chunk of its enthusiast audience. (In mobile, the Core Ultra 200H/ Arrow Lake chip performed surprisingly well, though that’s also because its predecessors like Lunar Lake tried to shave power, too.)\n\nTech enthusiasts have been making the argument that, at least on the desktop, Intel really hasn’t offered anything much for years now. Certainly, AMD’s Ryzen chips have offered significant advancements. But that message is finally breaking through to the mainstream, and that’s not good news for Intel.\n\nIt all boils down to the simple argument that Intel isn’t offering anything that its older, cheaper chips can’t do. And until they can, it’s hard to believe that Intel can really dig itself out of its hole."}

However, Vatican protocol suggests that when Trump arrives at St Peter’s Basilica on Saturday morning he might not even be placed in the second row.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJD Vance struggles to handle his three children in tough parenting moment at Taj Mahal READ MORE:\n\nTrump could be disappointed by the seating plan (Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images )\n\nDelegations from around 130 countries, including 50 heads of state and 10 reigning monarchs are making their way to Rome for the Pope's funeral following his death on Monday. While the Vatican has not released any official details of the seating plan, details from the last funeral of a sitting pope indicate that Trump might have to settle for a third-row seat.\n\nDuring the funeral of Polish pontiff John Paul II in 2005, Catholic European royalty - including the King and Queen of Spain and those of Belgium - were given priority seating at the front row. Next came non-Catholic royals, which for Francis' funeral will include the Prince of Wales, who is set to attend the funeral on behalf of King Charles III, as well as the King and Queen of Sweden and the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Norway.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe funeral will be held in St Peter’s Square in Rome at 10am on Saturday (Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images )\n\nWorld leaders came third, including heads of state and other foreign dignitaries. For Francis' funeral, this will include Trump as well as Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president; Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister; and Javier Milei, the president of Argentina.\n\nTraditionally, world leaders are seated in alphabetical order according to the name of their country in French. Trump will also be joined in the world leaders section by Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt comes as their relationship becomes increasingly volatile after Trump accused Zelensky of hindering peace in the war against Russia this week. If Trump's reaction to former president Biden's position during Queen Elizabeth II's funeral is anything to go by, then he could view his placement at the Pope's funeral as a sign of disrespect.\n\nBiden was seated in the 14th row for the State Funeral of Queen Elizabeth II (Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images )\n\nBiden was seated in the 14th row during the Queen's funeral in 2022. His placement was in line with protocol that leaders of the realms that retain the monarch as their head of state were seated first and elected Commonwealth leaders behind them.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut Trump brutally mocked Biden, claiming it indicated there was \"no respect\" for the US. \"This is what’s happened to America in just two short years. No respect,\" he wrote on social media.\n\n\"However, a good time for our president to get to know the leaders of certain Third World countries.\" Trump claimed the situation would have been different if he were president, adding: “If I were president, they wouldn’t have sat me back there – and our Country would be much different than it is right now.:\"\n\nHe concluded: “In real estate, like in politics and in life, location is everything.” The Pope's funeral will mark the biggest gathering of world leaders since Trump's January inauguration.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe seating arrangements could create diplomatic awkwardness, Catherine Pepinster, a former editor of The Tablet and a commentator on the Catholic Church told The Telegraph. She explained: “One of the interesting aspects of a ceremony such as this is that the Holy See has diplomatic relations with countries such as Russia and Iran, which may mean that world leaders who would not usually meet, would encounter one another in Rome, either the night before the funeral or at the actual ceremony.\""}

Turn it off, now", "fullContent": "Microsoft’s controversial Windows Recall has now been generally released, and it poses as much of a risk to your privacy as it could be a boon to your productivity.\n\nRecall is just one of several new features that either have or will be arriving on Copilot+ PC, Microsoft said Friday. Recall, Windows’ improved semantic search, Live Captions, Cocreator, and Restyle Image and Image Creator within Photos are now all available for Copilot+ PCs that include Qualcomm Snapdragon CPUs as well as PCs with qualifying processors from AMD and Intel. A few features — Click to Do, Live Captions, and Voice Access — are available for Copilot+ PCs running on Snapdragon, but support for AMD and Intel chips isn’t quite available.\n\nFor Microsoft, the release of these AI-powered features are cause for celebration, finally delivering on promises of an AI-powered world that the company first made a year ago. But in the weeks and months since Microsoft first announced Recall, a darker side of its potential has emerged.\n\nNow, Recall and its saved snapshots provide a record of information that could be used against you. Fortunately, Microsoft hasn’t shied away from allowing you to remove Recall altogether, deleting these saved records entirely.\n\nIt’s also important to put Recall in perspective. Now, by default, Recall is opt-in, which means that you’ll have to explicitly enable it. But even if you want to use Recall, it’s only available to Copilot+ PCs, which are a tiny subset of the available PCs on the market. Just because Recall is available doesn’t mean that your PC will necessarily receive it. Even the most “modern” PCs, such as Intel’s Core Ultra 200 series (Arrow Lake) don’t have the necessary NPU power to run Recall.\n\nWindows Recall’s taskbar icon. Mark Hachman / IDG\n\nWhat is Windows Recall?\n\nMicrosoft first announced Recall at a May 2024 event at its headquarters in Redmond, Wash., where the company debuted several upcoming Windows features to complement its newly announced Copilot+ PCs. Recall was designed as a sort of search assistant: As you went about your day-to-day business, Recall would periodically take and store “snapshots” of your PC, which its optical-character recognition AI could “read.” (At the time, Recall wasn’t designed to be opt-in.)\n\nEssentially, Recall could search your PC for a piece of information without knowing the app in which it was captured, or when it was stored. In concept, Recall’s premise appealed to me.\n\nWindows Recall allows you to search for a keyword or specific data, and it returns a list of snapshots or screenshots. Mark Hachman / IDG\n\nPrivacy experts disagreed, big time. Instead of serving as a useful tool, Recall could store snapshots of information that weren’t necessarily secure, opening them up to hackers and whoever else gained access to your PC. Meanwhile, others were concerned with the vast amounts of storage needed to store all of that information. Cowed, Microsoft pulled Recall from the original Copilot+ launch and promised to perform more testing. Recall would debut in October, Microsoft said then.\n\nIn September, Microsoft began making the changes that users had asked for: making Recall opt-in, and even uninstallable after a user had decided to enable it. But it was delayed yet again. I went hands-on with Recall in early December, but by then my stance had changed — I found Recall to be a useful tool, but by then government attitudes toward privacy and free speech had begun changing. Also at that time, Microsoft opened up Recall to Copilot+ PCs using AMD and Intel processors, paving the way for a final test run before releasing it.\n\nRecall’s risks outweigh its benefits\n\nRecall will be shipped as a feature of new Copilot+ PCs, though you should be able to opt in during the original setup process. When I tested Recall, I had to manually download a new Windows build and then manually launch the Recall app, which then stepped me through its setup process. Finally, I had to specifically choose to enable Recall and store snapshots. Even after doing so, the Windows 11 Settings menu included a toggle switch that allowed me to turn off the ability to save Recall snapshots entirely, or exclude specific applications. (It still does.)\n\n(After this story was published, a Microsoft representative also emphasized that you’ll need to log in via Windows Hello to access any screenshots as well. That’s true, but I’m not sure it solves the convenience issue outlined below.)\n\nWindows uses optical character recognition to search out the relevant snapshot, but also to extract text stored within it. Mark Hachman / IDG\n\nRelated: What are Copilot+ PCs? Explained\n\nEven with all of these safeguards, I don’t trust Recall. That’s not to say I distrust Microsoft’s implementation of it — Recall is protected by Windows Hello, which is both a secure and convenient way of locking down information on your PC.\n\nIt’s the convenience of Hello that worries me. I can imagine a scenario in which I’m directed to unlock my PC via Windows Hello, which would give someone access to my documents and email — even as a journalist, whose legal protections should safeguard that correspondence. I have major concerns about Hello also unlocking a searchable database of everything I’ve done on that PC for the last few months using Windows Hello. No, I don’t have anything to hide, but I also don’t want anyone poring through anything I consider private. You shouldn’t, either.\n\nIt’s my recommendation, then, that you don’t let Recall on to your system.\n\nHow to remove Recall\n\nIf your PC is managed by a corporation or school, Microsoft says that Recall won’t be on it. Otherwise, Recall “is available by default,” Microsoft says on its Recall support page.\n\n(“An IT admin can’t, on their own, enable saving snapshots on devices that are managed by an organization or school,” Microsoft says. “IT admins can only give you the option to enable snapshots.”)\n\nRecall can be turned on and off via the optional Windows features. To access them, type “Turn Windows features on or off” within the Windows search bar. That will bring up a list of optional features that can be turned off or on depending on whether the appropriate box is checked.\n\nTo remove Recall, you’ll need to search for “Turn Windows features on and off,” then uncheck the Recall box. Mark Hachman / IDG\n\nMicrosoft shouldn’t enable Recall without telling you, as per my earlier test. But if you’re simply not sure, you can double check by running down the list of optional features and seeing if Recall is installed. (If it is, the box marked “Recall” will be checked.)\n\nTo uninstall Recall, you can simply uncheck the “Recall” box. Recall will be uninstalled and your PC will be rebooted, so be careful to save your work. As Microsoft removes Recall, it will delete your stored snapshots, too. You can re-enable Recall by checking the box at a future time, though doing so won’t restore the deleted snapshots.\n\nRecall is an optional feature; the other new AI features arriving on your Copilot PC are not. On the other hand, something like Photos’ new Restyle Image doesn’t offer anywhere near the privacy concerns that the other applications do.\n\nIf you’ve followed our coverage, you’ll know that I was in favor of Recall from the beginning. But upon further reflection and changing world events I’ve become uncomfortable with the threat that Recall poses to our privacy. Remove it immediately.\n\nClarification: Snapshots must be unlocked via Windows Hello as well, which the original story didn’t specify."}

You don’t have to memorize anything or mess with complicated mixes of numbers, letters, and symbols. Plus, they’re phishing resistant—an advantage given the increase of scams on the web.\n\nPeople I speak with are usually sold on this idea but often don’t know how to get started. But it’s dead easy. You just have to pick a way to store your passkeys. Here’s a brief overview of the different options:\n\nYour smartphone. This one’s seamless, especially if you’re most often on your phone instead of a laptop or PC. Creating passkeys is generally automated when initiating the process from a mobile app or browser. Works for both iOS and Android. Your tablet. Identical experience as on a phone. A possibly ideal alternative for those who leave their tablet at home and also worry about losing their phone and thus all their passkeys. Your PC. Windows will save passkeys for you if you initiate the process of creating one on your laptop or desktop PC. A hardware key. YubiKey and the Google Titan Security Key are examples of dongles that can not only serve as a strong two-factor authentication method but also store passkeys. (If you have an older version, it will need to support the FIDO2 protocol to be compatible with passkeys). Your password manager. Passwords won’t die out just yet, but even when they do, password managers will still have value by being a place you can store your passkeys. You will trade some potential security if the manager is cloud-based—don’t use a weak password to protect the account!—but generally, this method is reliable.\n\nMicrosoft has embraced passkeys—the company has the ambition to convert one billion users away from passwords. Microsoft\n\nYou can read more about how passkeys work in our full rundown, but basically, all you need to know is that you only need to create them and then authorize their use with either biometrics (e.g., fingerprint) or a PIN. They can’t be spoofed or compromised if a website is hacked.\n\nTheir only weakness: If you lose the device you’ve stored them on, you can’t use them. However, this problem is quickly solvable. While you can’t back them up (each passkey is unique), you can create additional passkeys on other devices as your alternate method(s) for logging in. Keeping an existing password is also a viable backup sign-in method, provided you combine it with two-factor authentication to block hackers from access.\n\nCurrently, support for passkeys continues to grow. Major services like Google, Apple, and Microsoft have already implemented them, as have major retailers (think Target, Best Buy, etc.). But even if passkeys haven’t taken over the web yet, most people who try them find that switching over some accounts to passkeys saves a lot of headache."}

In fact, it has two of them, losing two separate antitrust cases that threaten to cripple the tech giant. The Department of Justice has proposed forcing Google to sell or otherwise divest itself of the Chrome browser as its first and preferred remedy.\n\nBut who would buy it? Unsurprisingly, there are beaucoup business beaus lining up around the block for this browser bachelorette. We’ve already heard that ChatGPT maker OpenAI is very interested, as testified in court by an executive. And another notable name in the AI space, search engine Perplexity, told a judge much the same thing. Bloomberg reports that Yahoo, which almost feels like legacy media at this point, would also be interested if Chrome becomes available.\n\nThat’s three potential new homes for the world’s most popular browser. But it’s important to note that federal judge Amit Mehta hasn’t yet made a determination on how Google will be punished for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Just because prosecutors suggest breaking off Chrome doesn’t mean that he’ll agree it’s an appropriate end. And whatever happens, Google will certainly exhaust its legal options with enough money to make Solomon blush. Google losing control of Chrome is not a foregone conclusion, even if it feels that way from recent reports.\n\nBut let’s proceed under the assumption that Google does have to sell off Chrome, along with the open-source Chromium project that underpins it. Who’s actually capable of buying it? Well, that first depends on the price. The value of Chrome—a free download for all desktop and mobile platforms—is hard to pin down to a dollar amount. I’m no business guru, but if you’d asked me a year ago, I would have guessed somewhere between 50 and 100 billion dollars.\n\nBut that’s the value of Chrome to Google, incorporated with its search, advertising, and mobile properties, to say nothing of the entire Chromebook market segment, ancillary products like Google Maps and YouTube, etc. Divorced from all that, Chrome still has tons of value as the most popular browser on the planet (and the Chromium guts of many others, including Edge), but it’s undeniably less. For the sake of simplicity, let’s cut my conservative estimate in half and call it $25 billion USD.\n\nIDG / Ashley Biancuzzo\n\nWho could afford that? OpenAI could probably manage it, though it would be taking on a lot of debt to do so. The leading “AI” product maker is valued at over $150 billion, but that’s based on various investment rounds. The company has yet to turn a profit and doesn’t expect to for years (though that’s not necessarily a mark of shame in the tech world—just look at Amazon). And it’s undeniable that gaining billions of browser users would give ChatGPT an even bigger audience… and a massive treasure trove of data to train on.\n\nPerplexity is the newest player in this equation, officially releasing its large language model-powered search less than three years ago and using OpenAI’s GPT system. The latest valuation of Perplexity puts it at under $10 billion USD… which wouldn’t be enough to buy Chrome without huge debt. It would be more like Perplexity shifting its entire business model to browser-first instead of search. Not impossible, but considering that Perplexity has also made some overtures towards buying TikTok, it strikes me as a startup desperate for a new angle or identity.\n\nAnd Yahoo. Poor, poor Yahoo. Some of you reading this might not be able to remember when Yahoo was the dominant search engine before Google came along—it’s been that long since Yahoo was truly relevant. These days, Yahoo is more of a media amalgamation after being tossed around between several parent companies, and was most recently bought for $5 billion. Its most notable remaining products are probably sports news and fantasy sports platforms.\n\nThe company still owns tech site Engadget and what remains of the AOL brand, but it sold the finance-focused TechCrunch to private equity firm Regent last month. (Full disclosure: Regent also bought PCWorld parent company Foundry the day before. Hi, business daddy!)\n\nAnyway, I don’t doubt Yahoo would love to get its hands on Chrome, if only to claw its way back into relevancy for a massive amount of internet users. But I simply don’t think it has the money, not when OpenAI is splashing around investor cash like it’s puttin’ on the Ritz.\n\nMicrosoft makes the most sense to me as a new home for Chrome, as it’s been trying to regain browser dominance ever since Internet Explorer lost it two decades ago. The company has been so insistent that people switch to Edge that it’s been willing to engage in some, ahem, questionable activities to get them off Chrome. If Chrome was shifted into the “official” Windows browser—to say nothing of its dominance on other platforms—Microsoft would be pleased as punch.\n\nBut Microsoft is no stranger to browser controversy or run-ins with monopoly regulation. That might be enough of an issue to keep the company at a safe distance from the proceedings, especially if it’s clear that the Department of Justice under a Trump administration isn’t afraid to swing a big stick against monopolies."}

Ostensibly, they help gamers decide whether certain CPU and GPU components should be shackled together inside their PC cases for the sake of getting optimal performance.\n\nBut truth be told, these calculators only make bare-bones calculations about performance without factoring in other key performance modifiers. It’s why I’d never rely solely on one before buying PC components, and you shouldn’t either.\n\nWhat is a bottleneck calculator?\n\nA bottleneck refers to a mismatch between two PC components that ultimately results in there being a lag in performance. The offending component is usually called “the bottleneck.” In its worst case, a bottleneck will lead to stuttering or slower frame rates in games.\n\nOne of the most common types of bottlenecks is when an under-powered or older CPU is paired up with a powerful video card. Here, when the CPU can’t process data fast enough the video card has to wait and is held back from performing all of its own processing, thereby resulting in sub-optimal performance.\n\nTo avoid getting a bottleneck, gamers turn to bottleneck calculators (like this one from PC Builds) before they build or upgrade, which calculates a percentage difference between the two components as a rating of their performance compatibility.\n\nPercentages above 10 percent usually indicate a problem (higher is worse), whereas percentages below 10 percent are better.\n\nThe problem with bottleneck calculators\n\nAlthough they seem like a quick and convenient way to check compatibility, bottleneck calculators don’t tell you the whole story. The main problem is that their calculations, which are based off simple algorithms, are just too simplistic.\n\nThese calculators fail to factor in things like the interaction of other hardware components, your software, drivers, and optimizations — not to mention the different workloads your hardware will be put under. Here is a list of some of those oversights:\n\nAssume all workloads are the same\n\nDon’t account for overclocking or other optimizations\n\nIgnore real-world performance variations\n\nWork off often outdated hardware data\n\nFocus on GPU/CPU and neglect other hardware\n\nOversimplify hardware operations\n\nThat said, and so as a hypothetical, while you may get a result of a 20 percent CPU bottleneck from a bottleneck calculator, if you’ve overclocked your CPU and have DLSS 4, you may well not see any kind of bottleneck problem at all.\n\nBottleneck calculators, workload, and hardware\n\nFor simplicity’s sake, let’s just talk about two of the above points — workload and hardware.\n\nIn the first case, bottleneck calculators make the fatal error of assuming your CPU and GPU are always under the same load and running games at the same resolution.\n\nIn truth, the workload will vary significantly according to the game you’re playing, the resolution you’re playing at, the supporting drivers you have installed, the upscaling technologies you are running and even the background processes in operation.\n\nWhen pairing up hardware components it’s important to use common sense. Dominic Bayley / Foundry\n\nIndeed, games can differ substantially in how they are coded and processed by your hardware; a game like Counter-Strike 2 will use a lot less of your CPU than a game like Starfield, for example. Ergo, it’s too simplistic to say that there will be a bottleneck in every game you play.\n\nIn regard to hardware, bottleneck calculators completely omit how the type and speed of your RAM, the type and speed of your storage drive, and even the version of PCIe you have affects performance. This hardware shouldn’t be overlooked.\n\nFurther reading: Graphics cards are huge now. Do you need a GPU brace to protect your PC?\n\nWhy does this all matter?\n\nIt matters when gamers give too much weight to the results since it can lead to them panic buying expensive hardware that they simply don’t need.\n\nIt helps to remind yourself that most bottleneck calculators are synthetic tools that don’t gauge performance in the real-world (with the odd exception). The only bottleneck you truly have to worry about is one you will experience when you’re gaming, so keep that in mind.\n\nWhat you should do instead\n\nInstead of just relying on bottleneck calculators, you should ideally read a lot of real-world benchmarks (and account for how your CPU will perform when it’s overclocked). That’s the official advice. An extra piece of advice is to simply apply common sense when pairing your CPU and GPU.\n\nBy that I mean to match a CPU and GPU from the same generation and from the same performance tier, or one tier up for your GPU. You may not eliminate that bottleneck percentage entirely, but that’s okay — some level of discrepancy is completely normal.\n\nDifferent games will put your hardware under different loads. Bethesda\n\nAnother thing you can do is to think of your PC performance more as the culminative sum of your hardware and to buy components (within your budget) that will give you a consistent high-level performance, to ensure one isn’t holding performance back.\n\nSo, in summary, while using a bottleneck calculator may seem like a convenient method to gauge the compatibility of PC components, keep in mind that the results aren’t entirely accurate and thus should be considered accordingly.\n\nIn fact, I like to think of them as the pirate name generators of PC gaming. They may be fun to play with, but just like I wouldn’t go out and change my name to “Paddy ‘Landlubber’ Morgan the cutlass of Parrot Sands,” I similarly wouldn’t go out and buy a $3K video card just because an app tells me I need to — it just wouldn’t be proper.\n\nFurther reading: Forget FPS.

Here’s how it works\n\nImage via Pixabay\n\nGoogle has published a report on its AI Works pilot project, started last year in the UK, highlighting how AI usage can affect the productivity of individual workers. The search giant partnered with a union, small businesses, and educators from a dozen schools in the UK to trial different training methods.\n\nThe AI Works report found that generative AI can help save around 122 hours a year for people working across different sectors, exceeding its initial estimate of 100 hours per year. The pilot found that people can double their daily AI usage with just a few hours of training, and their usage remained high even months after the training.\n\nGoogle predicted last year that AI-powered innovation in the UK can lead to an economic growth of £400 billion by 2030. However, half of the projected growth depends on workers adopting and using AI tools.\n\nAbout 66% of workers, mostly older women (aged 55+) and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds, have never used generative AI at work. Women over 55 are four times less likely to use AI than men under 35, and smaller businesses lag behind larger firms.\n\nBefore the training, only 17% of women in the 55+ cohort used AI weekly and 9% used it daily. The number increased after three months when 56% were using it weekly and 29% made it a daily affair.\n\nSpeaking of the hurdles, the report found that workers need \"permission to prompt.\" They need reassurance that AI use is allowed and gives them an advantage that is legitimate, fair, and comparable to using the internet or a search engine.\n\nHabit formation can benefit AI training and leads to experimentation. After training for three months, many people started seeking prompting tips independently, watching videos, and reading articles to discover new features and use cases.\n\nGoogle joined the AI race unofficially started by OpenAI and needs more and more people to use its AI products. The company even used its AI models to recreate a movie for the 160,000-square-foot LED screen in Las Vegas and wants to fund short films about AI and humans.\n\nHowever, using AI tools in daily life might induce some hesitation as they are still prone to errors. People still have mixed thoughts about what AI will bring in the future, with a fear that their jobs may be replaced."}

Python\n\nPython のバージョンは3.7 以上が必要です。\n\nPython 3.7 より古いバージョンでは、本練習問題で紹介する Python の構文や機能の一部が使用できません。\n\nPythonのインストール Python公式サイトから最新版のインストーラをダウンロードします。\n\nインストーラを起動し、表示内容に従ってインストールを行います。\n\n基本的にデフォルト設定のまま進めて良いと思いますが、最初に表示される画面で「Add Python to PATH」にチェックを入れることをお勧めします。\n\n3. テキストエディタ\n\nPython のコードを記述および編集するためのツールが必要です。\n\nテキストエディタは何を使っても問題ありませんが、何が良いか分からない場合は Visual Studio Code (VS Code) がお勧めです。\n\nVisual Studio Code のインストール VS Codeのダウンロードページからインストールします。\n\n拡張機能「Python」「Japanese Language Pack for Visual Studio Code」をインストールします。\n\n4. Python の実行\n\n上記の環境が整った上で、Python の実行が可能であることを前提としています。\n\nPython スクリプトの実行方法 Python スクリプトとは、Python プログラムを記述した \".py\" 形式のテキストファイルのことです。\n\nスクリプトは、Python インタープリタ によって実行されます。 コマンドラインからPythonスクリプトを実行する場合、次のように３つのディレクトリが存在します。 ディレクトリ 説明 補足 カレントディレクトリ 現在の作業ディレクトリです。 コマンドラインでは cd コマンドで指定します。 スクリプトディレクトリ 実行する Python スクリプトファイルが存在するディレクトリです。 スクリプトを実行する際には、このディレクトリにあるスクリプトへのパスを、絶対パスまたはカレントディレクトリからの相対パスで指定します。 Python ディレクトリ Python インタープリタの実行ファイルや関連ライブラリが格納されているディレクトリです。 環境変数 PATH にこのディレクトリが設定されている場合、コマンドラインから python コマンドを実行する際に、インタープリタへのフルパスを指定する必要はありません。 ただし、ディレクトリとはフォルダとほぼ同じ意味です。\n\nコマンドラインから操作する文脈ではフォルダのことをディレクトリと呼ぶことが多いです。 このとき、Python を実行するにはコマンドラインで次のようなコマンドを実行します。 cd \"作業ディレクトリ\" \"Python インタープリタの実行ファイルのパス\" \"Python スクリプトファイルのパス\" このコマンドを簡単にするため、以下の条件でコマンドを作成します。 (1) Python スクリプトファイルのファイル名は \"main.py\" にする。\n\n(2) 作業ディレクトリはスクリプトディレクトリと同じディレクトリを使用する。\n\n(3) 環境変数 PATH にPython ディレクトリが設定されている。\n\n(4) Python インタープリタの実行ファイルは \"python.exe\" である。 この条件であれば、Python を実行するコマンドは次のようになります。 cd \"スクリプトディレクトリのパス\" python main.py 例えば、もし Python スクリプトファイルを \"C:\\Users\\ユーザー名\\Desktop\\practice\" に格納する場合、次のように実行します。 cd \"C:\\Users\\ユーザー名\\Desktop\\practice\" python main.py このパス \"C:\\Users\\ユーザー名\\Desktop\\practice\" はサンプルです。\n\nご自身の環境に合わせてスクリプトを格納し、そのパスを指定してください。 また、もし (3) や (4) の条件を満たしているか分からない場合、次のコマンドを実行してください。 python -V もし次のように Python のバージョンが表示された場合、条件 (3) と (4) は満たしています。 Python 3.xx.xx 逆に、もしバージョンが表示されない場合は、エラーメッセージが表示されるはずです。\n\nエラーの表示の内容は環境に応じて異なりますが、次のようなエラーメッセージのイメージです。 'python' は、内部コマンドまたは外部コマンド、\n\n操作可能なプログラムまたはバッチファイルとして認識されていません。 もしバージョンが表示されずエラーとなる場合は、次のように python3 で実行してみてください。 python3 -V これでバージョンが表示される場合、Python の実行コマンドも同様に python3 を指定します。 cd \"C:\\Users\\ユーザー名\\Desktop\\practice\" python3 main.py 最後に、Python 実行における全体像を図示すると次のようになります。\n\nこの図は、コマンドがPythonインタープリタを起動し、Pythonがスクリプトを実行する流れを示しています。 ただし、環境によってはコマンドラインを使わずにPythonを実行するなど、上記の構成を実現できないこともあります。\n\nこのような場合、一部の練習問題が取り組みにくくなる可能性がありますので注意してください。\n\n必要に応じて一部の問題をスキップするなど、ご自身の環境に合わせて調整してください。\n\n構成\n\n1. 前半問題50問\n\nPython の基本的な構文を確認・解説する練習問題です。\n\n2. 実践問題10問\n\n基本的な構文を使って Python プログラミングを行う練習問題です。\n\n3. 後半問題30問\n\nPython の基本的な構文を確認・解説する練習問題です。前半問題より実践的な構文が登場します。\n\n4. 実践問題10問\n\n基本的な構文を使って Python プログラミングを行う練習問題です。\n\n前半の実践問題より難易度が高くなっています。\n\nまた、解説文では発展的な内容について説明しています。\n\n進め方\n\nここでは私が想定する、Python に関する事前知識がない場合の進め方を記載します。\n\nもし Python に関して事前に学習済みの場合や、会社・先輩の指示がある場合は、この節を無視して各自の進め方を実施してください。\n\nPython に関する事前知識がない場合の学び方 まず、事前知識がない状態で問題を解くことはお勧めしません。\n\n悩むだけで時間が過ぎてしまい、問題を解けない可能性が高いです。\n\n最初は知識を学ぶことを優先し、解説を読む感覚で進めて良いと思います。\n\n特に、回答例のコードや解説中のサンプルコードを動かしたり、自分でコードを書き換えてみたりして Python に慣れることを推奨します。 一通り解説を読んだ後、もう一度最初から問題を解いていきましょう。\n\n事前に解説を読んでいても、それを再現するのは苦労するはずです。\n\n例えば、Python でエラーが発生する例には次のようなものがあります。 インデント（行の先頭の空白の数）が誤っている場合\n\n\".\" と \",\" を間違って入力している場合\n\n変数名や関数名が誤っている場合 作成したコードを実行してエラーが発生した場合に、そのエラーへの対処方法も学ぶべき対象と考えます。\n\nエラーが発生した場合には、基本的に次のようなエラーメッセージが表示されます。 どの行でエラーが発生したのか\n\nどのようなエラーが発生したのか エラーメッセージを元にコードを見直し、エラーを解決する方法を検討してください。\n\nエラーが発生した行にインデントの誤りやタイプミスがあるかもしれません。\n\nまた、もしエラーメッセージに見覚えがあれば、過去にも同じようなミスが発生していた可能性があります。 エラーには種類に応じて名前がついており、それだけでも原因に検討を付けることができます。\n\nよく見かけるエラーは次のようなものがあるので、エラーに対処する際に少しずつ覚えていくと良いでしょう。 エラー名 説明 対処方法 SyntaxError 文法が間違っている場合に発生 コードの構文誤りを確認（ : や () のミスなど） IndentationError インデントが適切でない場合に発生 スペースやタブを確認 TypeError 型が不適切な場合に発生 型を確認（整数と文字列の混在など） ValueError 値が不適切な場合に発生 関数に渡す値を確認 IndexError リストやタプルの範囲外のインデックスを参照した場合に発生 リストの長さを確認 KeyError 辞書に存在しないキーを参照した場合に発生 キーが存在するか確認 AttributeError オブジェクトに存在しない属性やメソッドを参照した場合に発生 変数の型を確認 NameError 定義されていない変数を使用しようとした場合に発生 変数名のスペルを確認 ModuleNotFoundError インポートしたモジュールが見つからない場合に発生 モジュール名に間違いがないか確認を追加 ZeroDivisionError 0で除算した場合に発生 ゼロで割っていないかチェック FileNotFoundError 指定したファイルが存在しない場合に発生 ファイル名とパスを確認 PermissionError ファイルやディレクトリにアクセスする権限がない場合に発生 権限の確認\n\nPython に関する事前知識がない場合の進め方 この Python 入門100本ノック は次のように解説用の問題と実践用の問題に分かれています。 基本的な構文を 確認・解説 する練習問題\n\nする練習問題 基本的な構文を使って Python プログラミングを 実践 する練習問題 そこで、私が想定する Python に関する事前知識がない場合の本練習問題の進め方は次のようになります。 「1. 前半問題50問」の内容を学ぶ。\n\n1-1. 回答例と解説を読む。\n\n1-2. 記載されている回答例やサンプルコードを動作させる。\n\n1-3. 記載されている回答例やサンプルコード参考に、自分で変更したものを動作させる。 「1. 前半問題50問」の回答や解説を見ない状態で、コードを作成・実行する。\n\n2-1. 問題文に対して自分で作成したコードを実行し、期待通りに動作することを確認する。\n\n2-2. 期待通りに動作しない場合は、その原因の調査や改善に取り組む。\n\n2-2. 必要に応じて回答例や解説を読み直す。 「2. 実践問題10問」の内容を解く。\n\n3-1. 問題文に対して自分で作成したコードを実行し、期待通りに動作することを確認する。\n\n3-2. 期待通りに動作しない場合は、その原因の調査や改善に取り組み、必要に応じて回答例や解説を読む。 「3. 後半問題30問」の内容を進める。\n\n4-1. 「1. 前半問題50問」と同様に、サンプルコードを動作しながら、解説の内容を学ぶ。\n\n4-2. 「1. 前半問題50問」と同様に、回答や解説を見ない状態で、コードを作成・実行する。 「4. 実践問題10問」の内容を解く。\n\n5-1. 「2. 実践問題10問」と同様に、コードの作成・実行と不具合発生時の調査・改善を行う。\n\n基本的な構文\n\n問題 1 出力（基本）\n\nprint 関数を使って \"Hello, World!\" を出力してください。\n\n回答例 print ( ' Hello, World! ' )\n\n解説 print 関数は引数に渡したデータを表示します。\n\n文字列の場合、シングルクォーテーション ' とダブルクォーテーション \" のどちらも使用できます。例えば、次のコードはどちらも正しいです。 print ( ' Hello, World! ' ) print ( \" Hello, World! \" ) しかし、クォーテーションを付けていない場合はエラーとなります。 print ( Hello , World ! ) 一方で数値の場合、クォーテーション ' や \" を付けずに print 関数に渡すことができます。 print ( 100 ) 文字列や数値は「データ型」や「型」などと呼ばれ、プログラミングにおける重要な概念です。\n\n文字列として扱うか数値として扱うかによって、記述の仕方が異なります。\n\n例えば、 100 を文字列として扱うことも可能です。 print ( ' 100 ' )\n\n問題 2 出力（複数行）\n\nprint 関数を複数回使って、 1 、 2 、 3 を順番に出力してください。\n\n回答例 print ( 1 ) print ( 2 ) print ( 3 )\n\n解説 Python のコードは上から順番に一行ずつ処理されていきます。\n\n例えば、回答例のコードで print(2) が print(1) より先に実行されることはありません。\n\nそのため、 1 、 2 、 3 は必ずこの順序で出力されることになります。\n\n問題 3 出力（複数項目）\n\nprint 関数を使って、数値 123 と文字列 \"Hello\" を一行に並べて出力してください。\n\n回答例 print ( 123 , ' Hello ' )\n\n解説 print 関数は複数の引数を受け取ることができ、カンマで区切ることで複数の値を出力できます。\n\n回答例のように、数値と文字列を並べて扱うことも可能です。\n\n問題 4 コメント\n\n一行コメントを使って、数値 2 の出力を行わないように次のコードを変更してください。\n\nprint ( 1 ) print ( 2 ) print ( 3 )\n\n回答例 print ( 1 ) # print(2) print ( 3 )\n\n解説 記号 # の後に記載された部分はコメントと呼ばれ、プログラムの実行には影響しません。\n\nコメントは処理を行わないように変更するだけでなく、次のように処理内容の説明やメモを書き込むためにも使用されます。 # print 関数のテスト print ( ' a ' )\n\n問題 5 複数行コメント\n\n次のコードを変更し、出力を行わないコメントに修正してください。\n\nprint ( 1 ) print ( 2 ) print ( 3 )\n\n回答例 \"\"\" print(1) print(2) print(3) \"\"\"\n\n解説 トリプルクォート \"\"\" や ''' で囲まれた部分は、改行を含んでいても１つの文字列として認識されます。\n\nこれを利用して複数行のコメントとして利用することができます。\n\nただし、厳密にはコメントの機能ではないため、次のような限定的な範囲で使用することが一般的です。 開発中の一時的なコメントアウト\n\n改行を含む文字列の定義\n\nDocstring と呼ばれるプログラムの説明文の記述\n\n変数とデータ型\n\n問題 6 変数の宣言と使用\n\n変数 x に数値 10 を代入し、その値を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = 10 print ( x )\n\n解説 変数に値を代入するには、代入演算子 = を使用します。\n\n代入された値は以後の処理でも利用可能です。\n\n例えば、回答例では print 関数を使ってその値を出力しています。\n\n問題 7 数値の加算\n\n数値 1 と 2 を足し算した結果を変数 x に代入し、その値を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = 1 + 2 print ( x )\n\n解説 数値同士に + 演算子を適用すると、数値の加算を行います。\n\n今回の例では、数値 1 と 2 を足し算した結果である 3 を取得できます。\n\n一方で、文字列を連結させた \"12\" を得るには別の処理が必要になります。\n\nこれについては次の問題で扱います。\n\n問題 8 文字列の加算\n\n文字列の \"1\" と \"2\" を結合した結果を変数 x に代入し、その値を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = ' 1 ' + ' 2 ' print ( x )\n\n解説 文字列同士に + 演算子を適用すると、文字列の連結を行います。\n\n今回の例では、文字列 '1' と '2' を文字列を連結させた '12' を取得できます。\n\n一方で、数値を足し算した 3 を得るには別の処理が必要になります。\n\n問題 9 データ型の変換\n\n整数 10 を文字列に変換して print 関数で出力してください。さらに、文字列 '10' を整数に変換して print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 print ( str ( 10 )) print ( int ( ' 10 ' ))\n\n解説 str() 関数は入力値を文字列型に変換し、 int() 関数は入力値を数値型に変換します。\n\n例えば、数値 1 と 2 を文字列として連結させて \"12\" を取得するには次のように記述します。 a = 1 b = 2 x = str ( a ) + str ( b ) print ( x )\n\n問題 10 エスケープシーケンス\n\n改行を意味する特殊な文字列\n\nを含む文字列 \"1\n\n2\n\n3\" を print 関数で出力し、改行されて表示されることを確認してください。\n\n回答例 print ( ' 1\n\n2\n\n3 ' )\n\n解説 回答例のように特殊な文字列\n\nを含む文字列を print 関数で出力すると自動的に改行されます。 1\n\n2\n\n3 このような特殊な文字列はエスケープシーケンスと呼ばれ、次のようなものがあります。 エスケープシーケンス 説明 \\r キャリッジリターン\n\n改行（New Line） \\t タブ（Tab） \\b バックスペース \\f フォームフィード \\v 垂直タブ \\\\ バックスラッシュ（\\） \\' シングルクォート（'） \\\" ダブルクォート（\"） \\xhh 16進数（Hex）表記の文字、 hh は 2 桁の 16 進数コード \\ooo 8進数（Octal）表記の文字、 ooo は最大 3 桁の 8 進数コード \\uXXXX Unicode（16bit）表記の文字、 XXXX は 4 桁の Unicode（16bit） \\UXXXXXXXX Unicode（32bit）表記の文字、 XXXXXXXX は 8 桁の Unicode（32bit） これらは、改行やタブといった特殊な文字を文字列内で表現するために使用されます。、\n\nまずは意図せず変換されてしまわないように注意すると良いでしょう。 # エスケープシーケンスの出力例 print ( \" キャリッジリターン: Hello \\r World \" ) # \\r → 行頭に戻る print ( \" 改行: Hello\n\nWorld \" ) #\n\n→ 改行 print ( \" タブ: Hello \\t World \" ) # \\t → タブ print ( \" バックスペース: Hello \\b World \" ) # \\b → 1文字削除 print ( \" フォームフィード: Hello \\f World \" ) # \\f → 一部の環境でページ送り print ( \" 垂直タブ: Hello \\v World \" ) # \\v → 垂直タブ（環境によって表示が異なる） print ( \" バックスラッシュ: C: \\\\ test \" ) # \\\\ → バックスラッシュそのまま表示 print ( \" シングルクォート: It \\' s Python \" ) # \\' → シングルクォート print ( \" ダブルクォート: She said \\\" Hello \\\" \" ) # \\\" → ダブルクォート print ( \" 16進数コード: \\x41\\x42\\x43 \" ) # \\xhh → A B C print ( \" 8進数コード: \\101 \" ) # \\101 は 'A'（8進数） print ( \" Unicode: \\u03A9 \" ) # \\uXXXX → Ω（ギリシャ文字オメガ） print ( \" Unicode絵文字: \\U0001F600 \" ) # \\UXXXXXXXX → スマイル絵文字\n\n問題 11 エスケープシーケンスのエスケープ\n\nタブ記号を意味するエスケープシーケンス \\t をエスケープして、文字列 \"C:\\test\" を表示する print 関数を実行してください。\n\n回答例 print ( ' C: \\\\ test ' )\n\n解説 次のように \"C:\\test\" をそのまま出力すると、 \\t がタブとして動作してしまい、期待通りに表示されません。 print ( \" C: \\t est \" ) 回答例のようにエスケープシーケンス \\\\ を使用することで、文字列内に \\ を文字として含めることができます。\n\nこのように、エスケープシーケンスを通常の文字として扱うための操作を エスケープ と呼びます。\n\n一部の文字列に特殊な意味を持たせるエスケープシーケンスに対し、その特殊な動作を防ぐのがエスケープです。\n\n問題 12 r文字列の使用\n\nr文字列と print 関数を使って \"C:\\test\" を出力してください。\n\n回答例 print ( r ' C:\\test ' )\n\n解説 r文字列を使うことでエスケープシーケンスを無効化し、記載した文字をそのままの形で扱うことができます。\n\nただし、文字列の末尾に \\ 記号がある場合はエラーになることに注意が必要です。 print ( r \" C:\\test\\\") # エラーになる r文字列 という言葉の由来は raw string であり、未加工の文字列を意味します。\n\n問題 13 f文字列の使用\n\n文字列変数 name に \"Python\" を代入し、f文字列と print 関数を使って \"Hello, Python!\" を出力してください。\n\n回答例 name = ' Python ' print ( f ' Hello, { name } ! ' )\n\n解説 f文字列を使って波括弧 {} 内に変数名を書くことで、文字列の中に変数の値を埋め込むことができます。\n\n変数は数値を指定することも可能です。例えば、次のように数値 1 と 2 を文字列として連結させて \"12\" を取得することもできます。 a = 1 b = 2 x = f ' { a }{ b } ' # 文字列 \"12\" が x に代入される print ( x ) f文字列 という言葉の由来は formatted string literals であり、フォーマット済み文字列リテラルを意味します。\n\n問題 14 文字列の長さ\n\n文字列 \"Python\" の長さ（文字数）を len 関数を使って取得し、 print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = len ( ' Python ' ) print ( x )\n\n解説 文字列に対して len() 関数はその文字数を返します。\n\n入力値が文字列型でない場合も、 len 関数は入力値に応じた長さを返します。 len という関数名の由来は、長さを意味する英単語 length です。\n\n問題 15 部分文字列\n\n文字列 \"Python\" を変数に格納し、最初の2文字を抽出して print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = ' Python ' print ( x [ 0 : 2 ])\n\n解説 文字列の指定位置にある文字は、0から始まるインデックスを使って取得できます。 s = ' Python ' print ( ' s[0] ' , s [ 0 ]) # 'P' print ( ' s[1] ' , s [ 1 ]) # 'y' print ( ' s[2] ' , s [ 2 ]) # 't' print ( ' s[3] ' , s [ 3 ]) # 'h' print ( ' s[4] ' , s [ 4 ]) # 'o' print ( ' s[5] ' , s [ 5 ]) # 'n' さらに、文字列の指定範囲にある部分文字列は、 [開始インデックス:終了インデックス] の形式で指定して抽出できます。\n\n開始インデックスは抽出されますが、終了インデックスは抽出されません。\n\nこの形式では開始インデックス、終了インデックスを省略することができ、省略した場合、それぞれ先頭や末尾を意味します。 s = ' Python ' print ( ' s[2:5] ' , s [ 2 : 5 ]) # 'tho' print ( ' s[:4] ' , s [: 4 ]) # 'Pyth' print ( ' s[3:] ' , s [ 3 :]) # 'hon' print ( ' s[:] ' , s [:]) # 'Python' また、インデックスには負数を指定することも可能です。\n\n負数の場合、文字列の末尾からの位置インデックスを意味します。 s = ' Python ' print ( ' s[-1] ' , s [ - 1 ]) # 'n' print ( ' s[-2] ' , s [ - 2 ]) # 'o' print ( ' s[-3] ' , s [ - 3 ]) # 'h' print ( ' s[-4] ' , s [ - 4 ]) # 't' print ( ' s[-5] ' , s [ - 5 ]) # 'y' print ( ' s[-6] ' , s [ - 6 ]) # 'P' s = ' Python ' print ( ' s[2:-2] ' , s [ 2 : - 2 ]) # 'th' print ( ' s[-2:] ' , s [ - 2 :]) # 'on' このように特定の範囲を指定して操作する機能をスライスと呼びます。\n\n問題 16 None の使用\n\n変数に None を代入し、その値を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = None print ( x )\n\n解説 None は特別な値で、変数が値を持たないことを意味します。\n\n特定の条件で値が存在しないことを示すために使います。\n\n問題 17 変数のデータ型\n\ntype 関数を使って、次の各変数のデータ型を確認してください。\n\na = 10 b = 3.14 c = \" Hello, Python! \" d = True\n\n回答例 a = 10 b = 3.14 c = \" Hello, Python! \" d = True print ( type ( a )) print ( type ( b )) print ( type ( c )) print ( type ( d ))\n\n解説 Pythonでは変数に値を代入すると、代入した値に対応するデータ型が自動的に決まります。\n\n下記はよく使われるデータ型の一覧です。 データ型 説明 例 int (整数型) 小数点を持たない数値です。正の数、負の数、ゼロが含まれます。 10 , -3 , 0 float (浮動小数点型) 小数点を含む数値です。 3.14 , -0.001 , 2.0 str (文字列型) 漢字やひらがな、アルファベットや数字、記号などの文字の並びです。 \"例１\" , 'Python' , \"123\" bool (ブール型) 正誤を意味する True と False の2つの値しか持たない型です。 True , False list (リスト型) 複数の要素を順序付けて保持する型です。 [1, 2, 3] , [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] tuple (タプル型) 複数の要素を順序付けて保持する型です。リスト型と違い、作成後に要素を変更できません。 (1, 2, 3) , (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") set (集合型) 重複しない要素の集まりを保持する型です。順序は保証されません。 {1, 2, 3} , {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"} dict (辞書型) キーと値の組でデータを保持する型です。 {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3} NoneType 特殊なデータ型で、値がないことを示します。 None type 関数を使うことで、変数がどのデータ型であるかを調べることができます。\n\nリスト操作\n\n問題 18 リストの作成と操作\n\n変数 lst にリスト [1, 2, 3] を代入してください。\n\n変数 lst とその先頭要素をそれぞれ print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] print ( lst ) print ( lst [ 0 ])\n\n解説 リストは複数の値を保持するためのデータ構造で、角括弧 [] で囲んで作成します。\n\nカンマで区切ることで複数の要素を持つリストを作成できます。\n\nリストに含まれる要素は順番に、 lst[0] 、 lst[1] 、 lst[2] のように指定することで取得できます。\n\n回答例では変数 lst にリストを代入していますが、別の変数名でも同様に指定します。\n\n例えば変数名を x にした場合は次のようになります。 x = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] print ( x ) print ( x [ 0 ])\n\n問題 19 リストのスライス\n\n変数 lst にリスト [1, 2, 3] を代入してください。\n\n変数 lst の先頭から2つの要素を抽出してできるリスト [1, 2] を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] print ( lst [: 2 ])\n\n解説 文字列から部分文字列を取得する際に使用したスライス機能を使って、リストの一部を抽出できます。\n\n回答例のように、 [:2] はリストの最初の2つの要素を返します。\n\nその他の指定方法についても、文字列の部分文字列と同様です。 lst = [ ' P ' , ' y ' , ' t ' , ' h ' , ' o ' , ' n ' ] print ( ' lst[0] ' , lst [ 0 ]) # 'P' print ( ' lst[1] ' , lst [ 1 ]) # 'y' print ( ' lst[2] ' , lst [ 2 ]) # 't' print ( ' lst[3] ' , lst [ 3 ]) # 'h' print ( ' lst[4] ' , lst [ 4 ]) # 'o' print ( ' lst[5] ' , lst [ 5 ]) # 'n' lst = [ ' P ' , ' y ' , ' t ' , ' h ' , ' o ' , ' n ' ] print ( ' lst[-1] ' , lst [ - 1 ]) # 'n' print ( ' lst[-2] ' , lst [ - 2 ]) # 'o' print ( ' lst[-3] ' , lst [ - 3 ]) # 'h' print ( ' lst[-4] ' , lst [ - 4 ]) # 't' print ( ' lst[-5] ' , lst [ - 5 ]) # 'y' print ( ' lst[-6] ' , lst [ - 6 ]) # 'P'\n\n問題 20 リストの追加\n\n変数 lst にリスト [1, 2, 3] を代入してください。\n\n変数 lst の末尾に数値 4 を追加してできるリスト [1, 2, 3, 4] を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] lst . append ( 4 ) print ( lst )\n\n解説 append メソッドはリストの末尾に新しい要素を追加します。\n\nリストオブジェクトを直接変更する処理を行い、戻り値は常に None です。\n\n例えば、以下のコードはリスト自体が変更されることを示しています。 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] result = lst . append ( 4 ) print ( lst ) # [1, 2, 3, 4] と出力される print ( result ) # None と出力される また、 append メソッドはリストオブジェクトに定義されている関数であり、リスト型の変数が持っている機能です。\n\nリスト型の変数 x に対し、 x.append() の形で使用します。 このように、オブジェクトが持っている関数をメソッドと呼びます。\n\n長さを取得する len 関数や、型を取得する type 関数等とは使い方が異なることに注意が必要です。\n\n問題 21 リストの長さ\n\n変数 lst にリスト [1, 2, 3] を代入してください。\n\n変数 lst の長さを len 関数で取得し、 print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] print ( len ( lst ))\n\n解説 len 関数は入力値に応じた長さを返します。\n\n入力値がリスト型の場合、含まれている要素の数を返します。 このように、Python に標準で用意されている汎用的な関数を組み込み関数と呼びます。\n\n組み込み関数には次のようなものがあります。 関数名 説明 print 入力値を文字列として出力する len 入力値の長さを取得する type 入力値の型を取得する str 入力値を文字列に変換する int 入力値を整数に変換する\n\n問題 22 リストの削除\n\n変数 lst にリスト [1, 2, 3] を代入してください。\n\n変数 lst から数値 2 を削除してできるリスト [1, 3] を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] lst . remove ( 2 ) print ( lst )\n\n解説 リストオブジェクトの remove メソッドは、指定した値と一致する最初の項目を削除します。\n\nappend メソッドと同様に、リストオブジェクトに定義されています。\n\nリスト内に同一の値が複数存在していた場合、最初に一致した項目のみが削除されます。\n\nまた、一致する項目が存在しない場合 ValueError が発生します。 lst = [ 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] lst . remove ( 1 ) print ( lst ) # [1, 2, 3] と出力される lst . remove ( 1 ) print ( lst ) # [2, 3] と出力される lst . remove ( 1 ) # エラーが発生する\n\n問題 23 リストの結合\n\n２つのリスト [1, 2] と [3, 4] を結合してできるリスト [1, 2, 3, 4] を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 lst = [ 1 , 2 ] + [ 3 , 4 ] print ( lst )\n\n解説 リスト同士に + 演算子を適用すると、リスト内の要素を足し合わせます。\n\n文字列や数値で使用する + 演算子と同じ書き方であり、型に応じた加算処理が行われます。 もし + 演算子ではなく append メソッドを使用した場合、次のようにリストの中にリストが含まれる結果となります。 lst = [ 1 , 2 ] lst . append ([ 3 , 4 ]) # [1, 2, [3, 4]] となる print ( lst )\n\n条件分岐とループ\n\n問題 24 条件分岐（if 文）\n\n変数 x に数値 15 を代入してください。\n\nif 文を使って、変数 x の値が 10 より大きいかどうかを判定し、10 より大きい場合に \"xは10より大きい\" と出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = 15 if x > 10 : print ( \" xは10より大きい \" )\n\n解説 if 文は条件が True と解釈された場合にブロックを実行します。\n\n条件が False の場合はブロックをスキップします。\n\n例えば、変数 x が 10 より大きい場合に \"xは10より大きい\" と出力します。 最初に変数 x に代入する値を 15 ではなく 1 などに変更すれば、10より小さい場合は \"xは10より大きい\" が表示されないことを確かめることができます。 x = 1 if x > 10 : print ( \" xは10より大きい \" ) if 文は文末にコロン : を記載し、後に続く行はインデント（字下げ）される必要があります。\n\nこれは、その行が if 文の一部であることを示すためです。\n\nもし次のように if 文の中で何も処理しないまま次の処理に進むと、インデントされていないとみなされてエラーが発生します。 x = 15 if x > 10 : # ここに処理を追加する予定 if x > 20 : # ここに処理を追加する予定 これを回避するためには pass ステートメントを使用します。\n\n次のように pass を使ってブロックを空にすることで、エラーを回避することができます。 x = 15 if x > 10 : # ここに処理を追加する予定 pass if x > 20 : # ここに処理を追加する予定 pass インデントが正しくない場合、Python はエラーを発生させます。インデントには通常4つのスペースを使用しますが、タブでも構いません。\n\nただし、インデントに使用する文字はコード全体で統一する必要があります。\n\n問題 25 条件分岐（elif、else）\n\n変数 x に数値 10 を代入してください。\n\nelif と else を使って変数 x の大きさを判定し、結果に応じて次のようにメッセージを出力してください。\n\n(1) 10 より大きい場合： \"xは10より大きい\"\n\n(2) 上記以外で 5 より大きい場合：\"xは5より大きいが、10以下\"\n\n(3) 上記以外の場合： \"xは5以下\"\n\n回答例 x = 10 if x > 10 : print ( \" xは10より大きい \" ) elif x > 5 : print ( \" xは5より大きいが、10以下 \" ) else : print ( \" xは5以下 \" )\n\n解説 if 文に続けて elif や else を使うことで、複数の条件を順に確認できます。\n\nelif 文では if 文と同様に条件を記述し、 else はいずれの条件を満たさなかったという条件を意味します。\n\nどれかの条件が True の場合、そのブロックが実行されます。 また、 True となったブロック以降の elif や else のブロックは実行されません。\n\n例えば、変数 x の値が 12 の場合、最初の if x > 10: ブロックが実行され、それ以降の elif x > 5: や else のブロックはスキップされます。 変数 x の値が 5 より大きくても、それ以前のブロックが実行されていれば elif x > 5: のブロックはスキップされます。\n\nもし x > 10 と x > 5 の両方のブロックの処理を実行させたい場合、 elif を使わずに if で記述することになります。 x = 12 if x > 10 : print ( \" xは10より大きい \" ) if x > 5 : print ( \" xは5より大きい \" ) elif は else if の省略形であり、if 文と「それ以外で」という意味の else に由来する構文です。\n\n問題 26 比較演算子（大小関係）\n\n変数 x に数値 10 、変数 y に数値 20 を代入してください。\n\n次の大小関係を確認し、それぞれの結果を True か False で出力してください。\n\n(1) x は y より大きい\n\n(2) x は y 以上\n\n(3) x は y と等しい\n\n(4) x は y 以下\n\n(5) x は y より小さい\n\n回答例 x = 10 y = 20 print ( x > y ) print ( x >= y ) print ( x == y ) print ( x <= y ) print ( x < y )\n\n解説 比較演算子は2つの値を比較し、結果を True または False で返します。\n\nそのため、次のように比較結果を変数に代入することも可能です。 x = 10 y = 20 z = x > y print ( z ) # False と表示される この例では、変数 z に x > y の結果である False が代入されます。 Python で数の大小を取得する比較演算子は次のようなものがあります。 比較演算子 意味 > より大きい < より小さい >= 以上 <= 以下 == 等しい != 等しくない 次のコードは、比較演算子の結果を整理して表示します。 x = 10 y = 20 print ( f ' x= { x } , y= { y } ' ) print ( ' xはyより大きい ' , x > y ) print ( ' xはy以上 ' , x >= y ) print ( ' xはyと等しい ' , x == y ) print ( ' xはy以下 ' , x <= y ) print ( ' xはyより小さい ' , x < y ) print ( ' xはyと異なる ' , x != y )\n\n問題 27 比較演算子（包含関係）\n\n変数 lst にリスト [1, 2, 3] を代入してください。\n\nin 演算子を使って、リストに要素 2 が含まれているか確認し、その結果を True か False で出力してください。\n\n回答例 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] print ( 2 in lst )\n\n解説 in 演算子は、指定した要素がリストに含まれているかを確認し、結果を True または False で返します。\n\nまた in 演算子は、リストに限らず、順番に要素を取り出せるオブジェクトに対して使用することができます。\n\n順番に要素を取り出せるオブジェクトはリストの他にもタプル、集合、辞書、文字列などがあります。 次のコードは文字列 \"Python\" の中に、小文字の \"p\" と大文字の \"P\" が含まれるか確認します。 print ( ' p ' in ' Python ' ) # False が表示される print ( ' P ' in ' Python ' ) # True が表示される\n\n問題 28 比較演算子（オブジェクト）\n\n変数に None を代入してください。\n\nis 演算子を使って、変数が None であるか確認し、その結果を True か False で出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = None print ( x is None )\n\n解説 is 演算子は同一オブジェクトかどうかの確認を行います。\n\n等号関係を比較する == 演算子と違い、オブジェクトが同一であるか比較ができます。\n\nつまり、２つのオブジェクトの値が一致することを確認する際に == 演算子を使用し、オブジェクト自体が同一であることを確認する際に is 演算子を使用します。\n\n例えば、次のコードは同じ要素をもつ２つのリストを == と is で比較しています。 x = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] y = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] print ( ' x == y: ' , x == y ) # 値が同じなので True print ( ' x is y: ' , x is y ) # オブジェクトが異なるので False 一方で、完全に同じリスト同士を == と is で比較すると次のようになります。 x = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] y = x print ( ' x == y: ' , x == y ) # 値が同じなので True print ( ' x is y: ' , x is y ) # オブジェクトも一致するので True 次のコードは if 文で is 演算子を使った例です。 print 関数の戻り値が None であることが分かります。 x = print ( ' print 関数の戻り値を取得します ' ) if x is None : print ( ' print 関数の戻り値は None です ' )\n\n問題 29 論理演算子\n\n変数 x に数値 10 、変数 y に数値 20 、 を代入してください。\n\n論理演算子 and や or を使って次の大小関係を確認し、それぞれの結果を True か False で出力してください。\n\n(1) x と y の両方が 15 より大きい\n\n(2) x と y の少なくとも片方が 15 より大きい\n\n回答例 x = 10 y = 20 print ( x > 15 and y > 15 ) print ( x > 15 or y > 15 )\n\n解説 and 演算子は前後の条件が両方 True と解釈される場合に True と解釈された値を返します。\n\nor 演算子は前後の条件が少なくとも片方 True と解釈される場合に True と解釈された値を返します。 False と解釈される値は False 以外にも存在し、下表の値は False と解釈されます。 値 備考 False None None オブジェクト 0 , -0 整数のゼロ（数値がない状態） 0.0 , -0.0 浮動小数点のゼロ \"\" , '' 空白の文字列 [] 空のリスト（要素なし） {} 空の辞書（キー・値なし） set() 空の集合 逆に、下表のような値は True と解釈されます。 値 説明 True 1 , -5 0 でない任意の整数 0.1 , -3.5 0.0 でない浮動小数点数 \"Python\" 空でない文字列 [1, 2, 3] 要素があるリスト {\"key\": \"value\"} 要素がある辞書 {1, 2, 3} 要素がある集合 例えば、次のように論理演算子を使用して True や False と解釈される値を得ることができます。 x = 1 and True print ( x ) また、 if 文においても True や False 以外の条件を指定することも可能です。 x = ' Python ' if x : print ( x は True と解釈されました )\n\n問題 30 論理否定\n\n変数に None を代入してください。\n\nis 演算子を使って、変数が None であるか判定し、 None ではない場合に \"x は None ではない\" を出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = None if not ( x is None ): print ( \" x は None ではない \" )\n\n解説 not 演算子は条件を反転させます。 True を False に反転し、 False を True に反転します。\n\nただし、 is 演算子や in 演算子の結果を反転したい場合は、それぞれ is not 演算子や not in 演算子を用いて記述することが一般的です。 x = ' Python ' if x is not None : print ( ' x は None ではない ' ) lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] if 0 not in lst : print ( ' 0 は lst に含まれない ' )\n\n問題 31 for ループ（リスト）\n\n変数にリスト [1, 2, 3] を代入してください。\n\nfor ループを使って、リストの全ての要素を順に出力してください。\n\n回答例 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] for item in lst : print ( item )\n\n解説 リストを用いた for ループは、指定したリスト内の全ての要素に対して順番に処理を行います。\n\n例えば for item in lst: と記述した場合、リスト lst の要素が先頭から順番に変数 item に代入されて繰り返し処理されます。\n\nつまり、次のような繰り返し処理が実行されます。 item = lst[0] と代入された状態で for 分のブロック内の処理を実行\n\nと代入された状態で 分のブロック内の処理を実行 item = lst[1] と代入された状態で for 分のブロック内の処理を実行\n\nと代入された状態で 分のブロック内の処理を実行 item = lst[2] と代入された状態で for 分のブロック内の処理を実行 ... item = lst[len(lst)-1] と代入された状態で for 分のブロック内の処理を実行 for 文は if 文と同様、文末にコロン : を記載し、後に続く行は、インデントされる必要があります。\n\n問題 32 for ループ（range）\n\nrange 関数と for ループを使って、 0 から 9 までの数を出力してください。\n\n回答例 for i in range ( 10 ): print ( i )\n\n解説 for ループはリストだけでなく、タプル、集合、辞書、文字列など、順番に要素を取り出せるオブジェクトを指定して処理を繰り返すことができます。\n\nrange 関数は指定された範囲の数値を順番に取り出せるオブジェクトを生成します。\n\nrange(n) は 0 から n-1 までの n 個の数値を生成するため、同じ処理を n 回繰り返す場合に使用されます。 もし、 0 からではなく 1 から順番に繰り返しを行いたい場合、2つの引数を指定して range(1, n) のように指定することもできます。\n\nこの場合、 range(1, n) は 1 から n-1 までの n-1 個の数値を生成するオブジェクトを返します。 for i in range ( 1 , 10 ): print ( i ) # 1, 2, 3,...,9 が順に出力される また、 range(n) はリストではないため、リストのように + 演算子で加算することができません。\n\n例えば 0 から 9 までの10ループに加えて、 20 から 29 までの10ループを合わせて合計20回の処理をしたい場合を考えます。\n\n次のような記述はエラーになってしまいます。 for i in range ( 10 ) + range ( 20 , 30 ): # `+` 演算子がエラーとなる print ( i ) これを回避するに、加算する前にリストに変換する方法があります。 for i in list ( range ( 10 )) + list ( range ( 20 , 30 )): print ( i ) list 関数はリスト型に変換処理を行うため、リストとしての加算が可能となります。\n\n型の変換が行われていることは、次のように確認できます。 x = range ( 10 ) print ( type ( x )) # range(10) の型を確認 → <class 'range'> y = list ( x ) print ( type ( y )) # リスト変換後の型を確認 → <class 'list'>\n\n問題 33 break の使用\n\n変数 x に数値 5 を代入してください。\n\n0 から 9 までの数を順番に出力する for ループ内で break を使用し、出力する値が x になった時点で処理を終了してください。\n\n回答例 x = 5 for i in range ( 10 ): if i == x : break print ( i )\n\n解説 break ステートメントを使うことで、ループの途中で終了することができます。\n\nループの実行中に特定の条件が満たされた場合に、ループを終了するのに役立ちます。\n\n問題 34 continue の使用\n\n変数 x に数値 5 を代入してください。\n\n0 から 9 までの数を順番に出力する for ループ内で continue を使用し、出力する値が x になった場合の処理をスキップしてください。\n\n回答例 x = 5 for i in range ( 10 ): if i == x : continue print ( i )\n\n解説 continue ステートメントを使うことで現在のループ処理を終了し、次のループ処理に移行することができます。\n\n繰り返し処理中に if 文と組み合わせて使用し、特定の条件を満たした場合に処理をスキップする仕組みを実現します。\n\n問題 35 while ループ\n\nwhile ループを使って、 10 から 1 まで 1 ずつカウントダウンして出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = 10 while x > 0 : print ( x ) x = x - 1\n\n解説 while ループは、指定された条件が True である限りループを繰り返します。 x = x - 1 は変数 x の値を1減らすことを意味する代入文です。\n\n例えば、 x が 10 の時に x - 1 は 9 であり、 x = x - 1 は x に 9 を代入します。\n\n同様に、 x が 9 の時に x - 1 は 8 であり、 x = x - 1 は x に 8 を代入します。 結果として、 x の値を 1 ずつ下げながら繰り返し処理を実行することができます。\n\n回答例では while の条件で x > 0 を指定しているため、 x に 0 が代入された次のループは処理が行われずに終了することになります。 また、 x = x - n は x -= n と記述しても同じ処理を実現できます。\n\n同様に、 x += n は x = x + n と同じ処理が行われます。\n\n例えば、 100 から 15 ずつカウントダウンして、負の数は表示せずに終了する場合は次のようなコードになります。 x = 100 while x > 0 : print ( x ) x -= 15\n\nデータ構造\n\n問題 36 タプルの作成と操作\n\n変数 tpl にタプル (1, 2, 3) を代入してください。\n\n変数 tpl とその先頭要素をそれぞれ print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 tpl = ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) print ( tpl ) print ( tpl [ 0 ])\n\n解説 角括弧 [] で囲んで作成したリストに対し、タプルは丸括弧 () で囲んで作成します。\n\n文字列の部分文字列やリスト操作と同じように、タプルの要素を抽出することができます。 tpl = ( ' P ' , ' y ' , ' t ' , ' h ' , ' o ' , ' n ' ) print ( ' tpl[0] ' , tpl [ 0 ]) # 'P' print ( ' tpl[1] ' , tpl [ 1 ]) # 'y' print ( ' tpl[2] ' , tpl [ 2 ]) # 't' print ( ' tpl[3] ' , tpl [ 3 ]) # 'h' print ( ' tpl[4] ' , tpl [ 4 ]) # 'o' print ( ' tpl[5] ' , tpl [ 5 ]) # 'n' tpl = ( ' P ' , ' y ' , ' t ' , ' h ' , ' o ' , ' n ' ) print ( ' tpl[-1] ' , tpl [ - 1 ]) # 'n' print ( ' tpl[-2] ' , tpl [ - 2 ]) # 'o' print ( ' tpl[-3] ' , tpl [ - 3 ]) # 'h' print ( ' tpl[-4] ' , tpl [ - 4 ]) # 't' print ( ' tpl[-5] ' , tpl [ - 5 ]) # 'y' print ( ' tpl[-6] ' , tpl [ - 6 ]) # 'P' tpl = ( ' P ' , ' y ' , ' t ' , ' h ' , ' o ' , ' n ' ) print ( ' tpl[1:-1]: ' , tpl [ 1 : - 1 ]) # ('y', 't', 'h', 'o')\n\n問題 37 タプルの結合と長さ\n\n２つのタプル (1, 2) と (3, 4) を結合してできるタプル (1, 2, 3, 4) を変数 tpl に代入してください。\n\n変数 tpl とその長さを print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 tpl = ( 1 , 2 ) + ( 3 , 4 ) print ( tpl ) print ( len ( tpl ))\n\n解説 リストと同じく、 + 演算子を用いてタプル同士の結合を行うことができます。\n\nまた、リストと同じく len() 関数でタプルに含まれている要素の数を取得することができます。 タプルとリストの違いとして、タプルは一度作成したオブジェクトに編集を加えることができません。\n\n例えば、タプルには append メソッドや remove メソッドがないため、次のコードはエラーが発生します。 tpl = ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) tpl . append ( 4 ) # エラーが発生する tpl = ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) tpl . remove ( 2 ) # エラーが発生する さらに、リストであればインデックスを指定して値を書き換えることができますが、タプルではエラーとなります。 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] lst [ 0 ] = 9 print ( lst ) # [9, 2, 3] が出力される tpl = ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) tpl [ 0 ] = 9 # エラーが発生する\n\n問題 38 集合の作成、追加、削除\n\n変数 st に集合 {1, 2, 3} を代入してください。\n\n変数 st のメソッドを使用して次の操作を順番に行い、それぞれの結果を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n(1) 変数 st に要素 1 を追加\n\n(2) 変数 st から要素 1 を削除\n\n回答例 st = { 1 , 2 , 3 } st . add ( 1 ) print ( st ) st . remove ( 1 ) print ( st )\n\n解説 集合は要素の重複を許さず、順序を持たないデータ構造です。\n\nリストやタプルのように複数の要素を持つことができますが、インデックスを指定して先頭や末尾などの要素を取得することはできません。\n\nまた、重複した要素は1つとして扱われます。 例えば、集合型オブジェクトの add() メソッドは指定した要素を追加しますが、重複する要素を追加しても変化しません。 st = { 1 , 2 , 3 } st . add ( 1 ) # 既に存在している 1 と重複するため変化しない print ( st ) # {1, 2, 3} が出力される また、集合型オブジェクトの remove() メソッドは指定した要素を削除します。\n\n指定した要素が存在しない場合、 remove メソッドはエラーとなります。 st = { 1 , 2 , 3 } st . remove ( 1 ) # 1 が削除されて {2, 3} になる st . remove ( 1 ) # 削除対象の要素が存在しないためエラーが発生する 一方で、 discard メソッドも指定要素を削除する機能を持ちますが、指定要素が存在しない場合でもエラーが発生しません。 st = { 1 , 2 , 3 } st . discard ( 1 ) # 1 が削除されて {2, 3} になる st . discard ( 1 ) # エラーとはならず、変化しない print ( st ) # {2, 3} が出力される エラーが発生しない discard メソッドですが、リストやタプルに discard は定義されていません。\n\nまた、集合に要素を追加する add メソッドも、リストやタプルには定義されていません。\n\nリストに要素を追加するメソッドは append であり、タプルは要素を追加する機能がありません。 単語 意味 定義されているデータ型 remove 「削除する」→ 指定した要素を削除（存在しない場合はエラー） リスト型 / 集合型 discard 「捨てる」「処分する」→ 指定した要素を削除（存在しない要素を指定してもエラーにならない) 集合型 add 「追加する」「付け加える」→ 指定した要素を追加（重複を許さない） 集合型 append 「付け足す」「末尾に追加する」→ 指定した要素を末尾に追加（順序を保持し、重複チェックは行われない） リスト型\n\n問題 39 集合の和集合と共通部分\n\n変数 x に {1, 2, 3} を代入し、変数 y に {3, 4, 5} を代入してください。\n\n変数 x と変数 y の和集合 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} を計算し、 print 関数で出力してください。\n\nまた、変数 x と変数 y の共通部分 {3} を計算し、 print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = { 1 , 2 , 3 } y = { 3 , 4 , 5 } print ( x . union ( y )) print ( x . intersection ( y ))\n\n解説 集合型オブジェクトの union() メソッドは、指定した集合との和集合を返します。\n\n和集合は少なくとも片方に含まれている要素を含む集合であり、両方に含まれている要素は１つにまとめられます。 また、 | 演算子も同様の結果を得ることができます。 st = { 1 , 2 , 3 } | { 3 , 4 , 5 } print ( st ) # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} が出力される 集合型オブジェクトの intersection() メソッドは、指定した集合との共通部分を返します。\n\n両方の集合に共通して含まれている要素のみを含む集合です。\n\nまた、 & 演算子も同様の結果を得ることができます。 st = { 1 , 2 , 3 } & { 3 , 4 , 5 } print ( st ) # {3} が出力される\n\n問題 40 集合の要素\n\n変数 st に集合 {1, 2, 3} を代入してください。\n\nfor 文を用いて変数 st の要素を1つずつ出力してください。\n\n回答例 st = { 1 , 2 , 3 } for x in st : print ( x )\n\n解説 リストと同様に、集合に対しても for 文で繰り返し処理を行うことができます。\n\nただし、集合は順序を持たないデータ構造であるため、要素の出力順序は一定ではありません。 また、指定した要素が集合に含まれているか確認する場合、 in 演算子を使用できます。 st = { 1 , 2 , 3 } print ( 1 in st ) # True が表示される print ( 9 in st ) # False が表示される 集合は要素の重複を許さず、順序を持たないという特徴があります。\n\n処理したい内容や目的に応じて、リストやタプルなどの他のデータ構造から最適なものを使用できます。 もし、処理の中で他のデータ構造の機能を使いたくなった場合、データ構造を変換することも可能です。\n\n次の例は、リストから重複要素を削除する目的で集合に変換する例です。 lst = [ 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] st = set ( lst ) # 集合に変換、重複要素 1 が削除される print ( st ) print ( type ( st )) リストを集合に変換すると、順番が保持されなくなってしまうことに注意が必要です。 逆に、集合をリストに変換したい場合の例は次のようになります。 st = { 1 , 2 , 3 } lst = list ( st ) # リストに変換 lst . append ( 1 ) # 末尾に重複要素 1 を追加する print ( lst ) print ( type ( lst ))\n\n問題 41 辞書の作成と操作\n\n変数 dct に辞書 {'id': '0001', 'name': 'guest'} を代入してください。\n\n変数 dct からキー 'name' の値を取得して print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 dct = { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' } print ( dct [ ' name ' ])\n\n解説 辞書はキーと値の組でデータを保持するデータ構造です。\n\n辞書型の変数 x のキー 'key' にアクセスしたい場合、 x['key'] と記述します。 次の例では、辞書型の変数 x に対し、 x['key'] の形で代入と取得の両方の処理を行います。 dct = { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' } dct [ ' key ' ] = ' value ' print ( dct [ ' id ' ], dct [ ' name ' ], dct [ ' key ' ]) # 0001 guest value が表示される もし、定義されていないキー 'key' の値を x['key'] の形で取得しようとするとエラーになります。 dct = { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' } print ( dct [ ' key ' ]) # エラーが発生する また、キーを指定すると対応する値が定まる仕組みのため、キーが重複することはできません。 例えば次のコードはキー name が重複している例です。\n\nこの場合、後から指定したキーと値の組が優先されます。 dct = { ' name ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' } # name が重複している print ( dct ) # {'name': 'guest'} が表示される\n\n問題 42 辞書のキーと値\n\n変数 dct に辞書 {'id': '0001', 'name': 'guest'} を代入してください。\n\n変数 dct に含まれるキーと値の組を取得し、 for 文を用いて順番に全て print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 dct = { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' } for key , value in dct . items (): print ( key , value )\n\n解説 辞書型のオブジェクトの items メソッドを使うとキーと値の組を取得することができます。\n\n実際に、回答例の for 文では、２つの要素 key と value を指定してます。 基本的な for 構文では、 for x in dct.items(): のように１つの要素を指定します。\n\n例えば、次のように１つの要素を指定する方法でも同じような処理を実現できます。 dct = { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' } for x in dct . items (): print ( x ) このコードの出力結果を見ると、変数 x の値が ('id', '0001') や ('name', 'guest') となっていることが分かります。\n\nつまり、キーと値の組が１つの変数に格納されており、キーと値を分けて扱うには向いていません。\n\n例えば、次のコードではキーと値を x[0] と x[1] として取得しています。 dct = { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' } for x in dct . items (): print ( f ' キー: { x [ 0 ] } , 値: { x [ 1 ] } ' ) そこで、複数の変数に同時に代入を行う機能を使用します。\n\n次のコードはタプル型のデータ ('id', '0001') を変数 x と y に同時に代入しています。 x , y = ( ' id ' , ' 0001 ' ) print ( x ) # id が出力される print ( y ) # 0001 が出力される この機能を for 文で使用すると、回答例のようにキーと値の組を同時に取得して繰り返し処理を行うことができます。\n\nこの場合、キーと値は key と value として取得できるため、上記の例のように x[0] や x[1] と記述する必要がありません。 dct = { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' } for key , value in dct . items (): print ( f ' キー: { key } , 値: { value } ' )\n\n問題 43 リスト内包表記\n\nリスト内包表記を使って、 1 以上 10 未満の偶数リストを作成し、そのリストを print で表示してください。\n\n回答例 even_list = [ x for x in range ( 1 , 10 ) if x % 2 == 0 ] print ( even_list )\n\n解説 リスト内包表記は簡潔なリストの生成方法です。\n\n条件を追加して特定の要素だけを含めることができます。 リスト内包表記の構文は次のようになります。 [ 式 for 変数 in 繰り返しオブジェクト if 条件 ] このリスト内包表記でできるリストは、次の処理でできる変数 result と同じです。\n\nただ、作成されるリストデータは同じですが、リスト内包表記を用いた方が高速に処理できます。 result = [] # 空のリストを作成 for 変数 in 繰り返しオブジェクト : if 条件 : result . append ( 式 ) この構文を用いて、回答例では range(1, 10) に含まれる要素 x の内、 x % 2 == 0 を満たすものを抽出しています。\n\nx % 2 は x を 2 で割った余りを計算し、 x % 2 == 0 は x が 2 で割り切れるか判定します。 つまり、回答例の処理をリスト内包表記を使わずに記載すると次のようになります。 even_list = [] for x in range ( 1 , 10 ): if x % 2 == 0 : even_list . append ( x ) print ( even_list ) このコードと回答例を見比べると、 for x in range(1, 10) や if x % 2 == 0 の部分は全く同じであることが分かります。 また、問題の内容を 1 以上 5 未満の整数を2倍したリストと読み替えて、次のような記述で同じ結果を得ることもできます。 even_list = [ 2 * x for x in range ( 1 , 5 )] print ( even_list )\n\nその他の基本操作\n\n問題 44 文字列の置換\n\n変数 x に文字列 \"1, 2, 3\" を代入してください。\n\n変数 x に含まれる文字 \",\" を文字 \"&\" に置換した文字列 \"1& 2& 3\" を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = ' 1, 2, 3 ' print ( x . replace ( ' , ' , ' & ' ))\n\n解説 文字列型オブジェクトの replace メソッドは、指定された文字列を別の文字列に置換します。\n\nこのとき元の文字列は変更されず、新しい文字列が返されます。\n\n次のコードは、 replace メソッドが元の文字列を変更しないことを確認しています。 x = ' 1, 2, 3 ' x . replace ( ' , ' , ' & ' ) print ( x ) # 1, 2, 3 が出力される 一方で、リスト型オブジェクトの append メソッドや remove メソッドは元のリストを変更します。 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] lst . append ( 4 ) print ( lst ) # [1, 2, 3, 4] が出力される オブジェクトに定義されているメソッドには、結果を戻り値で返すものとオブジェクトの値を更新するものがあることに注意が必要です。\n\n問題 45 文字列の分割と結合\n\n変数 x に文字列 \"1, 2, 3\" を代入してください。\n\n変数 x を文字 \",\" で分割してできるリスト ['1', ' 2', ' 3'] を変数 lst に代入し、変数 lst を print 関数で出力してください。\n\nさらに、変数 lst 内の文字列を文字列 \"&\" で結合してできる文字列 \"1& 2& 3\" を変数 y に格納し、変数 y を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = ' 1, 2, 3 ' lst = x . split ( ' , ' ) print ( lst ) y = ' & ' . join ( lst ) print ( y )\n\n解説 文字列型オブジェクトの split メソッドは、指定された区切り文字で文字列を分割してできるリストを返します。\n\nもし区切り文字を指定しなかった場合、 split メソッドは連続したホワイトスペースで分割を行います。 x = ' 1 2 3 4 ' print ( x . split ()) # ['1', '2', '3', '4'] が出力される ここで、ホワイトスペースとは以下の文字などの空白の文字を意味します。 スペース ( )\n\n) タブ ( \\t )\n\n) 改行 (\n\n)\n\n) キャリッジリターン ( \\r )\n\n) 垂直タブ ( \\v )\n\n) 改ページ ( \\f ) 文字列型オブジェクトの join メソッドは、指定されたリストの要素を自身の文字で結合してできる文字列を返します。\n\n文字列型オブジェクト自身に制約はありません。\n\n次の例は、長さ 0 の文字列 \"\" や長さ 5 の文字列 \" and \" に対して join メソッドを使用した例です。 lst = [ ' a ' , ' b ' , ' c ' ] print ( '' . join ( lst )) # abc が出力される print ( ' and ' . join ( lst )) # a and b and c が出力される しかし、結合対象のリストの要素は文字列型である必要があります。\n\n次の例は、数値型の要素からなるリストを指定した場合にエラーが発生することを示しています。 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ' & ' . join ( lst ) # エラーが発生する また、結合対象のリストを省略することはできません。 ' & ' . join () # エラーが発生する\n\n問題 46 数値計算\n\n変数 x に数値 10 、変数 y に数値 3 を代入してください。\n\n次の計算を行い、結果を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n(1) x と y を掛けた結果（積）\n\n(2) x を y で割った結果（小数表示）\n\n(3) x を y で割った整数部分\n\n(4) x を y で割った余り\n\n回答例 x = 10 y = 3 print ( x * y ) print ( x / y ) print ( x // y ) print ( x % y )\n\n解説 掛け算の計算は * 演算子を使用します。\n\n例えば、 x * y は変数 x の値と変数 y の値を掛け合わせた結果を計算します。 通常の割り算の計算は / 演算子を使用します。\n\n例えば、 x / y は変数 x の値を変数 y の値で割った結果を浮動小数点数（小数）として計算します。 ただし、浮動小数点数は厳密な精度を持たないことがあるため、計算結果の誤差に注意が必要です。\n\n例えば、コンピュータは 0.1 + 0.2 のような計算を完全に正確には扱えません。 print ( 0.1 + 0.2 ) # 0.30000000000000004 が出力される 割り算の整数部分の計算は、 // 演算子を使用します。\n\n計算結果が負の少数の場合、 // は小さくなるように整数部分を取得します。\n\n例えば、 -9 / 2 は -4.5 ですが、 -9 // 2 は -5 を整数部分として取得します。 割り算の余りの計算は、 % 演算子を使用します。\n\nx % y は 0 以上 |y| 未満の値を返します。\n\nx と y が整数であれば、 (x // y) * y + (x % y) は x と同じ値になります。\n\n問題 47 リスト操作\n\n変数 lst にリスト [1, 2, 3] を代入してください。\n\n変数 lst に含まれる数値の最大値を取得し、 print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] print ( max ( lst ))\n\n解説 max 関数は、与えられた項目の中で最も大きな値を返します。\n\n数値からなるリストであれば数値としても最大の値を返し、文字列からなるリストであれば辞書順で最後の文字列を返します。\n\nエラー処理\n\n問題 48 エラーハンドリング\n\n変数 x に数値 0 を代入してください。\n\n数値 1 を x で割った値を計算し、結果を print 関数で出力してください。\n\nただし、 try と except を使ってゼロ除算エラー ZeroDivisionError を検知し、エラーが発生した場合は \"ゼロ除算エラーが発生しました\" と出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = 0 try : print ( 1 / x ) except ZeroDivisionError : print ( ' ゼロ除算エラーが発生しました ' )\n\n解説 try 句内でエラーが発生した場合、 except 句に記載した処理が実行されます。\n\ntry 句は if 文や for 文と同様、文末にコロン : を記載し、後に続く行はインデントされる必要があります。 これを使用すると、想定されるエラーに対し、エラー内容に応じた処理を実装することができます。\n\nこのような仕組みをエラーハンドリングと呼びます。 回答例では ZeroDivisionError が発生することを想定してエラーハンドリングしています。\n\nもしエラーが発生し、そのエラーがエラーハンドリングされなかった場合、プログラムは異常終了してしまいます。 つまりエラーハンドリングを行わない場合、エラーが発生した箇所以降の処理が行われず、期待していた処理が実行されない可能性があります。 x = 0 y = 1 / x print ( ' 処理を終了しました ' ) # 前の行でエラーが発生するため、この行は処理が行われない そこでエラーハンドリングを行うことで、仮にエラーが発生しても、期待する処理を実行させることができます。 x = 0 try : y = 1 / x except ZeroDivisionError : print ( ' ゼロ除算エラーが発生しました ' ) print ( ' 処理を終了しました ' ) 補足ですが、Python のエラーは構文エラー（SyntaxError）と実行時エラー（Exception）の２種類があります。\n\n厳密には、 try 句でエラーハンドリングできるのは実行時エラーだけです。\n\nここでは、主に実行時エラーのことをエラーと呼んでいます。\n\n問題 49 エラー処理\n\n変数 x に None を代入してください。\n\n変数 x の値を 2 倍した値を print 関数で出力してください。\n\nただし、 try と except を使って型エラー TypeError を検知し、エラーが発生した場合はエラー内容を出力してください。\n\n回答例 x = None try : print ( x * 2 ) except TypeError as e : print ( e )\n\n解説 変数 x に None が代入された状態で x * 2 という演算を行おうとすると、 TypeError が発生します。\n\nexcept 句で as キーワードを使用すると、発生したエラーの情報を取得することができます。 回答例では except TypeError as e: と記載することで、 TypeError の内容を変数 e に格納しています。\n\n変数 e の値を print 関数で出力すると、今回の場合は次のようなエラーメッセージが表示されます。 unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'int' これは * 演算子が NoneType 型と int 型では操作できないということを意味しています。\n\nこのようなメッセージを出力しておくことで、予期せぬエラーが発生した際の調査に役立つ可能性があります。\n\n問題 50 意図的なエラー\n\n変数 x に数値 -1 を代入してください。\n\n変数 x の値が負であるか判定し、負の値の場合に ValueError を発生させてください。\n\nこのとき、エラーメッセージは \"負の値が入力されました\" にしてください。\n\n回答例 x = - 1 if x < 0 : raise ValueError ( ' 負の値が入力されました ' )\n\n解説 raise キーワードを使って意図的に例外を発生させます。\n\nこれにより、特定の条件下でエラーを通知することができます。\n\nさらに、 try 句と組み合わせて使用することで、より高度なフローを作成することができます。\n\n例えば、年齢を入力する場面で負の値が入力された場合にエラーを発生させ、入力処理に戻るようなフローが考えられます。\n\n問題 51 九九の計算表示\n\n２重の for 文を使って、次のような九九の計算を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n1 × 1 = 1\n\n1 × 2 = 2\n\n...\n\n1 × 9 = 9\n\n2 × 1 = 2\n\n...\n\n2 × 9 = 18\n\n...\n\n9 × 1 = 9\n\n...\n\n9 × 8 = 72\n\n9 × 9 = 81\n\n回答例 for i in range ( 1 , 10 ): for j in range ( 1 , 10 ): print ( f ' { i } × { j } = { i * j } ' )\n\n解説 問題文に「２重の for 文を使って」と指示があるので、それぞれのループで使用する繰り返し変数を２つ用意しましょう。\n\n変数名は何でも良いですが、回答例では i と j としています。\n\n九九を表現するため、 i と j はそれぞれ 1 から 9 を順番に繰り返すことを想定しています。 このとき、f文字列を使えば九九の計算式は f'{i} × {j} = {i * j}' で表現できます。\n\n例えば、次のようなコードで計算式が期待通りに表示できるか試すことができます。 i = 1 j = 2 print ( f ' { i } × { j } = { i * j } ' ) もちろん、f文字列を使わずに他の方法で計算式を表示する方法もあります。 i = 1 j = 2 print ( i , ' × ' , j , ' = ' , i * j ) 次に、この計算式を２重の for ループと組み合わせていきます。\n\n問題文に記載された出力例で、まずは最初の数行に着目します。 1 × 1 = 1\n\n1 × 2 = 2\n\n...\n\n1 × 9 = 9 この部分は、掛け算の左側の値が 1 で固定されており、最初に 1 の段を表示することが分かります。\n\n先ほどの計算式を使うと、 i を 1 で固定し、 j を 1 から 9 まで繰り返すことで、この部分は表示できそうです。 i = 1 for j in range ( 1 , 10 ): print ( f ' { i } × { j } = { i * j } ' ) for 文の書き方についても、他の方法で記載して問題ありません。\n\n例えば range 関数の使い方に慣れていない場合、次のように後から 1 をプラスするという方法もあります。 i = 1 for x in range ( 9 ): j = x + 1 print ( f ' { i } × { j } = { i * j } ' ) また、 range 関数自体を覚えていなかった場合、繰り返したい値を列挙する方法もあります。 i = 1 for j in [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ]: print ( f ' { i } × { j } = { i * j } ' ) 次に、掛け算の左の値が 1 で固定されていた部分を動かしていきます。\n\n問題文の出力例の続きを見ると、次は 2 の段です。 1 × 1 = 1\n\n1 × 2 = 2\n\n...\n\n1 × 9 = 9\n\n2 × 1 = 2\n\n...\n\n2 × 9 = 18 もし for 文を使わなければ、次のように i を変えながら同じ処理を繰り返していくことになります。 i = 1 for j in range ( 1 , 10 ): print ( f ' { i } × { j } = { i * j } ' ) i = 2 for j in range ( 1 , 10 ): print ( f ' { i } × { j } = { i * j } ' ) i = 3 for j in range ( 1 , 10 ): print ( f ' { i } × { j } = { i * j } ' ) この内容を for 文で記載すると、回答例のようなコードになります。\n\n問題 52 ループと条件分岐と文字列操作\n\n100 未満の正の整数の内、いずれかの桁が 3 である数を全て表示してください。\n\n回答例 for i in range ( 1 , 100 ): if ' 3 ' in str ( i ): print ( i )\n\n解説 まず、問題文の「 100 未満の正の整数」に着目します。\n\nrange 関数を使えば、次のように 100 未満の正の整数を全て表示することができます。 for i in range ( 1 , 100 ): print ( i ) ここから、条件「いずれかの桁が 3 である」を満たす場合にのみ表示するように条件分岐を行う必要があります。\n\nこの条件の判定を行うにあたり、大きく２つの方針が考えられます。 (1) 整数の各桁の値を取得し、 3 に一致するか判定する。\n\n(2) 整数を文字列として扱い、いずれかの文字が \"3\" に一致するか判定する。 まず方針 (1) では、各桁の値をどのように取得するかが問題になります。\n\n今回の場合、調べたい値が 100 未満の正の整数となっているので、 10 で割った整数部分と余りで取得できます。\n\nつまり 100 未満の正の整数 i に対し、1の位の値は i % 10 、10の位の値は i // 10 で取得できます。 例えば、次のコードは適当に選んだ 100 未満の正の整数 57 に対して 10 で割った整数部分と余りを取得しています。 i = 57 print ( i % 10 ) # 7 が表示される print ( i // 10 ) # 5 が表示される この方法で取得した各桁の値を 3 と比較し、一致する場合に print 関数で表示するには次のコードのようになります。 for i in range ( 1 , 100 ): if i % 10 == 3 or i // 10 == 3 : print ( i ) このコードは正しく動作しますが、割り算の計算部分と論理演算 or を組み合わせている部分がやや複雑に見えます。\n\nそこで、整数を文字列として扱う方針 (2) を考えてみます。 まず、整数 i を文字列として扱うには str 関数を使用します。\n\n型の変換がうまくいっているか確認するには type 関数が役立ちます。 i = 57 x = str ( i ) print ( type ( i )) # <class 'int'> が表示される print ( type ( x )) # <class 'str'> が表示される 次に、方針 (1) で各桁の値を計算したように、文字列の各文字を１つずつ取得する方法を考えてみましょう。\n\n文字列型の変数 x に対して、先頭文字は x[0] 、次の文字は x[1] のように取得できます。\n\nつまり、2桁の整数が文字列化されている前提であれば、次のように各桁の値を取得できます。 i = 57 x = str ( i ) print ( x [ 0 ]) # 5 が表示される print ( x [ 1 ]) # 7 が表示される これを用いて、各桁の値を \"3\" と比較し、一致する場合に print 関数で表示するコードを書いてみます。 for i in range ( 1 , 100 ): x = str ( i ) if x [ 0 ] == ' 3 ' or x [ 1 ] == ' 3 ' : # ここが問題 print ( i ) しかし、このコードを実行すると if x[0] == '3' or x[1] == '3': の部分で次のようなエラーが発生してしまいます。 IndexError: string index out of range これは、文字列に範囲外のインデックスを指定してアクセスしようとしたときに発生するエラーです。\n\n例えば、整数 1 を文字列化した長さ 1 の文字列 x に対し、2桁目にあたる x[1] はアクセスに失敗しエラーとなります。\n\nつまり、2桁の整数が文字列化されていることを想定しており、1桁の整数が文字列になった場合の処理が考慮されていなかったのです。 この方針のままエラーを回避する方法はいくつかありますが、変更箇所が少なくて済むのは末尾の文字を取得する方法です。\n\n2文字目へのアクセスのために x[1] を使用していましたが、2文字目ではなく末尾の文字 x[-1] を使用するのです。 整数が1桁の場合、先頭の文字と末尾の文字は一致し、該当の1桁の文字を取得することになります。 i = 1 x = str ( i ) print ( x [ 0 ]) # 1 が表示される print ( x [ - 1 ]) # 1 が表示される もちろん、整数が2桁の場合は両方の桁の値を取得することができます。 i = 57 x = str ( i ) print ( x [ 0 ]) # 5 が表示される print ( x [ - 1 ]) # 7 が表示される 結果として、次のようなコードでいずれかの桁が 3 である整数を表示できます。 for i in range ( 1 , 100 ): x = str ( i ) if x [ 0 ] == ' 3 ' or x [ - 1 ] == ' 3 ' : print ( i ) このコードは正しく動作しますし、方針 (1) での割り算による計算処理がシンプルになっています。\n\nただ、論理演算 or の部分は残っていますし、 x[-1] を使用している点が理解しにくいかもしれません。 そこで、各桁の値を取得して \"3\" に一致するか判定する方針を変えて、文字列 \"3\" が含まれているか判定する方針を考えます。\n\nつまり、次のように in 演算子を使用して包含関係の比較を行う方針です。 i = 57 x = str ( i ) print ( ' 3 ' in x ) この方法であれば、各桁の値を取得して比較する処理は不要になります。\n\n回答例はこの方針で作成したコードとなっています。\n\n問題 53 ループの終了条件\n\n正の整数の内、いずれかの桁が 3 である数を小さいほうから100個表示してください。\n\n回答例 num = 1 count = 0 while count < 100 : if ' 3 ' in str ( num ): print ( num ) count += 1 num += 1\n\n解説 この問題では正の整数を小さい順に判定し、条件を満たすものを100個見つけるまで処理を繰り返す必要があります。\n\n見つけるべき整数の個数は100個と指定されていますが、繰り返しの回数は事前に特定できません。\n\nこのような場合には、条件が満たされるまで処理を繰り返す while 文を使うのが良いでしょう。\n\nこのとき、次の２種類の変数が必要になります。 (1) 条件を満たすか判定するため、小さい順に数え上げる正の整数\n\n(2) 条件を満たした整数をいくつ見つけたか数えるための整数 ここでは、(1) のための変数を num 、(2) のための変数を count とすることにします。\n\n変数 num は小さい順に数え上げる正の整数なので、最初は 1 を代入しておきます。\n\nまた、変数 count は条件を満たした個数を表すため、最初は 0 を代入しておきます。 num = 1 count = 0 これらの変数を用いて、 while 文の構造を考えます。\n\n繰り返し処理の継続条件は100個見つけるまでです。\n\nつまり、 while 文の繰り返し条件に count < 100 を指定します。 変数 num は小さい順に数え上げるものであるため、繰り返し処理で毎回 1 ずつ増やしていきます。\n\n一方で、変数 count は変数 num が条件を満たした際に 1 増やし、表示した整数の個数を記録します。 この方針で、 while 文の全体を記述すると次のようになります。 num = 1 count = 0 while count < 100 : if True : count += 1 num += 1 この時点では条件を満たすかどうかの判定を無視しています。\n\nつまり、常に条件を満たすことを意味する True を判定条件にして、 if 文を if True: と記載しています。 ただ、このコードは print 関数を含んでいないため、実行しても何も出力されません。\n\nそこで、条件を満たした際に判定対象の整数 num を表示するように print 関数を追加します。\n\nこの出力処理は変数 num が条件を満たした場合のみ実行させたいので、 print 関数は if 文の中に追加します。 num = 1 count = 0 while count < 100 : if True : print ( num ) count += 1 num += 1 最後に、変数 num が条件を満たすかの判定処理を考えます。\n\n問題文の条件は「いずれかの桁が 3 である」となっており、前問と同様の方針が使えます。\n\n整数型の変数 num を文字列型に変換すれば、 in 演算子を使って文字列 \"3\" が含まれているか確認することができます。 i = 57 x = str ( i ) print ( ' 3 ' in x ) この方法を先ほどの while 文と組み合わせれば、回答例のコードになります。\n\n問題 54 2次元リストの操作\n\n変数 list_2d に2次元リスト [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] を代入してください。\n\n変数 list_2d に含まれる数値要素 1 , 2 ,..., 9 を、それぞれ 2 倍して順番に表示してください。\n\n回答例 list_2d = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]] for row in list_2d : for item in row : print ( item * 2 )\n\n解説 2次元リストは、中に含まれている要素がリストになっているリストです。\n\n行と列を持つ表のような構造と捉えることができます。 [1, 2, 3] # 1つ目の要素\n\n[4, 5, 6] # 2つ目の要素\n\n[7, 8, 9] # 3つ目の要素 実際に、次のようにインデックスを指定することで、上記のようなデータ構造を確認できます。 list_2d = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]] print ( list_2d [ 0 ]) print ( list_2d [ 1 ]) print ( list_2d [ 2 ]) また、次のように for 文を使うことで同様のデータ構造を確認できます。 list_2d = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]] for row in list_2d : print ( row ) さらに、上記で表示したリストデータに含まれる用をアクセスしてみましょう。\n\nインデックスを指定する方法を使う場合、さらに2つ目の角括弧 [] を指定することになります list_2d = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]] print ( list_2d [ 0 ][ 0 ], list_2d [ 0 ][ 1 ], list_2d [ 0 ][ 2 ]) print ( list_2d [ 1 ][ 0 ], list_2d [ 1 ][ 1 ], list_2d [ 1 ][ 2 ]) print ( list_2d [ 2 ][ 0 ], list_2d [ 2 ][ 1 ], list_2d [ 2 ][ 2 ]) インデックス指定を for 文を使う方法と組み合わせて使用することも可能です。 list_2d = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]] for row in list_2d : print ( row [ 0 ], row [ 1 ], row [ 2 ]) 逆に、２重の for 文を使用することも可能です。 list_2d = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]] for row in list_2d : for item in row : print ( item ) この問題では「それぞれ 2 倍して順番に表示」とのことなので、 print 関数内で値を 2 倍する処理を追加します。\n\n回答例では２重の for 文を使用し、取得した数値要素を 2 倍して出力しています。\n\n問題 55 2次元リストの作成\n\nリスト内包表記を用いて次のような要素を持つ 10×10 の2次元リストを作成し、 print 関数で出力してください。\n\n['0-0', '0-1', '0-2', '0-3', '0-4', '0-5', '0-6', '0-7', '0-8', '0-9']\n\n['1-0', '1-1', '1-2', '1-3', '1-4', '1-5', '1-6', '1-7', '1-8', '1-9']\n\n['2-0', '2-1', '2-2', '2-3', '2-4', '2-5', '2-6', '2-7', '2-8', '2-9']\n\n['3-0', '3-1', '3-2', '3-3', '3-4', '3-5', '3-6', '3-7', '3-8', '3-9']\n\n['4-0', '4-1', '4-2', '4-3', '4-4', '4-5', '4-6', '4-7', '4-8', '4-9']\n\n['5-0', '5-1', '5-2', '5-3', '5-4', '5-5', '5-6', '5-7', '5-8', '5-9']\n\n['6-0', '6-1', '6-2', '6-3', '6-4', '6-5', '6-6', '6-7', '6-8', '6-9']\n\n['7-0', '7-1', '7-2', '7-3', '7-4', '7-5', '7-6', '7-7', '7-8', '7-9']\n\n['8-0', '8-1', '8-2', '8-3', '8-4', '8-5', '8-6', '8-7', '8-8', '8-9']\n\n['9-0', '9-1', '9-2', '9-3', '9-4', '9-5', '9-6', '9-7', '9-8', '9-9']\n\n回答例 list_2d = [[ f ' { x } - { y } ' for y in range ( 10 )] for x in range ( 10 )] print ( list_2d )\n\n解説 この問題では、要素としてリストを含むリストを作成する必要があります。\n\n通常のリスト内包表記はリストを作成する機能です。\n\nこの問題のように2次元リストを作成するには、リスト内包表記の中にリスト内包表記を含む構造になると考えられます。 まずは、問題文で提示されている最初のリスト要素に着目してみましょう。 ['0-0', '0-1', '0-2', '0-3', '0-4', '0-5', '0-6', '0-7', '0-8', '0-9'] このリストの要素は \"0-y\" の形の文字列で、\"y\" は列番号に対応していることがわかります。\n\nそのため、列番号 y に対する要素はf文字列を使って f'0-{y}' と記述できます。 以上を踏まえると、最初の要素は次のリスト内包表記で作成できることが分かります。 row = [ f ' 0- { y } ' for y in range ( 10 )] print ( row ) 続いて、2番目のリスト要素に着目します。 ['1-0', '1-1', '1-2', '1-3', '1-4', '1-5', '1-6', '1-7', '1-8', '1-9'] 先頭のリスト要素では \"0-y\" の形の文字列だった要素が、 \"1-y\" の形の文字列になっています。\n\nそのため、先頭のリストと同様に考えることで、次のリスト内包表記で作成できることが分かります。 row = [ f ' 1- { y } ' for y in range ( 10 )] print ( row ) これ以降も同様で、 要素の形が \"0-y\", \"2-y\", \"3-y\",..., \"9-y\" と順番に変わっているだけです。\n\nこの変わっている部分を整数型の変数 x で表すと、次のように共通の形で書くことができます。 x = 3 row = [ f ' { x } - { y } ' for y in range ( 10 )] print ( row ) 目的の2次元リストは、このリストを要素に持つようにリスト内包表記で作成できます。\n\n変数 x を 0 から 9 の範囲で順番に動くように指定すれば、回答例のコードになります。\n\n問題 56 辞書の操作\n\n変数 ascii_dict に辞書 {'0x30': '0', '0x40': '@', '0x50': 'P'} を代入してください。\n\n変数 ascii_dict のキーと値を逆にした辞書 {'0': '0x30', '@': '0x40', 'P': '0x50'} を作成し、 print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 ascii_dict = { ' 0x30 ' : ' 0 ' , ' 0x40 ' : ' @ ' , ' 0x50 ' : ' P ' } reversed_dict = { value : key for key , value in ascii_dict . items ()} print ( reversed_dict )\n\n解説 指定された辞書型の変数 ascii_dict のキーと値は items 関数を使って順番に取り出すことができます。\n\nこれを用いて、目的の「キーと値を逆にした辞書」を新たな変数 reversed_dict に格納することにします。 まず、変数 reversed_dict を何も含まない空の辞書にしておきます。\n\nその後、 items 関数で取得したキーと値を逆にして、順番に変数 reversed_dict に設定していきます。 reversed_dict = {} for key , value in ascii_dict . items (): reversed_dict [ value ] = key print ( reversed_dict ) このとき、辞書のキーが重複できないことに注意が必要です。\n\nもし元の辞書 ascii_dict の２つのキーで値が一致していた場合、キーと値を逆にした際に変数 reversed_dict のキーが重複してしまいます。\n\nそして重複したキーをそのまま保持することは不可能です。 ただし、今回の問題で指定された辞書 ascii_dict では値が重複していないため、そのような問題は発生しません。\n\nもし元の辞書で値が重複する可能性がある場合、エラーとして処理したり、いずれか１つのキーと値のみを保持する仕組みにするなどの対応が必要になります。 結果として、先ほどのコードで「キーと値を逆にした辞書」を出力することができます。 {'0': '0x30', '@': '0x40', 'P': '0x50'} また、この for 文を用いた処理は辞書内包表記を使って実現できます。\n\n辞書内包表記はリスト内包表記と似た構文で、キーと値のペアを条件指定して辞書を作成する機能です。 回答例では辞書内包表記を使って、キーと値を逆にした辞書を簡潔に作成しています。\n\n問題 57 文字列のカウント\n\n変数 target_text に文字列 \"hello\" を代入してください。\n\n変数 target_text に含まれる各文字の出現回数をカウントし、文字と出現回数の組を全て表示してください。\n\n回答例 target_text = ' hello ' count_dict = {} for char in target_text : if char in count_dict : count_dict [ char ] += 1 else : count_dict [ char ] = 1 print ( count_dict )\n\n解説 この問題では、変数 target_text に含まれる各文字を順にチェックし、各文字の出現回数をカウントします。\n\n各文字の出現回数は辞書型の変数 count_dict を作成して保持することにします。\n\n変数 count_dict のキーはカウント対象の文字で、その文字の出現回数を値に保持します。 例えば、1文字目の \"h\" をチェックする処理で、変数 count_dict を {'h': 1} にして出現回数を保持します。\n\n2文字目の \"e\" をチェックする処理では、同様に {'h': 1, 'e': 1} のように出現回数を保持します。\n\n全ての文字をチェックした時点で、文字列 \"hello\" に含まれる各文字の出現回数を次のように保持しているイメージです。 { ' h ' : 1 , ' e ' : 1 , ' l ' : 2 , ' o ' : 1 } そこで、まずは各文字の出現回数を格納するための空の辞書 count_dict を作成します。\n\n文字列がの変数 target_text に含まれる文字は、 for 文で順番に取得できます。 target_text = ' hello ' count_dict = {} for char in target_text : print ( f ' 文字 { char } の出現回数をカウントする ' ) 文字 char に対して変数 count_dict のカウントを増やすには count_dict[char] += 1 を実行します。\n\nしかし、この処理をそのまま適用することはできません。 target_text = ' hello ' count_dict = {} for char in target_text : count_dict [ char ] += 1 # エラーが発生する 上記のコードでは、 count_dict[char] += 1 の行で次のエラーが発生してしまいます。 KeyError: 'h' これは変数 count_dict の存在しないキー \"h\" のカウントを増やそうとして、アクセスに失敗してエラーとなっています。 そこで、文字の出現回数のカウント処理は、次の2つの状況を考慮する必要があります。 (1) 出現した文字が変数 count_dict に既に存在する場合、カウントを増やす。\n\n(2) 出現した文字が変数 count_dict にまだ存在しない場合、カウントを 1 として保持する。 そこで文字 char が既に変数 count_dict のキーとして存在するかどうかを確認し、 if 文で処理を分岐します。\n\n辞書型の変数 count_dict に指定したキーが存在するかの確認は、 in 演算子を使用できます。 char = ' h ' count_dict = {} if char in count_dict : print ( f ' 指定したキー { char } は、辞書 { count_dict } に存在する ' ) else : print ( f ' 指定したキー { char } は、辞書 { count_dict } に存在しない ' ) この条件分岐処理に応じて、変数 count_dict のデータ更新を行います。\n\n文字 char に対して変数 count_dict のカウントを増やす場合は count_dict[char] += 1 を実行します。\n\n文字 char に対して変数 count_dict のカウントを 1 にする場合は count_dict[char] = 1 を実行します。 以上の処理を組み合わせることで、回答例のようなコードになります。 また、下記の分岐処理は別の方法で1つにまとめて実現することもできます。 (1) 出現した文字が変数 count_dict に既に存在する場合、カウントを増やす。\n\n(2) 出現した文字が変数 count_dict にまだ存在しない場合、カウントを 1 として保持する。 そもそもこの分岐は、変数 count_dict のキーが存在しない場合に発生するエラーを回避するためのものでした。\n\nキーが存在しないエラーを回避するためには、キーと値を設定すればよいのです。 つまり、出現した文字が変数 count_dict にまだ存在しない場合、カウントを 0 として保持します。\n\nその後、出現した文字に対する変数 count_dict のカウントを増やします。 これを実現するために、辞書型オブジェクトの setdefault メソッドを使用します。\n\nsetdefault メソッドは、辞書にキーが存在しない場合にデフォルト値を設定するメソッドです。\n\n逆に辞書にキーが存在する場合、 setdefault メソッドは辞書型オブジェクトの値を変更しません。 char = ' h ' count_dict = {} count_dict . setdefault ( char , 0 ) # h はキーに存在しないため、値が 0 のキー h が設定される count_dict [ char ] += 1 # 指定したキーが存在するため、、エラーにならない print ( count_dict ) # {'h': 1} が表示される count_dict . setdefault ( char , 0 ) # h はキーに存在するため、値は変更されない count_dict [ char ] += 1 # 2回目のカウントのため、値に 2 が設定される print ( count_dict ) # {'h': 2} が表示される 結果として、次のようなコードでも目的の出現回数データを取得することができます。 target_text = ' hello ' count_dict = {} for char in target_text : count_dict . setdefault ( char , 0 ) count_dict [ char ] += 1 print ( count_dict )\n\n問題 58 リストと文字列\n\n変数 target_list にリスト [1, 2, 3, None, 5, None, 7] を代入してください。\n\n変数 target_list の None でない要素を抽出し、文字列 \"&\" で結合した文字列 \"1&2&3&5&7\" を出力してください。\n\n回答例 target_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , None , 5 , None , 7 ] filtered_list = [ str ( item ) for item in target_list if item is not None ] result = ' & ' . join ( filtered_list ) print ( result )\n\n解説 この問題では、次の２つのリスト操作を行う必要があります。 (1) リストから None でない要素を抽出する。\n\n(2) リスト内の要素を文字列として結合する。 まず、(1) のリスト要素の抽出は、リスト内包表記を使用する方法が考えられます。\n\n次のコードはリスト内包表記を用いて、変数 target_list から None でない要素を抽出して表示します。 target_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , None , 5 , None , 7 ] filtered_list = [ item for item in target_list if item is not None ] print ( filtered_list ) 続いて、(2) の文字列結合は、文字列型オブジェクトの join メソッドを使う方法が考えられます。\n\n次のコードは join メソッドを用いて、変数 lst の要素を文字列 \"&\" で結合しようとしています。 filtered_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 ] result = ' & ' . join ( filtered_list ) # ここが問題 しかし、このコードを実行すると result = '&'.join(filtered_list) の部分で次のようなエラーが発生してしまいます。 TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, int found これは、文字列型のオブジェクトを指定するべき箇所で、整数型のオブジェクトが指定されている場合に発生するエラーです。\n\nつまり、文字列型のオブジェクトの join メソッドで指定するリストの要素は文字列型である必要があり、その条件を満たしていないのです。 上記のコードで変数 filtered_list に含まれる要素は 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 といった整数型の値となっています。\n\nこのままでは文字列型のオブジェクトの join メソッドによる結合処理が実行できません。 このような場合、変数 filtered_list に含まれる要素の型を文字列型に変換するのが良いでしょう。\n\nリスト型の変数内の要素を全て文字列型に変換する場合、 str 関数をリスト内包表記を使用する方法があります。 次のコードは、先ほどのコードに型変換の処理を追加し、エラーが発生しないように修正したものです。 filtered_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 ] str_list = [ str ( item ) for item in filtered_list ] result = ' & ' . join ( str_list ) print ( result ) 以上の内容を踏まえて、(1) と (2) の内容を続けて実行すると次のようになります。 target_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , None , 5 , None , 7 ] filtered_list = [ item for item in target_list if item is not None ] str_list = [ str ( item ) for item in filtered_list ] result = ' & ' . join ( str_list ) print ( result ) このコードは変数 target_list を操作し、目的の文字列 \"1&2&3&5&7\" を出力することができます。\n\n回答例では、2回のリスト内包表記を1行にまとめて処理しています。\n\n問題 59 繰り返しとエラー処理\n\n変数 lst にリスト [1, 2 , 3, None, 5] を代入してください。\n\n変数 lst の要素を for 文で順番に取得し、要素の値をそれぞれ 2 倍して print 関数で出力してください。\n\nただし、 try と except を使って型エラー TypeError を検知し、エラーが発生した場合はエラー内容を出力してください。\n\n回答例 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , None , 5 ] for x in lst : try : print ( x * 2 ) except TypeError as e : print ( e )\n\n解説 次のように for 文を使用すれば、変数 lst の内容を表示することができます。 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , None , 5 ] for x in lst : print ( x ) 問題文には「要素の値をそれぞれ 2 倍して」とあるので、繰り返し変数 x の値を 2 倍する処理を追加します。 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , None , 5 ] for x in lst : print ( x * 2 ) # エラーが発生する しかし、リスト lst に含まれている要素 None は数値ではないため、 2 倍するという操作を行おうとすると TypeError が発生します。\n\nそこで、この部分でエラーが発生しても処理を継続できるようにエラー処理を追加します。 ここで、 try 句の位置と for 文の位置関係も重要です。\n\n例えば、次のように for 文を含む形で try 句を記述してみましょう。 lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , None , 5 ] try : for x in lst : print ( x * 2 ) except TypeError as e : print ( e ) この場合、 for 文の繰り返し処理中にエラーが発生した時点で except 句の行に進みます。\n\nexcept 句の行は for 文の外にあるため、その時点で for 分の繰り返し処理を抜けてしまうことになります。\n\nつまり、今回の場合は None に対する処理中にエラーが発生し、次の 5 に対する繰り返し処理が行われないことになります。 回答例では for 文の中に try 句も except 句も含まれている状態です。\n\nこの場合、エラーが発生した場合はエラーの内容を表示し、次の繰り返し処理に進むことができます。\n\n問題 60 辞書のリスト\n\n次のリスト型の変数 employees から情報を取得し、 location_id が \"L01\" または \"L02\" に一致するデータの id と name を全て表示してください。\n\nemployees = [ { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' 田中 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L01 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0002 ' , ' name ' : ' 山田 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L02 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0003 ' , ' name ' : ' 小林 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L01 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0004 ' , ' name ' : ' 藤本 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L03 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0005 ' , ' name ' : ' 佐々木 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L02 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0006 ' , ' name ' : ' 松田 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L04 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0007 ' , ' name ' : ' 中村 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L01 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0008 ' , ' name ' : ' 石川 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L03 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0009 ' , ' name ' : ' 清水 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L05 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0010 ' , ' name ' : ' 近藤 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L02 ' } ]\n\n回答例 employees = [ { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' 田中 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L01 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0002 ' , ' name ' : ' 山田 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L02 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0003 ' , ' name ' : ' 小林 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L01 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0004 ' , ' name ' : ' 藤本 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L03 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0005 ' , ' name ' : ' 佐々木 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L02 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0006 ' , ' name ' : ' 松田 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L04 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0007 ' , ' name ' : ' 中村 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L01 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0008 ' , ' name ' : ' 石川 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L03 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0009 ' , ' name ' : ' 清水 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L05 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0010 ' , ' name ' : ' 近藤 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L02 ' } ] for employee in employees : if employee [ ' location_id ' ] in { ' L01 ' , ' L02 ' }: print ( employee [ ' id ' ], employee [ ' name ' ])\n\n解説 この問題では、リストの中に辞書が格納された構造のデータ employees を使用します。\n\nemployee は「従業員」や「社員」を意味する英単語であり、ここでは従業員の名前と勤務地を保持するサンプルデータとなっています。\n\n変数 employees はリストであり、その各要素は id 、 name 、 location_id というキーを持つ辞書データです。\n\n次のコードはリストの先頭の要素を取得し、辞書データにアクセスするものです。 employees = [ { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' 田中 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L01 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0002 ' , ' name ' : ' 山田 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L02 ' }, # 中略 ] employee = employees [ 0 ] print ( employee ) print ( employee [ ' id ' ], employee [ ' name ' ], employee [ ' location_id ' ]) この問題では、リスト employees の各要素が特定の条件を満たす場合に id と name を出力する必要があります。\n\nそのため、次のような for 文を用いた処理を行うことが考えられます。 employees = [ { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' 田中 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L01 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0002 ' , ' name ' : ' 山田 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L02 ' }, # 中略 ] for employee in employees : if True : print ( employee [ ' id ' ], employee [ ' name ' ]) この時点では条件を満たすかどうかの判定を無視しています。\n\nつまり、常に条件を満たすことを意味する True を判定条件にして、 if 文を if True: と記載しています。 そして、今回の問題での判定条件は location_id が \"L01\" または \"L02\" に一致するかどうかです。\n\n辞書型変数 employee の location_id キーの値は、既に確認したように employee['location_id'] で取得できます。\n\nこれが \"L01\" または \"L02\" に一致するという条件は、論理演算子 or を使えば実現できます。 employees = [ { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' 田中 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L01 ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0002 ' , ' name ' : ' 山田 ' , ' location_id ' : ' L02 ' }, # 中略 ] for employee in employees : if employee [ ' location_id ' ] == ' L01 ' or employee [ ' location_id ' ] == ' L02 ' : print ( employee [ ' id ' ], employee [ ' name ' ]) また、変数の値が \"L01\" または \"L02\" に一致するという条件は、 集合 {'L01', 'L02'} に含まれると言い換えることもできます。\n\n回答例では、集合を用いた条件分岐を行っています。\n\n関数\n\n問題 61 関数の定義\n\n呼び出されると \"Hello World\" と出力する関数 sample を定義し、その関数を3回呼び出してください。\n\n回答例 def sample (): print ( ' Hello World ' ) sample () sample () sample ()\n\n解説 Python では print 関数や len 関数などの組み込み関数が最初から提供されています。\n\nそのような組み込み関数とは別に、 def 文を用いて独自に関数を定義して使用することもできます。 def 文は if 文や for 文と同様、文末にコロン : を記載し、後に続く行はインデントされる必要があります。\n\ndef 文で定義した名前の関数を呼び出すことで、定義した処理を実行することができます。 回答例では、 def sample(): のように定義しているため、 sample() の形で関数を呼び出すことができます。\n\nこれにより、定義した処理 print('Hello World') が実行されます。 同じ処理を何度も行う場合に、関数を使えば処理内容を1箇所に集約できます。\n\n例えば、関数を使わずに回答例と同じ処理を行おうとすると、次のようになります。 print ( ' Hello World ' ) print ( ' Hello World ' ) print ( ' Hello World ' ) このコードでは \"Hello World\" という文字列を3回 print 関数に渡しています。\n\n一方で、関数を使った場合は \"Hello World\" の記述は1回で済みます。\n\nこのように、同じ処理を何度も行いたい場合、関数を用いることでコードが整理され、保守性や可読性が向上します。 また、処理を1度しか行わない場合でも、長い処理を分割して分かりやすく整理することもできます。 def main_process (): print ( ' ここで前処理を実行する ' ) def pre_process (): print ( ' ここでメイン処理を実行する ' ) def pro_process (): print ( ' ここで後処理を実行する ' ) # 前処理 main_process () # メイン処理 pre_process () # 後処理 pro_process ()\n\n問題 62 関数の引数\n\n引数 name を受け取り \"こんにちは、{name} さん\" と出力する関数 greet を定義し、引数に \"テスト\" を渡して実行してください。\n\nただし、出力する文字列内の \"{name}\" は引数で受け取った文字列 name の値に置き換えてください。\n\n回答例 def greet ( name ): print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name } さん ' ) greet ( ' テスト ' )\n\n解説 定義する関数に引数を設定することで、呼び出す際に指定した値を関数の処理内で使用することができます。 例えば、回答例では def greet(name): のように引数 name を指定して定義しています。\n\nこの関数は greet(name) の形で呼び出すことができ、変数 name の値は呼び出し時に指定した引数が処理に使われます\n\n今回の場合、定義した処理 print(f'こんにちは、{name} さん') は name の値が \"テスト\" として実行されます。\n\n結果として、\"こんにちは、テスト さん\" が出力されることになります。 引数を使えば、似たような処理を共通化して関数を定義することができます。\n\n例えば、次のコードでは名前に応じた分岐処理を関数化しています。 def greet_if_not_none ( name ): if name is None : print ( ' 名前が指定されませんでした ' ) else : print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name } さん ' ) greet_if_not_none ( ' 動作確認 ' ) greet_if_not_none ( ' 試験 ' ) greet_if_not_none ( None ) また、1つの関数に引数は複数設定することが可能です。\n\nこのとき、複数の引数を設定する場合、呼び出し時に指定する順序は定義した順序に合わせる必要があります。\n\n例えば、次のコードでは3つの引数を持つ関数を定義しています。 def greet_three ( name_1 , name_2 , name_3 ): print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_1 } さん ' ) print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_2 } さん ' ) print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_3 } さん ' ) greet_three ( ' 名前１ ' , ' 名前２ ' , ' 名前３ ' ) この関数の定義では3つの引数 name_1 、 name_2 、 name_3 がこの順序で指定されています。\n\n呼び出し時に \"名前１\"、\"名前２\"、名前３\" の順序で指定しているため、 name_1='名前１' 、 name_2='名前２' 、 name_3='名前３' が対応します。\n\n問題 63 関数の戻り値\n\n引数 a と b を受け取り、それらの和を返す関数 add を定義してください。\n\nさらに、引数に 1 と 2 を渡して実行し、結果を出力してください。\n\n回答例 def add ( a , b ): return a + b x = add ( 1 , 2 ) print ( x )\n\n解説 def 文の中で return 文を使うと、関数からの戻り値を返します。\n\n関数の呼び出し元で戻り値を取得し、その後の処理で使用できます。\n\nreturn 文がない関数の戻り値は None になります。 return 文が実行された時点で、その関数の処理は終了します。\n\n例えば、次の関数でログ出力を意図した print 関数は実行されません。 def add ( a , b ): return a + b print ( f ' a= { a } , b= { b } , a+b= { a + b } ' ) # この行は処理されない x = add ( 1 , 2 ) print ( x ) ログ出力を行う場合は、次のように return 文の前に処理する必要があります。 def add ( a , b ): print ( f ' a= { a } , b= { b } , a+b= { a + b } ' ) return a + b x = add ( 1 , 2 ) print ( x ) 引数や戻り値を設定した関数を使うことで、複雑な処理を整理することができます。\n\n関数は次の3つの構成要素から成り立っており、どのようなシステムも関数を組み合わせて構築されているとみなすことができます。 (1) 引数： 関数に入力する値\n\n(2) 処理： 関数が動作することで与える影響\n\n(3) 戻り値： 関数が出力する値\n\n問題 64 デフォルト引数\n\nデフォルト値 \"ゲスト\" を設定した引数 name を持ち、\"ようこそ、{name} さん\" と出力する関数 welcome_message を定義してください。\n\n定義した関数 welcome_message を次の2通りで実行してください。\n\n(1) 引数を指定せずに呼び出す\n\n(2) 引数に \"管理者\" を指定して呼び出す\n\n回答例 def welcome_message ( name = ' ゲスト ' ): print ( f ' ようこそ、 { name } さん ' ) welcome_message () welcome_message ( ' 管理者 ' )\n\n解説 関数の引数にはデフォルト値を設定することができます。\n\nデフォルト値は、関数の呼び出しで引数が渡されなかった場合に使われる既定の値です。\n\n引数にデフォルト値を設定するには、関数の定義で 引数名=デフォルト値 の形で引数を記述します。 回答例では、 def welcome_message(name='ゲスト'): のように定義しています。\n\n引数 name を指定せずにこの関数を呼び出した場合、引数 name の値は \"ゲスト\" として処理が行われます。\n\nもちろん、引数を指定して関数を呼び出した場合、引数 name の値は指定した値で処理が行われます。 ただし、関数に複数の引数を設定する場合、デフォルト引数の後にデフォルト値を持たない引数を設定することはできません。\n\n例えば、次のようにデフォルト引数が前にあると構文エラーになります。 def greet_ng ( name_1 = ' ゲスト ' , name_2 , name_3 ): # エラーが発生する print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_1 } さん ' ) print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_2 } さん ' ) print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_3 } さん ' ) 一方で、次のように3つ目の引数のみデフォルト値を指定すればエラーは発生しません。 def greet_ok_1 ( name_1 , name_2 , name_3 = ' ゲスト ' ): print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_1 } さん ' ) print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_2 } さん ' ) print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_3 } さん ' ) また、次のように全ての引数にデフォルト値を指定してもエラーは発生しません。 def greet_ok_2 ( name_1 = ' ゲスト ' , name_2 = ' ゲスト ' , name_3 = ' ゲスト ' ): print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_1 } さん ' ) print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_2 } さん ' ) print ( f ' こんにちは、 { name_3 } さん ' ) このように、デフォルト値を指定した引数を関数に定義する場合、他の引数の後に配置する必要があります。\n\nこれは引数が省略されて呼び出された際に、どの引数が省略されているか判断するシステムの仕組みによるものです。\n\n問題 65 可変長引数とキーワード引数\n\n可変長引数 args とキーワード引数 kwargs を設定した関数 print_args を定義し、可変長引数とキーワード引数を print 関数で表示する処理を作成してください。\n\nまた、作成した関数を用いて print_args('A', 'B', key1='X', key2='Y') を実行してください。\n\n回答例 def print_args ( * args , ** kwargs ): print ( args ) print ( kwargs ) print_args ( ' A ' , ' B ' , key1 = ' X ' , key2 = ' Y ' )\n\n解説 この問題では、次の2つの機能を使っています。 可変長引数： 複数の引数を指定された順序のタプル型で受け取ります。 * 記号を用いて定義します。\n\nキーワード引数： キーと値で指定された引数を辞書型で受け取ります。 ** 記号を用いて定義します。 回答例では、受け取った引数をそのまま print 関数で表示しており、結果は次のようになります。 ('A', 'B')\n\n{'key1': 'X', 'key2': 'Y'} これらはタプル型と辞書型の変数として扱えるため、次のように for 文で1つずつ使用することも可能です。 def print_args ( * args , ** kwargs ): for x in args : print ( x ) for key , value in kwargs . items (): print ( key , value ) print_args ( ' A ' , ' B ' , key1 = ' X ' , key2 = ' Y ' ) このように、可変長引数やキーワード引数を使うことで、柔軟で再利用しやすい関数を作ることができます。\n\nクラス\n\n問題 66 クラスの作成\n\n次の条件を満たすクラス SimpleClass を定義し、引数に \"サンプル\" を指定してオブジェクトを初期化してください。\n\n(1) 初期化を行う際に1つの引数 name を受け取る\n\n(2) 初期化処理で \"名前が {name} のオブジェクトを作成しました\" と出力する\n\n回答例 class SimpleClass : def __init__ ( self , name ): print ( f ' 名前が { name } のオブジェクトを作成しました ' ) x = SimpleClass ( ' サンプル ' )\n\n解説 クラスは、独自のデータ構造とそれに関連する操作を定義し、新しいデータ型として利用できるようにする仕組みです。\n\nその定義に従ってデータ型のオブジェクトを作成することができ、変数に格納して扱うことができます。 例えば、 str や int 、 list などは、Python が最初から提供している組み込みクラスです。\n\n文字列 \"text\" は str クラスのオブジェクトであり、数値 1 は int クラスのオブジェクトです。\n\nstr クラスのオブジェクトは split メソッドや join メソッドなどの操作が定義されています。 このように、特定の目的でデータを保持し、それに関連した操作を定義するのがクラスです。\n\nクラスは class 文を使って次のように定義します。 class クラス名 : # 変数やメソッドの定義をここに記述する 定義したクラスのオブジェクトを初期化する処理は __init__ 関数で定義します class クラス名 : def __init__ ( self , 初期化引数 ): # 初期化の処理をここに記述する __init__ 関数の先頭の引数 self は、そのクラスのオブジェクト自身を指す変数です。\n\n初期化処理でオブジェクトのデータやメソッドにアクセスするための変数です。\n\n厳密には self という名前でなくとも動作しますが、慣習として self とするのが一般的です。 クラスのオブジェクトを作成する際に指定する引数は、 self の後で定義します。\n\nそして、クラス名を用いて クラス名(初期化引数) の形でオブジェクトを作成することができます。\n\n次の例はクラス Sample を定義し、初期化用の引数として name を設定しています。 class Sample : def __init__ ( self , name ): print ( name ) x = Sample ( ' サンプル ' ) この例の print 関数の出力内容をf文字列で整形するように修正し、クラス名を問題文で指定されたものに変更すれば、回答例のようなクラスになります。\n\n問題 67 メソッドの作成\n\n前の問題で作成したクラス SimpleClass に次の２つの機能を追加してください。\n\n(1) クラス SimpleClass のオブジェクト初期化処理において、引数 name で指定された値をインスタンス変数 name で保持する。\n\n(2) メソッド print_name が実行されると、インスタンス変数 name の値を print 関数で出力する。\n\n回答例 class SimpleClass : def __init__ ( self , name ): self . name = name print ( f ' { self . name } を登録しました ' ) def print_name ( self ): print ( self . name )\n\n解説 インスタンス変数とは、クラスのオブジェクトが保持するデータのことです。\n\nそのクラスのオブジェクト自身を指す変数 self を用いて、 self.変数名 の形で扱います。 例えば、次のコードではインスタンス変数 name に 引数で指定された値 name を代入しています。 class Sample : def __init__ ( self , name ): self . name = name この例では、インスタンス変数と引数とで同じ名前 name を使用しています。\n\nこれらは、オブジェクト自身を指す変数 self の有無で区別します。 この問題で指定された機能 (1) は、引数で指定された値をインスタンス変数で保持するというものです。\n\n上記の例では引数で指定された値 name を インスタンス変数 self.name に代入して保持しており、(1) の機能を満たしています。 このとき、クラスの定義の外からもインスタンス変数にアクセスすることが可能です。\n\n例えば、オブジェクト x のインスタンス変数 name にアクセスするには、 x.name のように記述します。 class Sample : def __init__ ( self , name ): self . name = name x = Sample ( ' サンプル ' ) print ( x . name ) # サンプル が表示される 続いて、機能 (2) で指定されたメソッド print_name を定義します。\n\nクラスにメソッドを定義する場合、 class 文の中で def 文を使用して関数を定義します。 class クラス名 : def __init__ ( self , 初期化引数 ): # 初期化の処理をここに記述する def メソッド名 ( self , メソッド引数 ): # メソッドの処理をここに記述する このとき、 __init__ 関数もクラスに定義されたメソッドであり、同じ構文に従っています。\n\nメソッド名が __init__ の関数が、自動的に初期化処理で呼ばれる仕組みとなっています。 クラスにメソッドを定義すると、そのクラスのオブジェクト x は x.メソッド名() の形でメソッドを実行できます。\n\n次のコードは、インスタンス変数 name の値を print 関数で出力するメソッド print_name を定義しています。 class Sample : def __init__ ( self , name ): self . name = name def print_name ( self ): print ( self . name ) x = Sample ( ' サンプル ' ) x . print_name () # サンプル が表示される これにより問題文で指定された機能を実装することができました。\n\nここで実装した機能を前問のクラス SimpleClass に実装すれば、回答例のようになります。 また、この問題でメソッドと呼んでいるものは、厳密にはインスタンスメソッドと呼びます。\n\nインスタンスとは、クラスで定義されたデータ型のオブジェクトのことです。\n\nそしてインスタンスメソッドは、そのクラスのオブジェクトが使用できる関数です。 インスタンスメソッドの特徴は、オブジェクトが使用できるという点です。\n\nそしてオブジェクトは、オブジェクトごとにインスタンス変数を保持することができます。 次の例では２つのオブジェクトを作成し、それぞれ異なるデータを保持していることを確認します。 class Sample : def __init__ ( self , name ): self . name = name def print_name ( self ): print ( self . name ) x = Sample ( ' サンプル-X ' ) y = Sample ( ' サンプル-Y ' ) x . print_name () # サンプル-X が表示される y . print_name () # サンプル-Y が表示される メソッドには、インスタンスメソッドの他にクラスメソッドやスタティックメソッドと呼ばれるものが存在します。\n\nただし、インスタンスメソッドのことを指して、単にメソッドと表現することも多いです。 クラスメソッドは定義したクラス自体に対して使用するメソッドで、詳しくは次の問題で扱います。\n\nスタティックメソッドはクラスの状態と関係のないメソッドです。\n\n基本的に通常の関数で代用できるため、スタティックメソッドの詳細は扱いません。\n\n問題 68 クラスメソッドの作成\n\n前の問題で作成したクラス SimpleClass に次の２つの機能を追加してください。\n\n(1) クラス SimpleClass のインスタンスが作成された回数をクラス変数 count で保持する。\n\n(2) クラスメソッド print_count が実行されると、クラス変数 count の値を print 関数で表示する。\n\n回答例 class SimpleClass : count = 0 def __init__ ( self , name ): SimpleClass . count += 1 self . name = name print ( f ' { self . name } を登録しました ' ) @classmethod def print_count ( cls ): print ( cls . count ) def print_name ( self ): print ( self . name )\n\n解説 クラス変数はクラス全体で共有される変数です。\n\nオブジェクトごとに異なるデータを保持するインスタンス変数と違い、クラスで共通した１つのデータを保持する変数です。\n\nクラス変数は、クラスを定義する class 文内に直接記述された変数で定義します class Sample : value = ' クラス変数 ' # class 文内に直接記述されたクラス変数 クラスの定義内であっても、関数内に記述された変数はクラス変数として扱われません。 class Sample : def __init__ ( self ): value = ' 変数 ' # class 文内に直接記述されていないため、クラス変数ではない クラス変数は全てのインスタンスで共有されており、 クラス名.変数名 のように指定してアクセスすることができます。 class Sample : value = ' クラス変数 ' def __init__ ( self ): print ( Sample . value ) # クラス名.変数名の形でクラス変数にアクセスする x = Sample () # 初期化処理により、__init__ 関数内の print が実行される print ( Sample . value ) # クラス名.変数名の形でクラス変数にアクセスする この問題で指定された機能 (1) は、インスタンスが作成された回数をクラス変数で保持するものです。\n\nこの機能を作成するため、クラス変数 count の初期値を 0 に設定し、インスタンスが作成された際にカウントアップする仕組みにします。 次のコードはインスタンスが作成された回数をクラス変数 count で保持する仕組みを実装し、動作を確認しています。 class Sample : count = 0 def __init__ ( self ): Sample . count += 1 print ( Sample . count ) # 0 が表示される x = Sample () # 初期化処理により、__init__ 関数内の処理でクラス変数 count が更新される print ( Sample . count ) # 1 が表示される 続いて、機能 (2) で指定されたクラスメソッド print_count を定義します。\n\nクラスメソッドを定義する場合、メソッド定義に @classmethod デコレータを追加します。 class クラス名 : @classmethod def クラスメソッド名 ( cls , クラスメソッド引数 ): # クラスメソッドの処理をここに記述する デコレータは関数やメソッドに特別な機能を追加するための仕組みです。\n\n@classmethod デコレータは、メソッドの処理をクラス全体に関連付ける機能を追加します。 また、クラスメソッドの先頭の引数 cls は、そのクラス自身を指す変数です。\n\nインスタンスメソッドにおいて self という名前が使われるのと同じく、クラスメソッドにおいては cls という名前を使用するのが一般的です。 クラスメソッドではクラス自身を指す変数 cls を用いて cls.クラス変数名 でクラス変数にアクセスできます。\n\n次のコードは、クラス変数 count の値を print 関数で表示するクラスメソッド print_count を定義しています。 class Sample : count = 0 @classmethod def print_count ( cls ): print ( cls . count ) Sample . print_count () # 0 が表示される このクラスメソッドと、インスタンスが作成された回数を保持する仕組みを組み合わせると次のようになります。 class Sample : count = 0 def __init__ ( self ): Sample . count += 1 @classmethod def print_count ( cls ): print ( cls . count ) Sample . print_count () # 0 が表示される x = Sample () # 初期化処理により、__init__ 関数内の処理でクラス変数 count が更新される Sample . print_count () # 1 が表示される 前問で作成した SimpleClass にこのような仕組みを実装すると、回答例のようなコードになります。\n\n自作ライブラリ\n\n問題 69 自作モジュールの使用\n\n次のような関数 sample が定義されたモジュール import_test を作成してください。\n\nそのモジュールを別のモジュールからインポートし、 sample 関数を呼び出してください。\n\ndef sample (): print ( ' Hello World ' )\n\n回答例 import import_test import_test . sample ()\n\n解説 まず、問題で指定された関数 sample() を定義するモジュールを作成します。\n\nPython では、コードを記述した Python ファイルが1つのモジュールとして機能します。\n\nそのときのモジュール名はファイル名から定まり、拡張子 \".py\" を除いた部分がモジュール名として認識されます。 今回の問題ではモジュールの内容が指定されているため、問題文にある sample() 関数の内容をそのままテキストファイルに保存します。\n\nモジュール名は import_test と指定されているため、保存するファイルのファイル名は \"import_test.py\" とする必要があります。\n\nこのとき、ファイル名の末尾の拡張子 \".py\" まで正しく指定する必要があります。 以上の操作で、 sample 関数 が定義されたモジュールの作成は完了です。 次に、このモジュールをインポートして呼び出すためのスクリプトファイルを作成します。\n\nモジュールをインポートするには、 import キーワードを用いて import モジュール名 という処理を記述します。\n\nこの問題でインポートするモジュールは import_test となっているので、インポートの処理は次のようになります。 import import_test この処理を実行すると、Python は指定された名前のモジュールを探して処理中のスクリプトに読み込みます。 モジュール内で定義されている関数を呼び出すには、 モジュール名.関数名() のように記述します。\n\n今回の場合、 import_test モジュールの sample() 関数を呼び出すため、次のような記述を行います。 import import_test import_test . sample () このコードを実行すると import_test モジュールの sample 関数が動作し、 print 関数によって \"Hello World\" が出力されるはずです。\n\nこのコードがこの問題の回答例となっています。 この問題で作成するコードはシンプルですが、実行してみると期待通りに動作しない可能性があります。\n\nそのような場合、どのようなエラーが発生しているのかを確認して修正することになります。 よくあるエラーの原因は、インポートしようとしているファイルを Python が見つけられないというものです。 例えば、インポート対象のファイル \"import_test.py\" は、インポートする側のPythonスクリプトと同じフォルダに格納する必要があります。\n\n他のフォルダに格納している場合にインポートする方法もありますが、そのための設定が必要です。 また、インポートするファイルが見つかっても、インポートに失敗してエラーが発生することもあります。\n\n例えば、インポート対象のファイル \"import_test.py\" にインデントの誤りがあり構文エラーが発生することもあります。 もし期待通りに動作しない場合、出力されているエラーメッセージを確認し、エラーの原因を調査してください。\n\n問題 70 自作ライブラリの使用\n\n前問で作成したモジュール import_test を含むライブラリ library_test を作成してください。\n\nそのライブラリのモジュール import_test を別のモジュールからインポートし、 sample 関数を呼び出してください。\n\n回答例 from library_test import import_test import_test . sample ()\n\n解説 ライブラリは複数のモジュールをまとめたものであり、モジュールを含むフォルダによって構成されます。\n\nそのときのライブラリ名はフォルダ名から定まり、フォルダ名がそのままライブラリ名として認識されます。 この問題ではライブラリ library_test を作成するため、\"library_test\" という名前のフォルダを作成します。\n\n前問で作成したファイル \"import_test.py\" は、作成したフォルダ \"library_test\" 内に格納します。 以上の操作で、\"library_test\" フォルダを library_test ライブラリとして使用できます。\n\nただし、本来 Python は \"_init_.py\" という名前のファイルが存在するフォルダをライブラリとして扱います。\n\nこれはライブラリをインポート際の初期化処理を記述するためのファイルで、初期化処理が必要なければ空白のファイルになります。\n\nこのファイルが存在しない場合も動作しますが、空白の __init__.py ファイルを作成することを推奨します。 また、ライブラリをインポートして呼び出すためには、前問のコードを少しだけ変更する必要があります。\n\nライブラリからモジュールをインポートするには、 from キーワードと import キーワードを用いて次のように記述します。 from ライブラリ名 import モジュール名 この問題ではライブラリ library_test からモジュール import_test をインポートするので、次のようなコードになります。 from library_test import import_test このコードで前問と同じく import_test モジュールをインポートできます。\n\nしたがって、 import_test モジュールに定義された関数 sample も同様に実行できます。 from library_test import import_test import_test . sample () これがこの問題の回答例となっています。 また、インポートの処理は他の書き方で記述することもできます。\n\n次のコードは、 from キーワードを使用せず、モジュール名の前にライブラリ名を指定する方法でモジュールを読み込んでいます。 import library_test.import_test library_test . import_test . sample () この書き方では、インポートの処理だけでなく、 sample 関数呼び出しの際にもライブラリ名 library_test を指定する必要があります。\n\nマジック変数\n\n問題 71 Python ファイルのパス\n\nマジック変数 __file__ を使用して、実行している Python ファイルのパスを表示してください。\n\n回答例 print ( __file__ )\n\n解説 変数 __file__ は、実行中の Python ファイルのファイルパスを表す特殊な変数です。\n\nこのような変数はマジック変数と呼ばれています。 マジック変数 __file__ を使うと、実行中の Python ファイルを基準にしたパスを作成することができます。\n\n問題 72 実行中モジュールのパッケージ\n\nマジック変数 __package__ を使用して、実行している Python ファイルが属しているパッケージ名を表示してください。\n\n回答例 print ( __package__ )\n\n解説 変数 __package__ は、モジュールがどのパッケージに属しているかを示すマジック変数です。\n\nここでパッケージとは、複数のモジュールをまとめて管理するフォルダ構造を指します。\n\n似たような言葉にライブラリがありますが、ライブラリの方が広い概念です。\n\nライブラリは特定の機能を提供するモジュールやパッケージの集合を指し、ツールとしての役割に注目した概念です。 ライブラリとして他のモジュールからインポートされた場合、変数 __package__ は所属するパッケージ名になります。\n\n一方で、スクリプトが直接実行された場合、変数 __package__ は None もしくは空文字列になります。\n\n問題 73 実行中のモジュール\n\n現在実行中の Python ファイルがメインモジュールとして直接実行されたかどうかを判定し、直接実行された場合に \"直接実行\" と出力してください。\n\n回答例 if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : print ( ' 直接実行 ' )\n\n解説 変数 __name__ はモジュールの名前を表すマジック変数です。\n\nスクリプトが直接実行された場合、 __name__ は '__main__' になります。\n\n一方で、ライブラリとして他のモジュールからインポートされた際は、値はそのモジュール名になります。 このマジック変数 __name__ は、回答例のように直接実行された際の条件分岐のために使用されます。\n\n標準ライブラリ\n\n問題 74 標準ライブラリの使用\n\nimport キーワードを使って標準ライブラリの datetime モジュールをインポートしてください。\n\ndatetime モジュールの datetime クラスのクラスメソッド now を実行し、取得した現在時刻のオブジェクトを print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 import datetime now = datetime . datetime . now () print ( now )\n\n解説 この問題で使用する datetime モジュールは日付と時刻を扱うための標準ライブラリです。\n\ndatetime モジュールには datetime クラスが含まれています。\n\nモジュール名とクラス名が一致しているため、混同しないように注意が必要です。 この問題では標準ライブラリのインポートを行いますが、自作ライブラリのインポートと同様に import キーワードを使用します。 import datetime 回答例では datetime.datetime でクラスを指定し、そのクラスの now メソッドを呼び出しています。\n\nクラスメソッド now は現在のシステム日時を持ったオブジェクトを返します。\n\n問題 75 from と import\n\nfrom キーワードを使って datetime モジュールから date クラスをインポートしてください。\n\ndate クラスの today メソッドで現在日付のオブジェクトを取得し、 print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 from datetime import date today = date . today () print ( today )\n\n解説 from キーワードを使うことで、特定のクラスや関数を指定してインポートできます。\n\n前問のようにモジュール全体をインポートした場合は モジュール名.クラス名 という形でクラスを指定しますが、 from キーワードでクラスをインポートした場合はクラス名を直接指定できます。 from datetime import date today = date . today () # モジュール名の指定は不要 この問題で使用する date クラスは日付を扱うクラスです。\n\n前問で使用した datetime クラスは日付と時刻を扱いますが、 date クラスの場合は時刻を扱いません。 date クラスのクラスメソッド today は、現在のシステム日付を持ったオブジェクトを返します。\n\n問題 76 モジュールの別名インポート\n\nas キーワードを用いて datetime モジュールを別名 dt という名前でインポートしてください。\n\ndatetime クラスのクラスメソッド now を実行し、取得した現在時刻のオブジェクトを print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 import datetime as dt now = dt . datetime . now () print ( now )\n\n解説 as キーワードを使うことで、インポートするモジュールに別名を付けることができます。\n\n短く分かりやすい別名を付けることで、モジュールの指定を簡潔に記述することができます。 回答例のコードではモジュール名 datetime を別名 dt で記述しています。\n\nこれにより モジュール名.クラス名.関数名 のような長い指定を簡潔にすることができます。\n\nファイル操作\n\n問題 77 ファイルの存在確認\n\n標準ライブラリ pathlib モジュールから Path クラスをインポートしてください。\n\nカレントディレクトリに \"test.txt\" というファイルが存在するかどうかを判定し、結果を True または False で出力してください。\n\n回答例 from pathlib import Path filepath = Path ( ' test.txt ' ) print ( filepath . exists ())\n\n解説 カレントディレクトリとは、現在プログラムが動作しているディレクトリを意味します。\n\n詳細は Python スクリプトの実行方法 を参照してください。 Pythonではファイルやディレクトリのパスを扱うための標準ライブラリとして pathlib モジュールが用意されています。\n\nまた、標準モジュール os でもパスを扱うことは可能ですが、 pathlib の方が可読性が高く直感的な記述が可能と言われています。 Path クラスはファイルやディレクトリのパスを扱うためのクラスで、パスに関連する便利なメソッドが多数定義されています。\n\nこの問題では Path オブジェクトの exists メソッドを使って、そのパスが実際に存在するかどうかを取得します。 Path クラスのオブジェクトを作成するには、パスを表す文字列 x を使って Path(x) と記述します。\n\n次のコードは変数 x の部分に文字列オブジェクト 'test.txt' をそのまま指定して Path オブジェクトを作成しています。 from pathlib import Path filepath = Path ( ' test.txt ' ) この処理で取得した Path オブジェクトに exists() メソッドを使うと、そのファイルやディレクトリが存在するかを True または False で返します。\n\n回答例では、その結果を print 関数でそのまま表示しています。\n\n問題 78 ファイルへの書き込み\n\n文字列 \"Hello, World!\" を Python でカレントディレクトリのファイル \"test.txt\" に書き込んでください。\n\nただし、同名のファイルが存在する場合、既存のテキストデータを無視して書き込んだ値で上書きしてください。\n\n回答例 with open ( ' test.txt ' , ' w ' ) as file : file . write ( ' Hello, World! ' )\n\n解説 Pythonでファイルを操作するには、組み込み関数 open を使用します。\n\nopen 関数は、ファイルを開いてファイルオブジェクトを返します。\n\n次のコードはカレントディレクトリの \"test.txt\" を開いています。 file = open ( ' test.txt ' , ' w ' ) file . close () ファイルへの書き込みを行う場合、ファイル名とモードを引数に指定して open 関数を使用します。\n\nこの例では、ファイル名 \"test.txt\" と書き込みモード \"w\" を指定しています。\n\n設定可能なモードには次のようなものがあります。 モード 概要 説明 \"r\" 読み込み ファイルの内容を読み取るためのモード。ファイルが存在しない場合はエラーになります。 \"w\" 書き込み 新しいファイルを作成するか、既存ファイルの内容を上書きします。 \"a\" 追記 既存ファイルの末尾にデータを追加します。ファイルが存在しない場合は新規作成されます。 \"x\" 新規作成 新しいファイルを作成します。ファイルが既に存在する場合はエラーになります。 さらにプラス記号 \"+\" を追加すると、読み書き両方を許可するモードになります。 モード 説明 \"r+\" 既存のファイルを 読み書き可能 にする。ファイルが存在しない場合はエラー。 \"w+\" ファイルが存在しない場合は 新規作成、存在する場合は 内容を上書きし、読み書き可能 にする。 \"a+\" ファイルが存在しない場合は 新規作成、存在する場合は 末尾に追記しつつ、読み書き可能 にする。 \"x+\" 新規作成のみ許可 し、読み書きも可能。ファイルが既に存在するとエラー。 モードの指定を省略した場合、読み込み \"r\" として処理されます。\n\n今回の問題のように書き込みを行う場合には、モードの指定を省略できません。 また、 open 関数を使用してファイルを開いた場合、処理を抜けるまでに close メソッドを呼び出してファイルを閉じる必要があります。\n\nもしファイルが閉じられていない場合、他のプログラムからファイルにアクセスできなくなるといった問題が発生する可能性があります。 上記のコードを実行すると、カレントディレクトリの \"test.txt\" を開き、上書き保存して閉じます。\n\nもしカレントディレクトリに \"test.txt\" が存在しなかった場合は、新規ファイルが \"test.txt\" という名前で作成されます。\n\n逆に、カレントディレクトリに \"test.txt\" が存在した場合、空白のデータで上書きが行われます。 ファイルへの書き込み処理には、 write メソッドを使用します。\n\n次のコードは、この問題で指定された文字列 \"Hello, World!\" を書き込む処理を追加したものです。 file = open ( ' test.txt ' , ' w ' ) file . write ( ' Hello, World! ' ) file . close () このコードで、この問題で指定された処理を実現することができます。\n\nしかし、例えば write メソッドの処理中にエラーが発生した場合、上記のコードでは close メソッドが実行されず、ファイルが閉じられない可能性があります。 そこで、そのような問題を回避するため、 with 句を使用することが一般的です。\n\nwith 句はリソースの管理を自動化するための構文であり、 open 関数と組み合わせるとファイルを自動的に閉じることができます。\n\nwith 句は if 文や try 句等と同様、文末にコロン : を記載し、後に続く行はインデントされる必要があります。 次のコードは、上記のコードを with 句を使って記述したものです。 with open ( ' test.txt ' , ' w ' ) as file : file . write ( ' Hello, World! ' ) このコードでは、 open 関数で開いたファイルオブジェクトを as キーワードで指定した変数 file に割り当てています。\n\nwrite メソッドを使用した書き込み処理は上記のコードと同様ですが、 close メソッドは不要になります。 このコードが回答例となっています。\n\n問題 79 ファイルへの追記\n\n文字列 \"Hello, World!\" を Python でカレントディレクトリのファイル \"test.txt\" に書き込んでください。\n\nただし、同名のファイルが存在する場合は既存のテキストデータを保持し、末尾に追記する形で書き込んでください。\n\n回答例 with open ( ' test.txt ' , ' a ' ) as file : file . write ( ' Hello, World! ' )\n\n解説 基本的な操作は前問と同じです。\n\nopen() 関数で追記モード \"a\" を指定することで、既存データを残して書き込む処理を実現できます。 回答例のコードでは、末尾に追加する文字は改行されません。\n\nこのコードを複数回実行した場合、末尾の1行に連続して追記されることに注意が必要です。 もし末尾の行を改行して、新たな行に追記を行う場合は次のようになります。 with open ( ' test.txt ' , ' a ' ) as file : file . write ( '\n\nHello, World! ' ) このコードでは、改行を意味するエスケープシーケンス '\n\n' を使用して改行するように指定しています。\n\n問題 80 ファイルの読み取り\n\nカレントディレクトリにあるファイル \"test.txt\" の内容を読み取り、 print 関数で出力してください。\n\nただし、ファイルが存在しない場合は \"ファイルが存在しません\" と出力してください。\n\n回答例 try : with open ( ' test.txt ' , ' r ' ) as file : content = file . read () print ( content ) except FileNotFoundError : print ( ' ファイルが存在しません ' )\n\n解説 open() 関数で読み込みモード \"r\" を指定することで、ファイルを読み取り用に開きます。\n\nファイルを読み取る場合もファイルを閉じる処理が必要ですが、 with 句を使えば close メソッドは不要です。 ファイルの読み取り処理は read メソッドを使用します。\n\n次のコードはファイルから読み取ったテキストを変数 content に格納して出力しています。 with open ( ' test.txt ' , ' r ' ) as file : content = file . read () print ( content ) この問題では、ファイルが存在しない場合の処理が指定されています。\n\nファイルの存在確認には pathlib モジュールを使用する方法もありますが、回答例ではエラー処理で実装しています。 エラー処理を使用した実装であれば、次のように他のエラーに対しても対応することが可能です。 try : with open ( ' test.txt ' , ' r ' , encoding = ' utf-8 ' ) as file : content = file . read () print ( content ) except FileNotFoundError : print ( ' エラー: ファイルが存在しません。 ' ) except PermissionError : print ( ' エラー: ファイルの読み込み権限がありません。 ' ) except UnicodeDecodeError : print ( ' エラー: ファイルのエンコードが適切でないため、読み込めません。 ' ) except Exception as e : print ( f ' 予期しないエラーが発生しました: { e } ' )\n\n問題 81 ファイルの削除\n\nカレントディレクトリにあるファイル \"test.txt\" を削除してください。\n\nただし、ファイルが存在しない場合は「ファイルが存在しません」と表示してください。\n\n回答例 from pathlib import Path filepath = Path ( ' test.txt ' ) if filepath . exists (): filepath . unlink () else : print ( ' ファイルが存在しません ' )\n\n解説 Python でファイルを削除する方法はいくつかありますが、その１つが Path オブジェクトの unlink メソッドを使う方法です。\n\nunlink メソッドは、該当の Path オブジェクトに対応するファイルを削除します。\n\nただし、フォルダを削除することはできないため、フォルダを削除する場合は別の方法を使用する必要があります。 他にも、 Path オブジェクトは便利なメソッドが多数用意されています。\n\nこの問題ではファイルが存在しない場合の処理を指定されているため、 Path オブジェクトの exists メソッドの結果で条件分岐しています。\n\n問題 82 csvのリスト型書き込み\n\n標準ライブラリの csv モジュールをインポートしてください。\n\n次の変数 lst の情報をカレントディレクトリのテキストファイル \"test.csv\" にカンマで区切られたcsv形式で書き込んでください。\n\nlst = [ [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], ]\n\n回答例 import csv lst = [ [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], ] with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' w ' , newline = '' ) as file : writer = csv . writer ( file ) writer . writerows ( lst )\n\n解説 csv モジュールを使用してファイル書き込みを行う場合、 open 関数で取得したファイルオブジェクトを指定して書き込み用オブジェクトを作成します。\n\ncsv モジュールの writer 関数は、リスト型データをファイルオブジェクトへ書き込むためのオブジェクトを作成します。 この書き込み用オブジェクトの書き込み用メソッド writerows は、2次元リストを一度にまとめて書き込みます。\n\n今回の問題では書き込む内容が2次元リストで与えられているため、回答例では writerows メソッドを使用しています。 このとき、 open 関数を使用する際の引数で newline を指定することを推奨します。\n\n例えば、次のように newline を指定せずに open 関数を使用した場合、出力されるファイルに意図しない空行が挿入されることがあります。 import csv lst = [ [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], ] with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' w ' ) as file : writer = csv . writer ( file ) writer . writerows ( lst ) また、書き込み用オブジェクトの書き込み用メソッド writerow メソッドは、1次元リストを指定して1行ずつ書き込むことができます。\n\n例えば、次のコードは回答例のコードと同様の結果を得ることができます。 import csv lst = [ [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], ] with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' w ' , newline = '' ) as file : writer = csv . writer ( file ) for row in lst : writer . writerow ( row )\n\n問題 83 csvのリスト型読み込み\n\n標準ライブラリの csv モジュールをインポートしてください。\n\nカレントディレクトリのcsv形式のテキストファイル \"test.csv\" を読み込み、カンマ部分で分割したリストを1行ずつ出力してください。\n\n回答例 import csv with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' r ' , newline = '' ) as file : reader = csv . reader ( file ) for row in reader : print ( row )\n\n解説 csv モジュールを使用してファイル読み込みを行う場合、 open 関数で取得したファイルオブジェクトを指定して読み込み用オブジェクトを作成します。\n\ncsv モジュールの reader 関数は、ファイルオブジェクトからリスト型でテキストを読み込むためのオブジェクトを作成します。\n\nこの読み込み用オブジェクトはテキストファイルの行データを要素として順番に取り出すことができるため、 for 文と組み合わせて使用することができます。 import csv with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' r ' , newline = '' ) as file : reader = csv . reader ( file ) for row in reader : print ( row ) このコードでは、 for 文の繰り返し処理が動く際にファイルから行データを取得する処理が動きます。\n\n変数 reader はファイルを読み込むオブジェクトであり、テキストファイルのテキストを保持しているわけではありません。\n\n結果として、もしファイルが非常に大きなサイズのものであっても、1行ずつ処理するため問題が発生しにくいです。 一方で、次のように読み込み用オブジェクトをリスト型の変数に変換する方法もあります。 import csv with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' r ' , newline = '' ) as file : reader = csv . reader ( file ) rows = list ( reader ) for row in rows : print ( row ) このコードでは、全てのテキスト情報をリスト型の変数で保持することになります。\n\nこの場合、ファイルサイズが大きければ、それに応じてリスト型の変数に大きな情報を格納することになります。\n\nもし、非常に大きなファイルをリスト型の変数に格納した場合、python やその実行環境が使用できるメモリが不足して問題となる可能性があります。 とはいえ、リスト型の変数で保持することが必ずしも問題というわけではありません。\n\nリスト型しか受け付けない関数を使用する場合や、リスト内包表記を使用する場合など、リストへの変換を行うこともあります。\n\n想定しているファイルサイズや処理内容に応じて、最適な実装方法を選択するのが理想です。 また、読み込み用オブジェクトは open 関数で取得したオブジェクト file に依存しているため、 with 句内でしかファイル読み込みを行えません。\n\n例えば、次のように with 句の外でリスト型に変換しようとした場合、ファイル読み込みに失敗するため注意が必要です。 import csv with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' r ' , newline = '' ) as file : reader = csv . reader ( file ) rows = list ( reader ) # ここでエラーが発生する for row in rows : print ( row )\n\n問題 84 csvの辞書型書き込み\n\n標準ライブラリの csv モジュールをインポートしてください。\n\n次の変数 lst の情報をカレントディレクトリのテキストファイル \"test.csv\" にヘッダ行を持つcsv形式で書き込んでください。\n\nlst = [ { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' admin ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0002 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0003 ' , ' name ' : ' test ' }, ]\n\n回答例 import csv lst = [ { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' admin ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0002 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0003 ' , ' name ' : ' test ' }, ] with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' w ' , newline = '' ) as file : writer = csv . DictWriter ( file , fieldnames = ( ' id ' , ' name ' )) writer . writeheader () writer . writerows ( lst )\n\n解説 csv モジュールを使用してファイル書き込みを行う場合、 open 関数で取得したファイルオブジェクトを指定して書き込み用オブジェクトを作成します。\n\ncsv モジュールの DictWriter 関数は、辞書型データをファイルオブジェクトへ書き込むためのオブジェクトを作成します。 csv モジュールの DictWriter 関数は、多くの点で writer 関数と共通しています。\n\nただし、 DictWriter 関数では書き込む項目の順序を定める情報として、辞書型データのキーを引数 fieldnames で指定する必要があります。 import csv with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' w ' , newline = '' ) as file : writer_1 = csv . writer ( file ) # リスト型データを書き込むオブジェクトを作成 writer_2 = csv . DictWriter ( file , fieldnames = ( ' id ' , ' name ' )) # 辞書型データを書き込むオブジェクトを作成 一方で、 writer 関数で取得した書き込み用オブジェクトに定義されたメソッド writerow や writerows は DictWriter 関数で作成した書き込み用オブジェクトでも定義されています。\n\n例えば、 writerows メソッドを使用する場合、次のようなコードは正常に動作します。 import csv lst = [ { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' admin ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0002 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0003 ' , ' name ' : ' test ' }, ] with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' w ' , newline = '' ) as file : writer = csv . DictWriter ( file , fieldnames = ( ' id ' , ' name ' )) writer . writerows ( lst ) writerow メソッドを使用する場合、次のコードも同様に動作します。 import csv lst = [ { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' admin ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0002 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0003 ' , ' name ' : ' test ' }, ] with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' w ' , newline = '' ) as file : writer = csv . DictWriter ( file , fieldnames = ( ' id ' , ' name ' )) for dct in lst : writer . writerow ( dct ) リスト型の書き込みで使用したメソッド writerow や writerows と比較すると、指定するデータがリスト型か辞書型かの違いとなっています。 最後に、この問題では「ヘッダ行を持つcsv形式で」という条件が付いています。\n\nDictWriter 関数で作成した書き込み用オブジェクトには、ヘッダを書き込むためのメソッドが定義されています。 import csv with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' w ' , newline = '' ) as file : writer = csv . DictWriter ( file , fieldnames = ( ' id ' , ' name ' )) writer . writeheader () このコードでは、引数 fieldnames で指定されていた、\"id\" と \"name\" という列情報が、 writeheader メソッドによりヘッダ情報として書き込まれます。\n\n以上を踏まえ、ヘッダ行と辞書リストを書き込む処理を実装すると回答例のようになります。\n\n問題 85 csvの辞書型読み込み\n\n標準ライブラリの csv モジュールをインポートしてください。\n\nカレントディレクトリのcsv形式のテキストファイル \"test.csv\" を読み込み、ヘッダ行をキーとする辞書を1行ずつ出力してください。\n\n回答例 import csv with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' r ' , newline = '' ) as file : reader = csv . DictReader ( file ) for dct in reader : print ( dct )\n\n解説 csv モジュールを使用してファイル読み込みを行う場合、 open 関数で取得したファイルオブジェクトを指定して読み込み用オブジェクトを作成します。\n\ncsv モジュールの DictReader 関数は、ファイルオブジェクトから辞書型でテキストを読み込むためのオブジェクトを作成します。 基本的には、 csv モジュールの DictReader 関数は、 reader 関数とほぼ同様に使用することができます。\n\nこれにより、テキストファイルの内容をリスト型と辞書型のどちらで読み込むかを使い分けることができます。 ただし、読み込んだ結果の辞書データは、ヘッダ情報をキー、行の情報を値として持つ辞書となっています。\n\nもしヘッダ行がないcsv形式のテキストファイルを読み込む場合、次のように引数 fieldnames で指定する必要があります。 import csv with open ( ' test.csv ' , ' r ' , newline = '' ) as file : reader = csv . DictReader ( file , fieldnames = [ ' id ' , ' name ' ]) for dct in reader : print ( dct )\n\n入力と出力\n\n問題 86 コマンドライン引数\n\n標準ライブラリの sys モジュールをインポートしてください。\n\nコマンドライン引数が1つだけ指定されているか判定し、次の分岐処理を行ってください。\n\n(1) コマンドライン引数が1つだけ指定されている場合、そのコマンドライン引数の値を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n(2) 指定されているコマンドライン引数が1つではない場合、メッセージ \"引数の数が不正です\" を print 関数で出力してください。\n\n回答例 import sys if len ( sys . argv ) == 2 : print ( sys . argv [ 1 ]) else : print ( \" 引数の数が不正です \" )\n\n解説 コマンドライン引数とは、プログラムを実行する際にコマンドラインから渡す文字情報のことです。\n\n例えば次のように Python スクリプトファイル \"script.py\" を実行することで、コマンドライン引数として 'test' という文字列を渡すことができます。 python script.py test このとき、スクリプトファイル \"script.py\" 側でコマンドライン引数を取得し、その値を処理に使用することが可能です。\n\nコマンドライン引数はスペース部分で区切られたリスト sys.argv に格納されます。\n\nただし、 sys.argv の先頭項目は実行ファイル名が格納されます。\n\nそのため、上記の例では sys.argv は \"script.py\" と \"test\" という2つの要素からなるリストになります。 import sys print ( sys . argv ) このリスト sys.argv からコマンドライン引数で渡された \"test\" を取得するには、通常のリスト操作で次のように記述します。 import sys print ( sys . argv [ 0 ]) # 実行ファイル名が出力される print ( sys . argv [ 1 ]) # 1つ目のコマンドライン引数が出力される このとき、 sys.argv はスペース部分で区切られたコマンドライン引数のリストです。\n\n例えばコマンドラインで次のように実行すると、 sys.argv は2つのコマンドライン引数をもつリストになります。 python script.py test_1 test_2 このように実行した場合、 sys.argv は ['script.py', 'test_1', 'test_2'] というリストになります。 また、 sys.argv は通常のリストと同じように操作することができます。\n\nこの問題ではコマンドライン引数に指定された数で条件分岐を行うように指示されていますが、コマンドライン引数の数を調べるには len 関数が使用できます。\n\nsys.argv の先頭項目は実行ファイル名が格納されることに注意すると、 len(sys.argv) でコマンドライン引数の数より 1 だけ多い数を得ることができます。 例えば、上記の2つのコマンドライン引数を指定した例で sys.argv は3つの要素からなるリストであり、 len(sys.argv) は 3 となります。\n\nこれを用いて条件分岐を行うと、回答例のコードになります。\n\n問題 87 input\n\n入力プロンプトとして \"文字を入力してください\" と表示してユーザが入力する値を取得し、入力された値を print 関数で表示してください。\n\n回答例 user_input = input ( ' 文字を入力してください ' ) print ( user_input )\n\n解説 組み込み関数 input を使用すると、ユーザの入力操作を待つ処理が開始し、入力された文字列を取得することができます。\n\nプログラムの処理はユーザが入力を完了するまで待機し、ユーザは Enter キーによって入力を完了することができます。 input 関数は、引数に指定された文字列を表示します。\n\nどのような入力を受け付けているかを表示することで、ユーザはその内容に従って入力することができます。 ユーザが入力したテキストは input 関数の戻り値として取得できます。\n\nこのとき、 input 関数の戻り値は常に文字列型です。\n\n数字が入力された場合でも文字列として扱われるため、数値として扱いたい場合は int 関数や float 関数などで型変換を行う必要があります。 回答例は input 関数でユーザの入力を待ち、その結果を表示しています。\n\n問題 88 pprint\n\n標準ライブラリの pprint モジュールから pprint 関数をインポートしてください。\n\n次の変数 lst を print 関数と pprint 関数でそれぞれ表示してください。\n\nlst = [ { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' admin ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0002 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0003 ' , ' name ' : ' test ' }, ]\n\n回答例 from pprint import pprint lst = [ { ' id ' : ' 0001 ' , ' name ' : ' admin ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0002 ' , ' name ' : ' guest ' }, { ' id ' : ' 0003 ' , ' name ' : ' test ' }, ] print ( lst ) pprint ( lst )\n\n解説 pprint モジュールの pprint 関数は、複雑なデータ構造を見やすく整形して表示します。\n\n例えば、 print 関数では2次元リストを改行せずに表示しますが、 pprint 関数を使うと要素ごとに改行されて表示されます。 この問題では、 print 関数の結果は次のようになります。 [{'id': '0001', 'name': 'admin'}, {'id': '0002', 'name': 'guest'}, {'id': '0003', 'name': 'test'}] 一方で、 pprint 関数の結果は次のようになります。 [{'id': '0001', 'name': 'admin'},\n\n{'id': '0002', 'name': 'guest'},\n\n{'id': '0003', 'name': 'test'}] この例では辞書のリストを表示していますが、2次元リストや他の複雑なデータ構造でも整形されて表示されます。\n\n問題 89 メッセージボックス\n\n標準ライブラリの tkinter モジュールのサブモジュール messagebox から showinfo 関数と askyesno 関数をインポートしてください。\n\nそれぞれの関数を使用して、\"タイトル\" と \"メッセージ\" 設定したメッセージウィンドウを表示してください。\n\n回答例 from tkinter.messagebox import showinfo , askyesno showinfo ( \" タイトル \" , \" メッセージ \" ) askyesno ( \" タイトル \" , \" メッセージ \" )\n\n解説 tkinter はウィンドウやボタンによる GUI を作成できる標準ライブラリです。\n\nこの問題では既存の関数によるメッセージウィンドウを表示しますが、独自にカスタマイズしてウィンドウを作成することも可能です。 tkinter モジュールのサブモジュール messagebox から関数をインポートする場合、 from tkinter.messagebox import 関数名 のように記述します。\n\n複数の関数をインポートする場合、カンマ区切りで複数の関数を指定することが可能です。 from tkinter.messagebox import showinfo , askyesno この問題で指定されている showinfo 関数と askyesno 関数は、それぞれ異なる機能をもつメッセージウィンドウを表示する関数です。\n\nshowinfo 関数は標準的な情報を通知するための関数で、選択できるボタンは \"OK\" のみのウィンドウを表示します。\n\n似たような関数として、異なるアイコンでエラーや警告を通知するための showerror 関数や showwarning 関数があります。 一方で、 askyesno 関数は \"Yes\" と \"No\" の2つのボタンを持つウィンドウが表示される関数です。\n\nメッセージの内容に対してユーザがどちらのボタンをクリックしたかを取得し、その結果に応じて処理を分岐することができます。\n\nただし、環境によっては \"Yes\" と \"No\" ではなく、\"はい\" と \"いいえ\" などで表示されることもあります。 次のコードは、 askyesno の戻り値を print 関数で出力して確認するものです。\n\n表示されるウィンドウで \"Yes\" をクリックした場合は True 、\"No\" をクリックした場合は False を取得できます。 from tkinter.messagebox import askyesno result = askyesno ( \" タイトル \" , \" メッセージ \" ) print ( result ) ウィンドウに表示されるタイトルとメッセージは関数の引数で指定することができます。\n\n処理の分岐をユーザに確認する際に、状況を伝えるためのタイトルやメッセージを表示することができます。\n\n次のコードはメイン処理を実行するかどうかを確認して条件分岐する例です。 from tkinter.messagebox import showinfo , askyesno def main (): showinfo ( ' メイン処理 ' , ' メイン処理が動作します ' ) result = askyesno ( \" 実行確認 \" , \" メイン処理を開始しますか？ \" ) if result : main () else : showinfo ( ' 中断通知 ' , ' 処理を中断します ' ) この問題では分岐処理についての指示がないため、回答例では関数を呼び出すだけとなっています。\n\n問題 90 ログ出力\n\n標準ライブラリの logging モジュールをインポートし、下記の basicConfig を実行してください。\n\nロガーオブジェクトを使用して、情報ログ「正常終了しました」と異常ログ「予期せぬエラーが発生しました」をログ出力してください。\n\nlogging . basicConfig ( level = logging . INFO , format = ' [%(asctime)s][%(levelname)-5s] %(message)s ' , )\n\n回答例 import logging logging . basicConfig ( level = logging . INFO , format = ' [%(asctime)s][%(levelname)-5s] %(message)s ' , ) logger = logging . getLogger ( __name__ ) logger . info ( ' 正常終了しました ' ) logger . error ( ' 予期せぬエラーが発生しました ' )\n\n解説 標準ライブラリ logging モジュールはログを管理するためのライブラリです。\n\nログ出力を行うには、 getLogger 関数を用いてログを出力するためのロガーオブジェクトを作成します。\n\nロガーオブジェクトを作成する際は、 getLogger 関数の引数にロガーの識別名を指定することができます。\n\n識別名は省略したり、目的に応じて名前を付けたりしても良いですが、マジック変数 __name__ を指定することが一般的です。 import logging logger = logging . getLogger ( __name__ ) 取得したロガーオブジェクトは、出力するログレベルに応じてメソッドを使い分けます。\n\nログレベルに対する使用可能なメソッドは次のとおりです。 レベル 数値 説明 メソッド呼び出し例 CRITICAL 50 重大なエラー。プログラムの継続が困難であることを意味します。 critical(ログメッセージ) ERROR 40 エラー。処理中に問題が発生したことを意味します。 error(ログメッセージ) , exception(ログメッセージ) WARNING 30 警告。処理は続行できるが注意が必要であることを意味します。 warning(ログメッセージ) INFO 20 情報。通常の動作に関する記録であることを意味します。 info(ログメッセージ) DEBUG 10 デバッグ情報。開発時の詳細なログ出力であることを意味します。 debug(ログメッセージ) ユーザ定義 任意の数値 独自に定義可能なログレベルです。 log(任意の数値, ログメッセージ) 表の上部の数値が大きいレベルは重大なログであり、逆に数値が小さいレベルは詳細な情報やデバッグ用のログとなります。 結果として、この問題で指定されている情報ログと異常ログは次のようにログ出力を行います。 import logging logger = logging . getLogger ( __name__ ) logger . info ( ' 正常終了しました ' ) logger . error ( ' 予期せぬエラーが発生しました ' ) 上記のコードはログ出力の処理は実行されますが、ログが出力されない可能性があります。\n\nこれは、ログがどのように出力するかを設定していないことが原因です。 ログ出力の設定はファイル出力やファイルローテーション、ログのフィルタリングなど詳細な設定が可能です。\n\n例えば、指定した INFO` レベル以上のログのみが出力されるようにフィルタリング設定することで、デバッグログを行わないように切り替えることができます。 また、詳細な設定が必要ない場合は basicConfig 関数を使うことで簡単にログの設定を行うことができます。\n\nbasicConfig 関数は最初の呼び出し時のみ設定が適用されるため、プログラムの先頭付近で一度だけ呼び出すのが一般的です。 この問題では basicConfig() 関数を使ったログ設定が指定されています。\n\n指定された設定を追加した次のコードを実行すると、コンソールにログが出力されるはずです。 import logging logging . basicConfig ( level = logging . INFO , format = ' [%(asctime)s][%(levelname)-5s] %(message)s ' , ) logger = logging . getLogger ( __name__ ) logger . info ( ' 正常終了しました ' ) logger . error ( ' 予期せぬエラーが発生しました ' ) このコードが回答例となっています。 また、上記の表ではログレベルが ERROR の際に使用するメソッドとして error と exception の2つが記載されています。\n\nerror() メソッドは単にエラーメッセージを記録するのに対し、 exception() メソッドは例外処理の中で呼び出すことでエラーに関する情報も自動でログに含めます。\n\nつまり、エラー時にログメッセージだけをログ出力する処理は error メソッドを使用し、詳細なエラー情報をログ出力処理には exception メソッドを使用します。 例えば、次のコードは0除算エラーが発生した際のエラーハンドリングを用いて、 error メソッドと exception メソッドの動作を確認しています。 import logging logging . basicConfig ( level = logging . INFO , format = ' [%(asctime)s][%(levelname)-5s] %(message)s ' , ) logging . info ( \" メソッドの動作確認開始 \" ) try : logging . info ( \" error メソッドの動作確認 \" ) result = 1 / 0 except ZeroDivisionError : logging . error ( \" error メソッドによるログ出力 \" ) # このログ出力では指定したエラーメッセージのみ出力される try : logging . info ( \" exception メソッドの動作確認 \" ) result = 1 / 0 except ZeroDivisionError : logging . exception ( \" exception メソッドによるログ出力 \" ) # このログ出力では詳細なエラー情報が出力される logging . info ( \" メソッドの動作確認終了 \" )\n\n問題 91 九九の計算とファイル操作\n\n計算結果のいずれかの桁が3である九九の計算式をカレントディレクトリのテキストファイル \"output.txt\" に書き出してください。\n\n作成する計算式は次のような書式とします。\n\n1 × 3 = 3\n\n3 × 1 = 3\n\n4 × 8 = 32\n\n4 × 9 = 36\n\n...\n\n9 × 4 = 36\n\n9 × 7 = 63\n\n回答例 filepath = ' output.txt ' calc_list = [ f ' { i } × { j } = { i * j } ' for i in range ( 1 , 10 ) for j in range ( 1 , 10 ) if ' 3 ' in str ( i * j ) ] calc_text = '\n\n' . join ( calc_list ) with open ( filepath , ' w ' ) as file : file . write ( calc_text )\n\n解説 回答例では、改行を含むリスト内包表記を使用し、2重ループを実現しています。\n\nリスト内包表記を使用せず、次のようなコードでも同じ結果を得ることができます。 filepath = ' output.txt ' with open ( filepath , ' w ' ) as file : for i in range ( 1 , 10 ): for j in range ( 1 , 10 ): if ' 3 ' in str ( i * j ): file . write ( f ' { i } × { j } = { i * j }\n\n' ) このコードは、 with 、 for 、 for 、 if とインデントが深くなってしまっています。\n\nインデントが深くなりすぎてしまうとコードが見づらくなることがあるため、必要以上に深くならないように気を付けることをお勧めします。\n\n同じ結果を得るにも様々なコードが検討できるため、様々な選択肢を検討し適切なコードを選ぶことが理想です。\n\n問題 92 ループと条件分岐の関数\n\n引数で指定された範囲の正の整数の内、いずれかの桁が 3 である整数の集合を返す関数 find_numbers を作成してください。\n\nただし、関数 find_numbers は2つの引数 start と end を持ち、 start 以上 end 未満の正の整数を対象範囲として扱ってください。\n\n回答例 def find_numbers ( start , end ): if start < 1 : target_range = range ( 1 , end ) else : target_range = range ( start , end ) return { num for num in target_range if ' 3 ' in str ( num )}\n\n解説 問題文では引数で指定された範囲は、「 start 以上 end 未満の正の整数を対象」となっています。\n\nあまり強調されていませんが、 0 以下の数が引数に指定された場合は正の整数のみが対象となるように調整する必要があります。 また、関数に整数ではなく少数（浮動小数点型）が指定された場合や、数値以外が指定された場合の挙動については詳しく指定されていません。\n\nここは練習問題なので細かく気にする必要はありませんが、実務では慎重に検討することをお勧めします。\n\n問題 93 ループの終了条件\n\nコマンドラインに \"1桁の整数を入力してください\" と表示し、ユーザの入力を取得してください。\n\nユーザが入力した値を x として、いずれかの桁が x に一致する正の整数を小さいほうから10個表示してください。\n\nただし、入力された値が1桁の整数でない場合は、ユーザに入力を求める処理に戻って処理を継続してください。\n\n回答例 COUNT_MAX = 10 NUMBER_SET = { str ( i ) for i in range ( 10 )} user_input = None while user_input not in NUMBER_SET : user_input = input ( ' 1桁の整数を入力してください\n\n' ) num = 1 count = 0 while count < COUNT_MAX : if user_input in str ( num ): print ( num ) count += 1 num += 1\n\n解説 この問題では「小さいほうから10個表示」と指定されています。\n\nしかし、この10個という数字は本質的には重要ではなく、11個でも12個でも100個でも、必要に応じて変更できる数字です。\n\n状況によっては、次のように変更しやすくする仕様も考えられます。 ユーザが入力する コマンドライン引数で指定する 設定ファイルから取得する 今回は「小さいほうから10個表示」という条件に従い、回答例では処理の先頭で COUNT_MAX という変数を使用して設定しています。\n\nこのような変数の使い方は \"定数\" と呼ばれ、ファイル入出力のためのファイルパスなどにも使用されます。 さらに、ユーザが入力する値は「1桁の整数」を想定しており、回答例では「1桁の整数」を定数 NUMBER_SET で管理しています。\n\n例えば、ユーザが 'exit' と入力した場合は処理を終了する、という仕様も考えられます。\n\n何でも定数にすれば良いというわけではないですが、必要に応じて工夫できると良いでしょう。 また、この問題では入力された値が1桁の整数でない場合、単純にユーザの入力処理に戻る仕様となっています。\n\nもしかすると、入力された値が条件を満たしていないことをユーザに通知した方が親切な仕様かもしれません。 NUMBER_SET = { str ( i ) for i in range ( 10 )} while True : user_input = input ( ' 1桁の整数を入力してください\n\n' ) if user_input in NUMBER_SET : print ( f ' 1桁の整数 { user_input } が入力されました。 ' ) break else : print ( f ' 1桁の整数を入力してください。入力された値は { user_input } です。 ' ) user_input = input ( ' 1桁の整数を入力してください\n\n' ) 実務で勝手に仕様を変更すると危険ですが、仕様の考慮漏れや記載漏れの可能性もあります。\n\n改善の提案が喜ばれることもあれば、仕様どおりに対応する必要があることもあるでしょう。\n\n立場や環境に応じて、ぜひ柔軟に対応してください。\n\n問題 94 複雑なデータ構造\n\n次の3次元構造を持つ変数 data から、タプル内の集合の要素数が 1 であるタプルデータを出力してください。\n\ndata = [ ( ' 001 ' , ' 001 ' , { 1 , 4 }), ( ' 001 ' , ' 002 ' , { 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 }), ( ' 001 ' , ' 003 ' , { 2 , 3 }), ( ' 001 ' , ' 004 ' , { 5 }), ( ' 001 ' , ' 005 ' , { 6 , 7 , 8 }), ( ' 002 ' , ' 001 ' , { 3 , 7 }), ( ' 002 ' , ' 002 ' , { 9 }), ( ' 002 ' , ' 003 ' , { 3 , 8 }), ( ' 002 ' , ' 004 ' , { 2 }), ( ' 002 ' , ' 005 ' , { 3 , 5 }), ]\n\n回答例 data = [ ( ' 001 ' , ' 001 ' , { 1 , 4 }), ( ' 001 ' , ' 002 ' , { 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 }), ( ' 001 ' , ' 003 ' , { 2 , 3 }), ( ' 001 ' , ' 004 ' , { 5 }), ( ' 001 ' , ' 005 ' , { 6 , 7 , 8 }), ( ' 002 ' , ' 001 ' , { 3 , 7 }), ( ' 002 ' , ' 002 ' , { 9 }), ( ' 002 ' , ' 003 ' , { 3 , 8 }), ( ' 002 ' , ' 004 ' , { 2 }), ( ' 002 ' , ' 005 ' , { 3 , 5 }), ] filtered_data = [ d for d in data if len ( d [ 2 ]) == 1 ] for row in filtered_data : print ( row )\n\n解説 この問題では、リストの中にタプル、タプルの中に集合という3次元のデータ構造を持つ変数を扱っています。\n\n複雑なデータ構造は様々な場面で登場します。\n\n次の例はその一部です。 設定ファイルの階層構造\n\nWebAPI における JSON 形式のデータ構造\n\nWebスクレイピングにおける HTML 形式のデータ構造\n\n画像データの位置と色を表すデータ構造\n\n問題 95 文字列の抽出\n\n下記の変数 target_text に含まれる単語のうち、 4 文字以内の単語を print 関数で表示してください。\n\nただし、単語は文章中のスペースで区切られた文字列を指し、言語上の文法は考えないものとします。\n\ntarget_text = ' Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively '\n\n回答例 target_text = ' Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively ' target_words = target_text . split () result = [ word for word in target_words if len ( word ) <= 4 ] for word in result : print ( word )\n\n解説 今回の問題では「言語上の文法は考えない」という条件が指定されているため、 split 関数を用いて単純なスペース区切りで処理できます。\n\nただし、より現実的な文章は複雑であり、実務では次のような観点を考慮する必要が出てくることもあります。 単語の抽出方法\n\n実際の文章には \".\"、\"、\"、\"?\"、\"!\" といった記号が含まれます。\n\nこれだけでも、スペースで分割するだけでは単語を抽出できないことが分かります。\n\nさらに、日本語の場合は単語がスペースで分かれているわけでもありません。 単語の活用形\n\n文章の中では単語は活用した形で現れます。\n\nこの問題の文章でも、\"programming\" は \"program\"、\"lets\" は \"let\" として抽出するとなると格段に難しくなります。 表記揺れの統一\n\n英語であれば大文字と小文字、日本語では平仮名と片仮名、漢字や全角半角を用いて、同じ単語を別の表記で表すことがあります。\n\nそのような表記の違いを無視し、同じものとして扱う必要に迫られるかもしれません。\n\n問題 96 辞書の操作関数\n\n引数で与えられた辞書のキーと値を逆にした辞書を返す関数 reverse_dict を作成してください。\n\nただし、処理に失敗した場合は None を返してください。\n\n回答例 def reverse_dict ( input_dict ): try : output_dict = { v : k for k , v in input_dict . items ()} except Exception : return None if len ( input_dict ) != len ( output_dict ): return None return output_dict\n\n解説 この問題では辞書内包表記を用いて関数 reverse_dict を定義します。\n\n「処理に失敗した場合は None 」という仕様であるため、エラーハンドリングを行う必要があります。 この問題では、基本的に全てのエラーを処理するという方針になります。\n\nそのための方法の1つに、具体的なエラーを指定せず except 句を記述する方法があります。 import sys try : sys . exit () except : print ( ' 予期せぬエラーが発生しました ' ) この方法は処理可能な全ての例外に対応するため、通常は推奨されません。\n\nもしこの方法を使用する場合、次のような例外もエラーとして処理されてしまいます。 Pyhton スクリプトがプログラムを終了させる際に発生させる例外 SystemExit\n\n開発者がプログラムを終了させる際に発生させる例外 KeyboardInterrupt このように意図せずプログラムの終了を阻害する可能性があるため、具体的なエラーを指定しない方法でのエラーハンドリングは危険です。\n\n特定の例外だけを処理したい場合は、 TypeError や AttributeError などと具体的に記述するのが安全です。 それでも予期しないエラーに対応したい場合、 Exception を指定します。\n\nこの方法であれば SystemExit や KeyboardInterrupt は捕捉されず、通常のエラーのみ処理できます。 try : raise ValueError ( ' 指定された値が不正です ' ) except Exception as e : print ( f ' 予期せぬエラーが発生しました\n\n{ e } ' ) この問題では、キーと値を逆にすることでキー重複が発生する可能性があります。\n\nしかし、辞書内包表記で同じキーが複数回現れた場合、最後に出現した値が適用されてエラーは発生しません。\n\nそこで回答例では、キー重複により辞書の長さが減少した場合は None とする処理を行っています。 これにより、キーと値を逆にすることに成功した場合のみ辞書を返す関数を実現できます。 def reverse_dict ( input_dict ): try : output_dict = { v : k for k , v in input_dict . items ()} except Exception : return None if len ( input_dict ) != len ( output_dict ): return None return output_dict print ( reverse_dict ({ ' a ' : 1 , ' b ' : 2 , ' c ' : 3 })) # キーと値を逆にした辞書を返す print ( reverse_dict ({ ' a ' : 1 , ' b ' : 2 , ' c ' : { 3 }})) # 集合をキーに設定できないため None を返す print ( reverse_dict ({ ' a ' : 1 , ' b ' : 2 , ' c ' : 1 })) # 1 がキー重複するため None を返す print ( reverse_dict ( ' not a dict ' )) # 辞書型でないため None を返す\n\n問題 97 辞書を使った文字列のカウント\n\nテキストファイルを読み込み、その中に現れる各文字の出現回数を全て表示してください。\n\n回答例 file_path = ' output.txt ' with open ( file_path , ' r ' ) as file : text = file . read () count_dict = {} for char in text : if char in count_dict : count_dict [ char ] += 1 else : count_dict [ char ] = 1 for key , value in count_dict . items (): print ( f ' { key } : { value } 回 ' )\n\n解説 回答例は、テキストファイルを読み込み、各文字の出現回数を辞書オブジェクトを使って保持しています。\n\n問題文の条件は満たしていますが、出現する文字が多い場合は出力行数が多く、出現回数を把握しづらいと言えます。\n\n例えば、一番多い文字は何回出現しているのか、どの文字の出現回数が多いのか、といった情報がすぐに分かりません。 出現回数が一番多いものは組み込み関数 max を使うことで調べることができます。 file_path = ' output.txt ' with open ( file_path , ' r ' ) as file : text = file . read () count_dict = {} for char in text : if char in count_dict : count_dict [ char ] += 1 else : count_dict [ char ] = 1 # 出現回数の最大値を取得 max_count = max ( v for v in count_dict . values ()) # 出現回数最大の文字・出現回数を抽出 max_dict = { k : v for k , v in count_dict . items () if v == max_count } print ( max_dict ) 出現回数が多い文字は、組み込み関数 sorted で出現回数順に並び変えることで調べることができます。 file_path = ' output.txt ' with open ( file_path , ' r ' ) as file : text = file . read () count_dict = {} for char in text : if char in count_dict : count_dict [ char ] += 1 else : count_dict [ char ] = 1 # ソートしたリストを取得 sorted_dict = sorted ( count_dict . items (), key = lambda item : item [ 1 ]) # ソートされたリストを出力 from pprint import pprint pprint ( sorted_dict ) ただし、このコードでは並び替えの条件として lambda item: item[1] を指定しています。\n\nlambda は関数を作成するための機能です。 このように、この100問の練習問題では紹介できていない Python の便利な機能が多数存在します。\n\nとはいえ、それらを全て覚える必要があるわけではありません。\n\nその多くの機能は、基本的な知識で使いこなせるものばかりです。\n\nまずはクラスやオブジェクト、関数やメソッドといった基本的なプログラミングの知識を身に着けることが上達の近道です。\n\n問題 98 特定条件の文字列結合クラス\n\n変数 target_list にリスト [1, 2, 3, None, 5, None, 7] を代入してください。\n\n次の条件を満たすクラスを作成し、変数 target_list の None でない要素を文字列 \"&\" で結合した文字列 \"1&2&3&5&7\" を出力してください。\n\nクラス名：\n\nStringJoiner\n\n概要：\n\n追加されたデータを文字列として保持し、指定された区切り文字でそれらを結合する機能を提供します。\n\nインスタンス変数：\n\nitems : 追加されたデータを文字列として保持するためのリストデータです。\n\nメソッド：\n\n__init__(self) : インスタンス変数 items を空のリストに初期化します。 append(self, item) : 引数 item が None でない場合、文字列に変換してインスタンス変数 items に追加します。 join(self, delimiter) : 引数で指定された文字列 delimiter でインスタンス変数 items を結合した文字列を返します。\n\n引数 delimiter は省略可能で、デフォルト値は空文字列です。\n\n回答例 class StringJoiner : def __init__ ( self ): self . items = [] def append ( self , item ): if item is not None : self . items . append ( str ( item )) def join ( self , delimiter = '' ): return delimiter . join ( self . items ) target_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , None , 5 , None , 7 ] sj = StringJoiner () for item in target_list : sj . append ( item ) result = sj . join ( ' & ' ) print ( result )\n\n解説 この問題で期待する出力文字列 \"1&2&3&5&7\" は、クラスを使用なくても次のようなコードで取得することが可能です。 target_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , None , 5 , None , 7 ] filtered_list = [ str ( item ) for item in target_list if item is not None ] result = ' & ' . join ( filtered_list ) print ( result ) しかし、より複雑な抽出条件や結合条件がある場合には、クラスを用いることで分かりやすいコードになることがあります。\n\n問題 99 リストの補正と補正情報\n\n変数 lst にリスト [1, 2 , 3, None, 5, None, 7] を代入してください。\n\n変数 lst の要素の値が偶数でない場合は 2 倍したリスト converted_list を作成してください。\n\nただし、偶数であるかどうかは 2 で割った余りが 0 かどうかで判定し、判定に失敗した要素は 0 に変換してください。\n\nこのとき、変換を行った情報を次のようなリストで保持し、 pprint 関数で出力してください。\n\n[\n\n{'index': 0, 'from': 1, 'to': 2},\n\n{'index': 2, 'from': 3, 'to': 6},\n\n{'index': 3, 'from': None, 'to': 0},\n\n{'index': 4, 'from': 5, 'to': 10},\n\n{'index': 5, 'from': None, 'to': 0},\n\n{'index': 6, 'from': 7, 'to': 14},\n\n]\n\n回答例 from pprint import pprint lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , None , 5 , None , 7 ] converted_list = [] conversion_info = [] for i in range ( len ( lst )): item = lst [ i ] conversion_dict = None try : if item % 2 != 0 : conversion_dict = { ' index ' : i , ' from ' : item , ' to ' : item * 2 } except Exception : conversion_dict = { ' index ' : i , ' from ' : item , ' to ' : 0 } if conversion_dict is None : converted_list . append ( item ) else : converted_list . append ( conv"}

Jon Ossoff said on Friday that President Donald Trump has committed several offenses that warrant him being impeached.\n\nA woman at a town hall demanded that Democrats, including Ossoff, impeach and remove Trump from office. The senator said he agreed with the woman, stating that Trump’s conduct has “exceeded any prior standard for impeachment.”\n\n“There is no doubt that this president’s conduct has already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment by the United States House of Representatives,” Ossoff said. “I saw just 48 hours ago, he is granting audiences to people who buy his meme coin. So it is in our corrupt political system, it is a standard practice, tragically, for elected officials to grant audiences and time to people in exchange for campaign contributions. He is granting audience to people who purchase the meme coin that directly enriches him. So, where is everybody who was so furious about Hunter Biden’s paintings, which by the way, I do not defend … There is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense.” (RELATED: Al Green Says Democrats Could Impeach Trump ‘More Than Once’)\n\nWATCH:\n\nOssoff further accused Trump of defying a federal court order put in place by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who ordered that a plane transporting over 200 members of Tren de Agua be returned to the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act. The White House has repeatedly asserted that they did not defy the order since the planes were already outside of U.S. territory by the time the judge made the ruling.\n\nThe senator said that he is working everyday to win a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives so his party can impeach Trump again.\n\nOssoff is up for reelection in Georgia’s Senate race during the 2026 midterms, which Republicans see as one of their best opportunities to expand their majority in the chamber. Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is currently seen as a possible contender to run against Ossoff in the midterm race, which could threaten Ossoff’s chances of reelection given his popularity in the state.\n\nDemocrat Texas Rep. Al Green filed three articles of impeachment against Trump, and recently told protesters in early April that he will bring articles of impeachment against the president in the next 30 days. He has repeatedly said that Trump does not deserve to continue holding office, even though he became the first Republican president in 20 years to win the popular vote.\n\nHouse Democrats, at the direction of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, filed the first articles of impeachment against Trump on Dec. 18, 2019, in connection to a phone call where Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to announce two investigations into then-former Vice President Joe Biden’s family ahead of the 2020 election. The president was impeached a second time in January 2021 in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) said that Ossoff is attempting to “overturn the will of Georgia voters” who elected Trump in November 2024. “Jon Ossoff said he’s working every single day to overturn the will of Georgia voters who just elected President Trump,” Nick Puglia, the NRSC regional press secretary, said. “It’s disgusting and Georgians deserve better than a liberal resistance darling who sides with illegal immigrants and men who want to infiltrate women’s sports.”\n\nAdam Pack contributed to this report\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The company claims that OpenAI used its content without permission to train AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Delaware, alleges that OpenAI “intentionally and relentlessly” copied and used articles from Ziff Davis brands, even though the company had taken steps to prevent such scraping. According to the complaint, OpenAI ignored robots.txt instructions on Ziff Davis websites and even removed copyright notices from the material it used.\n\nZiff Davis, which owns over 45 digital media outlets and publishes around 2 million articles each year, claims that OpenAI reproduced its work in its training datasets, which then reflected in ChatGPT’s responses. The company has asked the court to stop OpenAI from using its content and to destroy any models or data containing its copyrighted material.\n\n“OpenAI has taken each of these steps knowing that they violate Ziff Davis’s intellectual property rights and the law,” the complaint states.\n\nThe publisher also said that in a small sample of OpenAI’s WebText dataset, it found hundreds of full articles from its platforms, suggesting widespread misuse.\n\nIn response to The Verge, OpenAI spokesperson Jason Deutrom defended the company, saying, “ChatGPT helps enhance human creativity, advance scientific discovery and medical research, and enable hundreds of millions of people to improve their daily lives.” He added that “Our models empower innovation, and are trained on publicly available data and grounded in fair use.”\n\nGrowing List of Copyright Lawsuits Against OpenAI\n\nZiff Davis is one of the largest media companies to file legal action against OpenAI. Other notable entities, including The New York Times, The Intercept, and a group of Canadian publishers, have also filed lawsuits against OpenAI over similar claims. Meanwhile, some media outlets, such as The Associated Press and The Washington Post, have opted to license their content to OpenAI through paid agreements.\n\nNotable Lawsuits:\n\nMedia Companies That Signed Licensing Agreements with OpenAI\n\nMeanwhile, several media organisations have opted for licensing agreements with OpenAI, allowing the AI company to legally use their content in exchange for compensation. These partnerships include:\n\nThe Washington Post (USA):\n\nIn April 2025, The Washington Post signed a licensing agreement with OpenAI, allowing ChatGPT to provide summaries, quotes, and direct links to the newspaper’s articles. This agreement covers topics such as politics, global affairs, and business, with proper attribution.\n\nTime Inc. (USA):\n\nIn June 2024, Time Inc. entered into a licensing deal granting OpenAI access to its archives, enabling the company to use Time’s content for AI model training and generating responses in products like ChatGPT.\n\nNews Corp (USA):\n\nIn May 2024, News Corp, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal and other major publications, signed a licensing agreement with OpenAI. This deal allows OpenAI to use articles from The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and others for AI model development.\n\nAxios (USA):\n\nIn January 2025, OpenAI partnered with Axios to fund four new local newsrooms as part of a content licensing agreement. This collaboration aims to expand local news coverage.\n\nVox Media (USA):\n\nThe parent company of outlets like The Verge and Vox, Vox Media entered into a licensing agreement with OpenAI, allowing it to use content from its various brands to train AI models.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThe Atlantic (USA):\n\nThe Atlantic signed a licensing deal with OpenAI in 2024, allowing the company to use its articles for training purposes and content generation, ensuring compensation for its intellectual property.\n\nThe Associated Press (USA):\n\nThe AP has entered into a deal to license its news articles to OpenAI, marking a significant move by a major news organisation to capitalise on the growing AI industry.\n\nThese agreements illustrate how media companies are navigating the evolving AI landscape by monetising their intellectual property and ensuring compensation for the use of their content.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe Ziff Davis lawsuit is part of a broader legal reckoning that could reshape how AI companies access and use copyrighted material. As AI models become more advanced, they rely heavily on vast datasets, often scraped from the open internet, to learn and generate responses. Media companies, authors, and artists argue that this practice exploits their work without consent or compensation, threatening both their revenue models and creative control.\n\nThis issue is especially urgent given the mixed outcomes emerging from courts. For instance, recently, AI company Anthropic secured a significant legal win in the U.S. after a federal judge denied a request from music publishers to block it from using copyrighted song lyrics to train its chatbot, Claude. The court emphasised that stopping AI training at this early stage could stifle innovation, setting an important — and controversial — precedent.\n\nThe contrast between cases like Anthropic’s and the growing number of lawsuits against OpenAI — from The New York Times to authors like George R.R. Martin — highlights the legal uncertainty surrounding AI training practices. Depending on how courts rule, companies may either be required to license all third-party content or be permitted to continue under the doctrine of fair use.

Millions of customers of Marks and Spencer, one of the country’s largest and oldest high street retailers, have had to endure a week of operational mayhem after the retailer suffered what it calls a “cyber incident.”\n\nThe problems began during the Easter weekend when M&S customers started reporting issues with contactless payments and online order delays. On Tuesday, the company confirmed that it was dealing with a “cyber incident.” Then, on Wednesday, it told the media that its customer-facing operations were back to normal. But that didn’t last long. A day later, it had little choice but to take some operations offline as part of its “proactive management of the incident.”\n\nM&S has also paused click and collect orders and contactless payments. Staff at the company’s London HQ were also told to stop using the building’s wifi.\n\nWhile M&S has notified data protection supervisory authorities and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), it has not disclosed any concrete details about the nature of the cyber incident or whether customer data has been compromised. Meanwhile, no ransomware gangs or other threat actors have claimed responsibility for the attack, possibly because “the attackers are attempting to pressure M&S into paying an extortion demand,” said cybersecurity firm Cytex.\n\nIf ransomware is indeed behind the attack, that data will probably have been ransacked and is being used as additional leverage to compel payment. And when it comes to customer data, M&S has vast deposits of the stuff. The company has over 5 million store card holders while its Sparks loyalty scheme has over 16 million members globally, including millions of customers in India where it has roughly 100 stores.\n\nThe company’s stores have remained open throughout the week. However, it has stopped taking orders entirely through its website and app, which account for more than a third of its clothing and homeware sales, and contactless payments are still apparently unavailable in stores. As the BBC reported on Thursday, the chaos and uncertainty show no sign of letting up as the fallout from the “cyber incident” continues to hamper operations:\n\nContactless payments have since been restored, the BBC has been told, however this has been questioned by some customers. BBC staff have described witnessing the impact of the suspension of contactless payments. At Euston station, in London, shop staff were seen shouting that it was cash only as the payments system was down. Disruption was also seen in Glasgow, and a store at Edinburgh Haymarket seemingly closed early. M&S says it had made the “decision to move some of our processes offline to protect our colleagues, partners, suppliers and our business”. But stores remain open and customers could “continue to shop on our website and our app”, the statement added. But confusion has reigned on social media amongst M&S customers. The firm has responded to some posts on X (formerly Twitter) in the past few hours advising customers contactless payments can be taken in stores However, this has been contradicted by some individuals, with one saying: “That is wrong – only chip and pin or cash is working”.\n\nIn other words, shoppers who exclusively use mobile payment apps for their purchases will have walked away empty-handed. According to UK Finance, a British trade association for the UK banking and financial services sector, as many as one-third of UK adults now use mobile contactless payments.\n\nWhen it comes to embracing contactless payments in general, the UK is ahead of most of its peers, including the US, which explains why payment outages in the UK tend to take such a toll. Whereas contactless payments are becoming increasingly common in the US, they are more or less ubiquitous in the UK.\n\nContactless transactions in the UK surged from 6.6 billion in 2018 to 18.3 billion in 2023, according to a study by the credit card processor Clearly Payments. To put that in perspective, the US, a country with a population five times larger than the UK’s, registered a slightly lower volume of contactless transactions. The UK’s adoption rate for contactless payments, at 93.4%, is only bettered by Singapore (97%) and Australia (95%), according to Forbes.\n\nPart of a Broader Trend\n\nThis is not the first time that IT system outages have caused problems on the British high street and retail parks. When Visa’s payment system for Western Europe suffered a 12-hour outage in 2018, the chaos it caused in the UK was particularly acute due to the fact that a staggering £1 in every £3 of all retail spending passed through Visa’s systems accounts — and that was seven years ago!\n\nIn May 2024, the supermarket giant Sainsbury’s suffered a massive outage that disabled contactless and mobile payments across all of its stores for an entire Saturday. Sainsbury’s blamed the outage on a software glitch that impacted its online ordering system and contactless in-store payments.\n\nTo compound matters, hours after Sainsbury’s system went down, Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket chain, with some 4,000 stores, announced that it, too, was having to cancel online orders due to a “technical issue.” As we reported at the time, “in a country where the overwhelming majority of people have abandoned cash in favour of the speed and convenience of contactless payments and where banks have been closing branches and ATMs at breakneck speed, making it harder for their customers to access cash, the result was chaos.”\n\nA couple of months later, when the Crowdstrike IT software glitch brought down global IT networks, the UK was once again disproportionately impacted. Four of the country’s largest newspapers — The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, The Times and The Daily Mail — even ran articles on how the global IT outage had underscored the fragility of a cashless society. The Daily Mail plastered the message across its front page:\n\nWarnings from Scandinavia\n\nOne of the most important arguments in favour of cash, which we keep banging on about, is the resilience it provides to a country’s overarching payments system. Put another way, cash does not crash. It does not fail in a power cut or seize up during a cyber attack or software outage (though, of course, ATMs might). By contrast, digital payment systems generally need a stable and continuous internet connection and power supply to process transactions. They are also vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n\nThis is a lesson central bankers in Sweden, one of the world’s most cashless economies, are frantically relearning. From our post, “The World’s Oldest Central Bank Keeps Sounding Alarm on Fragility of Cashless Economies. Are Other Central Banks Listening?”\n\nAfter playing a part in the wholesale removal of cash from Sweden’s economy, the Riksbank is now trying to reverse some of the damage it has caused. It is not the only Scandinavian central bank to have flagged up the fragility risks of exclusively digital payment systems. In 2022, the Bank of Finland recommended that the use of cash payments be guaranteed by law. Like all Nordic countries, Finland is a largely cash-free economy. But like Sweden, it has begun to see the risks of going too far, too soon.\n\nSince then, Norway has also brought in legislation that means retailers can be fined or sanctioned if they refuse to accept cash. The government has also urged citizens to “keep some cash on hand due to the vulnerabilities of digital payment solutions to cyber-attacks”. As The Guardian put it, “Nordic countries were early adopters of digital payments. Now, electronic banking is seen as a potential threat to national security.”\n\nThe same, unfortunately, cannot be said of the UK, where successive governments refuse to take any action to protect the use of cash in retail settings. It is also becoming more and more difficult to use cash to pay for basic services, including car parks, train buffets and leisure centres.\n\n“The vast majority of the public want cash to be honoured as a payment,” said Ron Delnevo, chair of the Payment Choice Alliance, which campaigns for the long-term future of cash services. Delnovo pointed to a survey conducted by YouGov in June 2023 on behalf of the alliance revealed that 71% of British adults would support a legal requirement for businesses to accept cash.\n\nAn early day motion tabled in parliament in February called for the government to implement legislation to require all businesses in the UK to accept cash, but ministers have steadfastly refused.\n\nThis makes it all the more impressive that cash use has rebounded for the past two years despite the concerted efforts by the government, banks and retailers to limit its use. With a little luck, the past week’s mayhem at Marks & Spencer will help to accentuate this trend. One also hopes that companies are taking stock of these events and realising that their business continuity plans must contain analogue backups that allow transactions to continue with cash instore."}

To be clear, I’m a Texan who’s been raging at gigantic 20-foot-long F-150 pavement princesses for more than a decade now—and yet, my desktop PC-building heart is going thump-thump-thump for the Slate electric pickup truck.\n\nSlate is an American electric vehicle (EV) startup, and it’s far from the only one. We’ve seen almost every company that tried to follow in the footsteps of Tesla stumble and fall, dealing with the realities of a hugely competitive market that’s very difficult to break into. But Slate has the eye of the car-buying press because it’s shooting for a small, low-cost pickup truck, something that American buyers have been desperately missing for a long time. It probably doesn’t hurt that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is a high-profile investor—that’ll get you some headlines.\n\nThe Slate pickup, with a name the same as the company, is aiming low. And I mean really low. The base model is expected to debut at $27,500 or so when it hits the streets in 2026, which would make it $20,000 if the US federal EV tax credit holds. (That seems like a long shot at this point.) But even without the credit, it would be cheaper than the Ford Maverick, the least expensive pickup truck on the US market right now. (Miss me with the “it’s not a truck” arguments. Again, the site is called PCWorld.) And it would be the cheapest electric pickup by far, with the F-150 Lightning starting at around $50,000.\n\nHow does Slate plan to do this? Well, again, it’s a very small pickup truck. By length it’s shorter than the Maverick, only a little longer than the 2-door Jeep Wrangler. This is the kind of teeny pickup Americans haven’t seen since the 80s, and enthusiasts have even taken to importing teeny-tiny “Kei trucks” to get their fix when all they can buy at dealers are giant gas guzzlers. Slate is well aware of this hole in the market and leaning into it, combining it with electric guts for maximum appeal to small truck fans, tech nerds, and those who just want something affordable.\n\nBut Slate is more than just a name. It’s a philosophy. See, the Slate is kind of like the truck version of an ATX desktop or a Framework laptop. When you buy the base model, it is indeed a base model. It has manual, wind-up, wind-down windows. It has no interior entertainment system and no speakers. It only has a tiny LCD screen for the speedometer and instrument cluster. It does have a phone holder, because it expects you to navigate and get your tunes from the phone in your pocket. This thing doesn’t even have paint—it only comes in slate gray (ha) and will wrap its big, flat external panels if you want something else.\n\nThe Slate’s interior comes with a phone charger and not much else, not even power windows. You can add in all the electronics yourself, from Slate or your own gear. Slate\n\nThere’s the rub. Slate is both rejecting the car trend of upselling you tons and tons of extras, and embracing customization options at the same time. You can configure the Slate in near-endless ways. You can add a rear roof and an extra row of seats to make it an SUV. You can order a lift kit to make it more capable off-road (though sadly there’s no AWD or 4×4 option at launch). You can add extra range with a bigger battery. You can add in all the extra little creature comforts in the exterior that’ll bring it up to modern standards, including speakers and power windows.\n\nAnd here’s the crucial thing that gets me excited: you can add all of these elements to the truck yourself. Slate will sell the parts directly to you and give you videos on how to install them. While this was generally an option for modern cars, it’s far from easy, and plenty of installations require some advanced knowledge or tools. Slate plans to make it easy for anyone with a basic home tool box and access to YouTube, and it’s calling the instructional videos “Slate University.”\n\nSlate\n\nWhile Slate will be happy to sell you all these customizations pre-installed, you can also buy them and install them yourself at any time, even swapping them out to reconfigure the truck for specific purposes. Suddenly got a new family member and need an extra row of seats? Just order the SUV kit and break out the ratchet set. And since it’s all designed to be as accessible as possible, even for non-greasemonkeys, I imagine that the aftermarket parts makers (especially those that are already selling gear for pickup trucks and Jeeps) are going to have a feeding frenzy.\n\nAgain, the variability and invitation to tinker remind me of the wide-open possibilities when building a desktop PC. And this “customize it however you want” approach is pretty much exactly what Framework is doing with its excellent laptops, right down to the modular USB-C ports that can be swapped almost instantly. Granted, shifting a bog-standard Slate pickup to a full SUV would take a lot more time and effort. But it wouldn’t take a trip to the dealership, and that’s the appeal for me.\n\nSlate\n\nSlate is currently taking reservations for its initial deliveries, planned for late 2026. A refundable $50 deposit saves your spot, and in the meantime you can use Slate’s very fun customization tool to tweak your little dream electric truck to your heart’s desire.\n\nThere’s a lot that can happen in the next year and change—just ask anyone who’s trying to run a US-based PC business right now. I wouldn’t bet more than fifty bucks on Slate making that timeline in the current chaos, or keeping to that low starting price. But for the first time in a long time, a new car has me genuinely excited. Just get me that AWD option before too long, please, because a rear-wheel drive pickup is not going to get up a gravel driveway in five inches of snow."}

With a new-look forward line likely and the future of Trent Alexander-Arnold still unresolved, there are growing indications that a structural shift could be on the horizon—potentially towards a 4-4-2. The club’s reported interest in Bayer Leverkusen’s dynamic wing-back Jeremie Frimpong, combined with the contract stand-off involving Alexander-Arnold, suggests a more traditional shape could accommodate tactical efficiency and incoming personnel.\n\nIf Trent does depart, and with Mohamed Salah expected to remain for at least two more years, a partnership-based front line may be the solution that maximises Liverpool’s elite assets without overcomplicating their defensive responsibilities.\n\nTrent’s Uncertain Future and Frimpong’s Attacking Profile\n\nAlexander-Arnold’s contract situation remains in a state of limbo. While the club maintains a dialogue with his camp and the player himself, Real Madrid’s interest is real and unresolved, one that is bro by the player out to the extreme by prominent social media accounts. Should he move on, it would leave not just a tactical gap but an ideological one—Liverpool would lose a creative conduit that was defined under Jürgen Klopp. But Slot, with a more structured and less possession-obsessed approach, may favour a cleaner tactical solution: balance across all four lines of play, rather than building a system around a single fullback’s unique skill set.\n\nFrimpong’s name has surfaced regularly and fits this evolving idea. The Dutchman is not a traditional right-back but a high-flying wing-back with incredible attacking output. Slot’s prior teams in Rotterdam have leaned on width, overlapping runners, and rapid transitions—Frimpong offers all three. His inclusion would not require replicating Trent’s playmaking but could, instead, simplify the shape. That paves the way for a compact back four, a flat or narrow midfield four, and a forward duo that takes advantage of Salah’s experience in central spaces. The signing of the wide man would see him move into a traditional right win position, with the need for a new and more defensive right back still there.\n\nA New Strike Force, and Salah’s Next Evolution\n\nIt’s no secret that Liverpool are in the market for one, potentially two forwards. With Darwin Núñez’s inconsistency and Diogo Jota’s fitness struggles, Slot will want a focal point who can stretch defences but also play in tight areas. A 4-4-2—featuring Salah in a second striker role—could allow the Egyptian to transition into the next phase of his career, preserving his explosiveness while easing the physical burden of touchline-to-touchline wing play.\n\nSzoboszlai, too, could be a key beneficiary. If stationed on the left of a midfield four, he could cut inside, contribute to overloads centrally, and allow Liverpool to build through him when needed. Should Liverpool sign a defensive midfielder in the mould of Adam Wharton or Aurélien Tchouaméni, the team could support both full-backs pushing forward while still protecting the central spine. In this configuration, Salah plays closer to the goal, supported by a runner—perhaps someone like Jonathan David, Santiago Giménez, or even a younger emerging option.\n\nThis season in Europe's top 5 leagues: Most goals — Mo Salah\n\nMost assists — Mo Salah\n\nMost G/A — Mo Salah Dominant. pic.twitter.com/6a5dVMyM8p — StatMuse FC (@statmusefc) April 24, 2025\n\nSuch a move would also open the door to a creative addition in the No.10 mould—Florian Wirtz remains of huge interest and would be a natural fit in a hybrid midfield, whether from the left or tucked in behind a forward line.\n\nFormation Shift or Just Evolution?\n\nWhether Slot fully implements a 4-4-2 or simply leans on it situationally, the club appears ready to pivot from the positional framework that defined the Klopp era. With Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes overseeing the rebuild, this isn’t just about new players—it’s about new combinations, new automatisms, and a team less reliant on individual brilliance to solve structural problems.\n\nThe 4-3-3 that powered Liverpool’s dominance may still appear in moments, but with Diaz potentially departing, Trent possibly moving on, and a new front line being sculpted, Slot’s blueprint may require a bolder structural reset. A two-striker system anchored by Salah could offer just that—fresh problems for opposition defences and a more balanced Liverpool for the seasons ahead.\n\nThe summer transfer window won’t just be about who comes in—it will be about who the new Liverpool becomes. And if that side takes the field in a 4-4-2, it may not be nostalgia—it may be evolution."}

Arsenal’s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace midweek has capped their potential at 79 points — a figure Liverpool could surpass even with a draw this Sunday. Slot’s Reds have been relentless, racking up 26 wins from 33 games and averaging 2.39 points per match.\n\nIt’s been an emphatic campaign, one defined not just by wins but by the manner in which they’ve been achieved.\n\nTottenham Task Offers Favourable Conditions\n\nTottenham’s current form and fixture congestion could make things easier for Liverpool. The North London side sit 16th in the Premier League and are burdened with Europa League semi-final responsibilities. With rotation likely and motivation potentially split, Anfield could see a weakened Spurs XI.\n\nIt doesn’t help Ange Postecoglou’s side that Liverpool have already hit them for ten goals across league and cup competitions this season. Add to that Liverpool’s 15-match unbeaten streak against Spurs at home, and the odds shift further in the hosts’ favour.\n\nMohamed Salah will once again be central. The Egyptian has 15 career goals against Spurs and is three goal involvements away from breaking the Premier League’s single-season record. Sunday offers a fitting stage.\n\nSlot Hits Back at “Weak League” Talk\n\nAmid the build-up, Slot has responded to whispers that this Premier League season has lacked quality — a critique often levelled when one side dominates so completely.\n\n“Everyone can have your opinion, and where we live it’s a positive thing you can share it with everyone. As long as it comes from their own idea, that’s the nice thing,” he said.\n\n“I can only tell you what I’ve experienced this season and can say it’s never been as exciting for a top-five finish.”\n\n“In my opinion it’s a really difficult league, there’s not an easy game. But that tells you something about us.”\n\n“But we’re not the only team to find it hard to win a game by two or three goals. Maybe Liverpool and City and Arsenals aren’t as good, or the other teams have got better.”\n\nLegacy and Leverage for Slot\n\nWhile the final whistle on Sunday may mark the clinching of silverware, it could also represent a broader shift under Slot. Any suggestion that Liverpool’s success is circumstantial rather than systemic underestimates the cohesion, intensity, and evolution Slot has instilled.\n\nYes, the competition may be inconsistent, but this Liverpool side have done more than ride that wave — they’ve defined the standard."}

After a quiet stint at Norwich City, where he made just 10 appearances and scored once, the winger was recalled by Liverpool in January and quickly loaned back out — this time to Portsmouth.\n\nYet, Gordon’s fortunes have only declined. The 19-year-old has struggled for game time at Fratton Park, making just four substitute appearances. Despite Portsmouth having now secured their Championship status with two games remaining, Mousinho’s recent remarks make it clear that Gordon is far from guaranteed any late-season minutes.\n\nMousinho’s Comments Reflect Performance Frustrations\n\nSpeaking ahead of Portsmouth’s upcoming fixture against Sheffield Wednesday, Mousinho was candid about his squad selection process — and Gordon’s exclusion.\n\n“I am not sure about team selection yet. There are going to be a lot of conversations around what we do on Saturday, but we still want to win the games, so that’s an important factor,” said the Pompey manager.\n\n“We will take a view on all of those things, try to put a strong squad, look at opportunities which we might need to give players and go from there. We’ve had, all of a sudden, in the past few weeks, 25 fit players to choose from at times. It has left some players who have been really good this year for us, unfortunately, out of the squad, but the most important thing is for us to pick up results.”\n\nIt’s telling that Gordon, a former England youth international once touted as Liverpool’s next breakout star, finds himself on the outside looking in. Injuries hampered his progress significantly over the past 18 months, but it now seems that concerns around his performance and consistency are just as pressing.\n\nPathway Blocked at Liverpool Under Slot?\n\nAt Liverpool, opportunities for young attacking players are increasingly limited. Under new manager Arne Slot, there’s a growing emphasis on tactical discipline and intensity — qualities Gordon has yet to prove consistently at senior level. With the likes of Ben Doak, Stefan Bajcetic, and Lewis Koumas impressing in their loan spells or breaking into the fringes of the first team, the pressure is on.\n\nGordon’s name no longer features in development conversations with the same frequency as it once did. His limited impact at Portsmouth — a team that has fought relegation for much of the campaign — will not help his cause heading into the summer.\n\nHonesty From Portsmouth, But What Next for Gordon?\n\nMousinho’s final remarks offered some sympathy but little encouragement:\n\n“Kaide and Mark (O’Mahony) have taken it really well. I have tried to be honest with them about what I think they can do better with performances and why they have found themselves out of the squad. Some of it is about a bit of luck as well, with it also being crunch time at this time of the season. We’re just going to have to make decisions which we think are going to help the team.”\n\nIn truth, Liverpool now face a critical decision: Does Gordon still fit the long-term vision at Anfield, or has his development stalled beyond retrieval?\n\nA permanent move might offer him a clearer path and less pressure, while Liverpool could reinvest in more consistent emerging talent. Either way, the clock is ticking — and Gordon may have already played his final game in Liverpool red."}

Arsenal fans, once again, find themselves playing the role of nearly men, and rather than facing up to the uncomfortable truth of finishing second again, they’ve opted for the greatest hits of denial: refereeing conspiracies, fixture complaints, injuries that all clubs encounter, and the ever-bizarre obsession with Liverpool.\n\nThis would mark the ninth time Arsenal have finished as runners-up in the Premier League era—an astonishingly consistent return for a club that’s so often allergic to trophies. But in this current run-in, the bitterness has boiled over to incredible levels. For a fanbase that prides itself on class and history, there’s an alarming lack of humility when the table doesn’t reflect their narrative.\n\nThe PGMOL Plot That Never Was\n\nIf you’ve spent more than five minutes in Arsenal Twitter’s echo chamber lately, you’d think Howard Webb personally intervenes every weekend to keep the Gunners trophy-less. Amongst the propaganda, there’s apparently a laundry list of perceived injustices—but none quite enough to justify the reality: Arsenal have dropped points when it mattered most. Again. This is not a new story or tale, but a common reality that is rolled out throughout each and every season under the watch of Mikel Arteta.\n\nBlaming the PGMOL has become a weekly tradition, despite Arsenal having received a favourable VAR call or two themselves. The truth is that conspiracies are easier to digest than accepting the occasional tactical blunder or attacking no-show. The alternative is admitting that Liverpool, despite injuries, transition, and a managerial farewell tour, simply outperformed them. The hours that were spent on the Arsenal training ground perfecting set pieces may well have garnered some success, yet it is surely detrimental when building a fluid side to win major trophies.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/thearsenalinme/status/1915448538437214675?s=46&t=rxgukmqdoXc4muVFLSx2EQ\n\nLiverpool Did the Talking With Points, Not Posts\n\nWhile Arteta’s men have impressed in spells, the table doesn’t lie. Liverpool have led the way in consistency, mental fortitude, and—when needed—sheer grit. This is a team that lost their world-famous manager last summer, reshaped the entire executive level, weathered a transition of styles and stewardship, and still might lift the title with four games to spare.\n\nArsenal’s response to pressure? A flurry of post-match pressers where Arteta bemoaned, well, anything but his own decisions. Meanwhile, Liverpool—despite being told they were “in decline” by rival fans—has stitched together one of the most balanced and dynamic campaigns of the modern era, all while navigating a managerial succession in real-time.\n\nAnd for all the chatter about officiating and favouritism, Liverpool’s lead at the top is earned—not handed. It’s built on late winners, squad depth, and a refusal to cave under pressure. That, not Twitter trends or ‘what if’ scenarios, is what titles are made of.\n\nArteta’s Billion-Pound Bridesmaids\n\nIf spending were a trophy, Arsenal would have at least three open-top parades by now. Since taking charge, Mikel Arteta has been handed nearly £800 million to shape his squad. That’s not just investment—that’s transformative backing. Yet here we are, with another second-place medal likely to be polished for the Emirates cabinet of moral victories.\n\nDeclan Rice, £105m. Kai Havertz, £65m. Benjamin White, £50m. That’s just the start. The Gunners have built a talented team, no doubt—but there’s a difference between assembling quality and delivering under pressure. Arsenal are great when it’s flowing. Liverpool are great when it’s chaos. That’s the gap.\n\nAnd when that difference plays out over 38 games, it tends to show up in the table—no matter how many graphics are posted to convince you otherwise.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jattsoprano316/status/1915362344378528124?s=46&t=rxgukmqdoXc4muVFLSx2EQ\n\nFinal Thought:\n\nSo if Liverpool do wrap it up against Spurs at Anfield this weekend, don’t expect apologies from Arsenal fans. Expect more conspiracies, more victimhood, and more coping. But remember this: titles aren’t awarded by sympathy or social media pressure—they’re earned over the long haul. And Liverpool? They’ve simply earned it."}

Sunday’s clash with Tottenham Hotspur isn’t just another fixture – it’s the moment the red half of Merseyside has been waiting for. With a superior goal difference and a game in hand on Arsenal, only a single point is needed to confirm Liverpool as champions.\n\nSlot’s side have combined resilience, tactical clarity and individual brilliance throughout the season, and now stand on the cusp of their 20th top-flight crown. The Dutchman has rotated shrewdly, relied on squad depth, and maintained focus through a relentless campaign.\n\nTottenham Teetering on the Edge\n\nWhile Liverpool prepare the confetti, Tottenham arrive in turmoil. Ange Postecoglou’s men have stumbled into Anfield off the back of consecutive defeats to Wolves and Nottingham Forest. More worryingly, their trajectory suggests a possible finish as low as 17th – an unthinkable outcome for a side that harboured top-four ambitions.\n\nPostecoglou’s early optimism has been eclipsed by inconsistency and vulnerability, particularly away from home. Injuries haven’t helped. While Kevin Danso’s return offers some encouragement, Radu Dragusin is ruled out and the potential absence of Heung-min Son – who has missed the last three matches with a foot issue – leaves Tottenham dangerously short of firepower.\n\nAs it stands, only a sharp tactical rethink or inspired individual display can prevent a third successive Premier League defeat.\n\nTitle in Sight, Squad Nearly Intact\n\nArne Slot heads into this crucial encounter with the benefit of a near-fully fit squad. The only major absentee remains Joe Gomez, whose availability for the remainder of the season is uncertain. But otherwise, Liverpool boast a settled, confident line-up ready to handle the pressure of expectation.\n\nA return to Anfield for a potential title-clincher adds another layer to the occasion. The crowd will undoubtedly play its part in generating the kind of atmosphere that makes the stadium one of football’s most feared fortresses.\n\nAs for Tottenham, their own preparations are further complicated by an upcoming European fixture. Fatigue, both mental and physical, could be a factor – and one Liverpool are likely to exploit.\n\nPrediction and Kick-Off Details\n\nKick-off is set for 4.30pm BST on Sunday, April 27, 2025, with the match broadcast live on Sky Sports in the UK.\n\nScore prediction: Liverpool 4-1 Tottenham\n\nHead-to-Head Stats\n\nLiverpool wins: 83\n\nDraws: 42\n\nTottenham wins: 45\n\nWhile history leans in Liverpool’s favour, it’s current form that tells the story – and it reads like a final chapter written in red ink."}

According to A Bola, the Reds owe former club Benfica the sum should Nunez make one more Premier League start—bringing his total to 50 in the competition.\n\nThe striker, who arrived at Anfield in 2022 for a base fee of £64 million with add-ons potentially pushing the total package to £85 million, has so far made 49 league starts. He has also netted important goals across domestic and European competitions, though questions around consistency remain part of the wider debate about his overall value.\n\nLiverpool have reportedly already paid Benfica €10 million in performance-related bonuses, with clauses linked to appearance counts in both the Premier League and Champions League. But the suggestion that Liverpool may deliberately withhold the 25-year-old from the starting XI to avoid further financial obligations has triggered heated discussion.\n\nSlot Dismisses Payment Clause Influence\n\nSpeaking ahead of Liverpool’s clash with Tottenham, manager Arne Slot was asked directly about the reports and offered a candid, and at times humorous, response.\n\n“Do you always believe what journalists say? Not always? Me neither,” Slot said with a smile.\n\n“Sometimes you should, sometimes you shouldn’t believe what is written about players. It’s completely new to me.”\n\nSlot went on to clarify the dynamics between coaching staff and the club’s football operations department, effectively distancing his decision-making from financial clauses.\n\n“Normally sporting director is judged on players come in, the last, last, last thing he would do is tell me if you play him it would cost us this much… he’d never, never do that.”\n\n“He never interferes with the line-up. It might be true, but if a journalist says it we have to balance it…”\n\nLiverpool’s Tactical Priorities Over Transfer Terms\n\nSlot’s comments underscore a broader truth about elite football: top-level managers rarely allow commercial incentives to override tactical planning. Liverpool, chasing key objectives under Slot’s first full season at the helm, will be expected to continue selecting players based on merit, availability, and opponent analysis.\n\nDarwin Nunez, while not without flaws, remains a powerful outlet in Liverpool’s attacking framework. With Mohamed Salah and Luis Díaz offering different dynamics, Nunez provides direct running, physical presence and an unpredictability that unsettles defences—particularly in matches against high lines like Spurs or Manchester City.\n\nSpotlight on Transparency and Trust\n\nThis moment also shines a light on how information—true, speculative, or misinterpreted—travels across borders and influences fan discourse. Slot’s frank tone reinforces the need for clarity and communication from those in charge, especially when dealing with high-profile names like Nunez.\n\nWhether or not the €5 million clause becomes a factor in the coming weeks, it seems clear that Liverpool’s focus under Arne Slot remains performance-driven—not payment-driven."}

It’s been a long time coming, with iPad power users pleading with Apple to make the tablet more powerful.\n\nThis report is intriguing, but frustratingly vague. Apple wanting to tinker with iPad multitasking and app window management is dog-bites-man stuff at this point. Gurman’s report didn’t offer any real specifics, so we’re left to guess about what Apple might do to make changes that would “make a lot of [iPad power] users happy.”\n\nOn Thursday, purveyor of Apple rumors Majin Bu reported some interesting details:\n\nOne of the most exciting changes will benefit those using the iPad with a Magic Keyboard. When connected, the interface will adapt to show a menu bar at the top, just like on macOS, turning the iPad into a much more laptop-like experience. Another key update is Stage Manager 2.0, an enhanced multitasking mode that activates automatically when the keyboard is attached. It will make managing apps and windows smoother and more productive than ever.\n\nThe idea of adding a “laptop mode” that alters the iPad interface when a keyboard is attached is a good one. That’s a strong signal that the iPad is in a context that would welcome more affordances for keyboard and pointing devices—while not burdening users who just want to use the iPad as a touch tablet.\n\nApple has been building to this on iOS for quite some time now, most notably with changes made in iPadOS 15. I wrote about it back in 2021:\n\nApple is rebuilding the Mac menu bar on the iPad, and it’s doing it in plain sight. Hold down the Globe or Command keys in iPadOS 15, and you’ll see an overlay that lists all the available keyboard shortcuts—organized in a quite familiar pattern that begins with File and Edit. You don’t even need to use keyboard shortcuts—tapping on any command will execute it… Would Apple ever offer a proper Mac-style menu bar on the iPad? I think it might, in the proper contexts. Perhaps only when a keyboard and pointing device are attached, or only on an external display that has to be entirely driven by those input methods. But it’s not as if the iPad isn’t already most of the way there. The iPad’s status bar displays time, date, and a bunch of icons already—they’d be at home in a Mac-style menu bar. Toss in icons for Control Center and Notification Center if you want.\n\nI don’t know if Bu’s sources are good on this or not, but if it is true, it would definitely fit into Gurman’s report that iPadOS 19 will make the iPad work more like a Mac when it’s in the proper context. Context is everything here. Regular iPad users don’t need to see this stuff—but if the device can adapt when snapped into a Magic Keyboard, all the better.\n\nIf you appreciate articles like this one, support us by becoming a Six Colors subscriber.

As I sat quietly in his hospice room alongside my grandma and other family members, his nurse smiled softly and said, “I can see he lived well. People his age often pass just the way they lived.”\n\nAnd as I drove home that evening a couple questions kept cycling through my mind…\n\n“Am I living well?”\n\n“What do I want to be able to smile about on the inside when I’m close to the end?”\n\nThese questions are tough, especially the second one. At the time, I struggled to fully accept my own mortality — just thinking about it stressed me out. So I simply avoided the question and the soul-searching it demanded of me. I distracted myself for a few more years until I found myself back in a hospice room with my 90-year-old grandma (who was the most amazing human being I’ve ever met, by the way).\n\nOn the final day of her life, I sat with my grandma for the entire day, in silence, in laughter, in tears, and in awe of a woman who was still smiling and sharing stories despite incredible weakness and exhaustion. Her mind was amazingly strong even just a few short hours before her death. So I gave her my undivided attention — I soaked up her wisdom one last time.\n\nAnd I was all ears until she asked me a version of that question I had avoided a few years earlier. “Do you know why I’m smiling right now?” she asked me.\n\n“Because you lived well,” I said.\n\nShe smiled even wider, and then she spent the next hour speaking softly and passionately about her life and the reasons for her present happiness. It was without a doubt one of the most enlightening and unforgettable hours of my life. Immediately afterward, she took a nap — one of her final naps — and I wrote a journal entry about everything she spoke of.\n\nAlthough I’ve shared many of her insights and quotes with readers and clients in the past, today is the anniversary of my grandma’s passing, so I’d like to honor her once more. To do so, I’m going to share an expanded version of the notes from that specific journal entry I wrote in her hospice room just over a decade ago. It’s her wisdom with my twist. I’ve done my best to convey what she told me in five inspiring points — the five reasons my grandma smiled genuinely on her final day:\n\n1. My grandma never talked herself out of doing her thing.\n\nOne of my grandma’s favorite quotes was by Walt Disney: “Around here, we don’t look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we’re curious — and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.”\n\nIt inspired my grandma for decades, and it still inspires me every day to write and create — to move on to my next piece of work, even when I catch myself judging my last piece of work as “not good enough.”\n\nFor example, it’s been 18 years now that Angel and I have been publishing new articles every week on Marc & Angel Hack Life. Sometimes the ideas and words come easier than others, and there have been plenty of times when I’ve felt like my writing and work was sub-par.\n\n“I thought this was a great article. Why aren’t people reading and sharing it?” Or I’ll feel like I fumbled through an article only to watch it receive thousands of shares on social media. Regardless of which outcome I’m dealing with, my grandma’s wisdom always reminds me of one key point: As human beings, we are often terrible judges of our own work. We are just too self-critical to see the truth most of the time.\n\nAnd not only that, it’s not our job to judge our own work. It’s not our job to compare it to everyone else’s work, or to how we thought others would perceive it. There’s no use in doing that.\n\nInstead, it’s our job to create. Our job is to share what we have right now in this moment. Our job is to come as we are and give it our best shot, every single day. That’s how my grandma lived her life. She was a true artist in that way.\n\nRealize that there are people in nearly every career field who make each day a work of art simply by the way they have mastered their craft. Yes, almost everyone is an artist in some way. And every artist will have the tendency to judge their own work. The important thing is to not let your self-judgment talk you out of doing your thing and sharing your creative and unique gifts with the world.\n\nJust like Walt said, the key is to “keep moving forward.”\n\n2. My grandma vividly remembered persevering through life’s challenges.\n\nSadly, most people give up on their life stories far too early. They come out of school or college wanting to change the world, wanting to build an enterprise, wanting to make lots of money, wanting to start a family and live happily ever after. But they get into the middle of it all and discover it’s way harder than they anticipated. They encounter many setbacks, and they can’t see anything over the distant horizon anymore. So they wonder if their efforts are moving them forward. None of the trees behind them are getting smaller and none of the ones ahead are getting larger, at least not fast enough. So they take it out on their family and friends, or themselves, and they go aimlessly looking for an easier path that doesn’t fulfill them.\n\nDon’t be one of these people.\n\nMy grandma had a Winston Churchill quote hanging in her home office that said, “Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.”\n\nAnd she strongly believed that good things don’t come easy. “True strength consists of what you do on the third, fourth and fifth tries,” she told me. Take this to heart!\n\nNever give up on your journey. Never stop trying. Never sell out or sell yourself short. Life is tough, but you are tougher. Your journey isn’t supposed to be easy, it’s supposed to be worth it. To never struggle is to never grow. It doesn’t matter what’s happened or what you’ve done; what matters is what you choose to do from here. Accept the circumstances, learn from them, and take another step forward.\n\n3. My grandma spent much of her life focused on the present, appreciating the little things.\n\n“Remember, you don’t know what the future will bring. So your best bet for living is to make the best and most positive use of the present,” my grandma said.\n\nThe universe is always talking to us — sending us little messages, causing coincidences and serendipitous events, reminding us to stop, to look around, and to believe in something special, something more.\n\nBut this special something isn’t somewhere else. It’s right where you are.\n\nSometimes you have to stop searching, and just BE. You aren’t missing anything anywhere else. You’re only missing the goodness in front of you.\n\nLet me assure you, you could run around trying to do everything, and travel around the world, and always stay connected, and work and party all night long without sleep, but you could never do it all. You will always be missing something, and thus it will always seem like something amazing might be happening elsewhere. Focusing on this is obviously futile.\n\nHustle, work hard, and seek adventure, but do it with your eyes wide open and focused on your present step.\n\nYou have everything right now. The best in life isn’t somewhere else — it’s right where you are at this moment. Notice it, and make it memorable.\n\n4. My grandma had the peace of mind that comes with letting go.\n\nThis point is a perfect successor to the previous one. Letting go isn’t about having the ability to forget the past, it’s about having the wisdom to embrace the present.\n\nTruth be told, the more you talk about it, debate it, rethink it, rehash it, cross-analyze it, get paranoid about it, track it, respond to it, contend with it, complain about it, immortalize it, cry over it, kick it, insult it, gossip about it, pray over it, put it down or dissect its motives… it continues to fester and rot in your mind.\n\nIt’s time to accept that it’s over! It’s dead! It’s gone. It’s done. It’s time to bury it because it’s stinking up your life, and no one wants to be near your rotted corpse of bad memories, or your decaying attitude. Be the funeral director of your past life and bury that thing once and for all!\n\n“Every difficult life situation can be an excuse for hopelessness or an opportunity for growth, depending on what you choose to do with it right now,” my grandma told me. “We have to let go of the ideas, outcomes, and expectations that aren’t serving us.”\n\nTake pause when you must. Realize that holding on is being brave, but letting go and moving forward is often what makes us stronger and happier in the end. Give yourself this gift so you can grow and smile again, and again. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the Happiness and Adversity chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)\n\n5. My grandma was well-read and incredibly generous with her knowledge.\n\nMy grandma’s personal heroes were educated visionaries and dreamers — those beautiful people among us who invest in themselves and then use what they’ve learned to make the world a better place than when they found it, whether in tiny ways or enormous ones. Some succeed, some fail, most have mixed results, but it’s the effort itself that’s heroic, as she saw it. Win or lose, my grandma admired those who intelligently fight for the greater good. And I couldn’t agree more with her sentiment.\n\nDon’t stop learning. Don’t stop investing in yourself. Study. Read. Devour books. Engage with people, including those who think differently. Ask questions. Listen closely. And don’t just grow in knowledge. Be a person who gives back. Use what you’re learning to make a difference.\n\nAs Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “The purpose of life is not to simply be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.”\n\nClosing Thoughts: A Benediction\n\nI want to leave you with a paraphrased version of a poem by Bessie Anderson Stanley that my grandma used to have hanging on the side of her refrigerator when I was growing up. I think it perfectly embodies the overall message of this essay, and the overall reason my grandma was smiling:\n\n“She has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much;\n\nWho has enjoyed the trust of good women, the respect of good men, and the love of children;\n\nWho has filled her niche and accomplished her task;\n\nWho has never lacked appreciation of life’s beauty or failed to express it;\n\nWho has left the world better than she found it,\n\nWhether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;\n\nWho has always looked for the best in others and given them the best she had;\n\nWhose life was an inspiration;\n\nWhose memory a benediction.”\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nAngel and I would love to hear from YOU.

Harbor Freight Tools USA, Inc.:\n\nPlaintiff purchased a splitting maul (an axe specially designed for splitting wood) from defendant in 2017. Several months later, while plaintiff was hanging the maul to store it, the head of the tool detached and struck plaintiff, causing injuries to his nose and left eye. Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit in 2020, alleging that the head detached due to a design defect; defendant asserts the product failed due to plaintiff's misuse, which it contends is evidenced by a large crack in the handle….\n\nTo support his defective design claim, plaintiff seeks to offer expert testimony by Mark Lehnert, who identifies himself as a \"consultant with products and liability history, extensive knowledge and experience in manufacturing and assembly, [and] mechanical and electrical engineering management.\" Lehnert holds no engineering degrees, yet reports extensive experience designing and manufacturing power tools, holds over a dozen patents, and has worked in management positions in engineering departments at several corporations over a period of decades.\n\nLehnert contends the maul used by plaintiff was defectively designed because the handle and head were weakly bound with adhesive, leading to the accident. He opines that good design requires securely attaching the head and handle by \"drilling a small diameter hole through the side of the maul, into and through the handle\" and placing an aluminum pin \"through the head\" to reduce the possibility of separation. Lehnert's report references several other mauls currently available for purchase that incorporate such a pin….\n\nDefendant moves to preclude Lehnert's testimony, arguing that he is unqualified as an expert because he lacks engineering degrees, and his experience is limited to designing power tools rather than manual tools. Defendant further argues that Lehnert's opinion is unreliable because (i) he did not rely on any scientific, technical, or trade articles in preparing his report, and (ii) after completing the report, he entered a query into ChatGPT about the best way to secure a hammer head to a handle, which produced a response consistent with his expert opinion…."}

These five hacks can help you unlock hidden potential, allowing you to customize, optimize, and personalize your device. Whether you’re a tech-savvy enthusiast or simply looking for ways to simplify your daily tasks, these tips are designed to enhance functionality and improve your overall experience. The video below from iReviews gives us more details on a range of iPhone hacks you can try out.\n\n1. Hide the Dock Background for a Sleek Look\n\nFor those who appreciate a minimalist aesthetic, hiding the dock background on your home screen is a simple yet impactful way to create a cleaner interface. By using apps like “Docland”, you can remove the default dock appearance, resulting in a seamless and polished design. Pair this with a carefully chosen wallpaper to blend the dock into your background, achieving a cohesive and distraction-free look. This hack is ideal for users who value simplicity and want their home screen to feel more refined.\n\n2. Automate Battery Management with a Shortcut\n\nBattery management doesn’t have to be a hassle. With the help of a custom shortcut, you can automate key aspects of your iPhone’s battery usage. For instance, you can create a shortcut that estimates the time required to fully charge your device or sends notifications when your battery reaches specific levels, such as 80%. This feature is particularly useful for avoiding overcharging, which can help prolong your battery’s lifespan. By automating these tasks, you save time and ensure your device remains in optimal condition.\n\n3. Personalize Your Lock Screen with Custom Text\n\nYour lock screen is the first thing you see when you pick up your phone, so why not make it uniquely yours? Using the Focus mode settings, you can add a personal touch by displaying custom text such as your name, a motivational quote, or an important reminder. You can even include an icon in the status bar for added flair. This feature not only enhances personalization but also keeps essential messages or inspirations front and center, making your iPhone feel more tailored to your preferences.\n\n4. Link Notes for Better Organization\n\nThe Notes app is a powerful tool that can be further enhanced by using its hyperlinking capabilities. By linking related notes, you can create a network of interconnected information that’s easy to navigate. For example, if you’re managing a project, you can link notes containing research, ideas, and to-do lists, allowing you to access all relevant details with just a tap. This feature is particularly useful for streamlining workflows and keeping your notes organized. Additionally, you can edit or remove links as needed, making sure your system remains flexible and efficient.\n\n5. Use Hidden Widgets for a Clean Home Screen\n\nTransparent widgets are an excellent solution for users who want a clean and organized home screen without sacrificing functionality. Apps like “MD Blank” allow you to create invisible widgets that blend seamlessly with your wallpaper. These widgets can be hidden or revealed as needed, giving you quick access to essential tools while maintaining a minimalist design. Whether you prioritize aesthetics or practicality, this hack provides the flexibility to customize your layout to suit your needs and preferences.\n\nExplore further guides and articles from our vast library that you may find relevant to your interests in iPhone customization hacks.\n\nSource & Image Credit: iReviews\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

Rating: About this rating Mixture What's True Although the original image held by Trump in the photo was genuine, it had been edited to insert the text \"MS-13\" above the symbols tattooed on Abrego Garcia's hand. What's False There is no clear evidence proving a link between Abrego Garcia's hand tattoos and MS-13.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump posted a photo on X and Truth Social supposedly showing proof that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who immigrated to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador in 2012 then was detained and deported by the Trump administration in March 2025, was a member of the MS-13 gang .\n\nIn the photo, Trump can be seen holding a piece of paper featuring a separate picture purportedly showing the tattoos across Abrego Garcia's hand.\n\n(X user @realDonaldTrump)\n\nOther users shared a cropped version of the photograph showing a close-up of the tattoos:\n\n(X user @WesternDecline_)\n\nOn April 29, in an interview with ABC News' Terry Moran, Trump repeatedly referenced the claim that Abrego Garcia had \"MS-13\" tattooed on his hand, saying it proved he was a gang member.\n\nSnopes readers searched the site and wrote to us asking if the photograph was real and if it proved Abrego Garcia was affiliated with MS-13. While publicly available evidence confirmed the image shared by Trump was authentic in origin, it also confirmed that the image had been altered to insert the text \"MS-13\" above the actual tattoos — in effect annotating them. There was no clear evidence the symbols on Abrego Garcia's fingers proved an affiliation with MS-13.\n\nAbrego Garcia was mistakenly detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on March 12, 2025. According to CASA, an immigration advocacy organization involved in Abrego Garcia's legal defense, he had no criminal convictions in either the U.S. or El Salvador. In 2019, a judge ordered that he not be returned to El Salvador on the grounds that he would face persecution. Three days after his detainment in 2025, however, the government sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center prison, or CECOT, without a hearing, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe Trump administration itself called his detention and removal an \" administrative error .\"\n\nEven after acknowledging it had made a mistake, however, the administration repeatedly claimed that it ordered Abrego Garcia be sent to the Salvadoran mega-prison because he was a member of MS-13. (Snopes previously investigated the little evidence the administration has used to justify Abrego Garcia's gang affiliation and concluded there was not sufficient evidence to prove he was in the gang.) Trump shared the photograph as supposed proof of such a connection, and the post's caption claimed Abrego Garcia had \"MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles.\"\n\nOther photos of Abrego Garcia provided confirmation that he has four knuckle tattoos, as shown in the picture held by Trump. Trump's picture had been edited to add the text \"MS-13\" above the tattoos, but there was no actual evidence demonstrating a link between the tattoos and the El Salvadoran gang.\n\nTrump's photo of the tattoos was edited, likely in an attempt to add context\n\nThe photo held by Trump shows four knuckle tattoos — a marijuana leaf, a smiley face with X's for eyes, a crucifix and a skull. We confirmed the existence of these tattoos on Abrego Garcia's hand by cross-checking with other images of him. Two separate photos in USA Today stories (one came from El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele's social media and the other was credited to CASA) featured the knuckle tattoos, although only the skull and cross were visible in one of them.\n\nHowever, Trump's \"proof\" also contained \"MS13\" spelled across the knuckles and a description of the four tattoos underneath — \"marijuana, smile, cross, skull.\" When Moran pushed back against Trump in the ABC News interview (at timestamp 22:00), Trump made it clear he believed the text \"MS-13\" present above the symbols was real, not annotated with editing software.\n\n\"It says M-S-one-three,\" he told Moran.\n\nThose elements were not present in the other photos in the USA Today articles, indicating they were added to Trump's photo after the fact. Moran tried to move on by saying the tattoos could be \"interpreted\" as connecting Abrego Garcia to MS-13 (this is not really true, as we'll see in the next section), but Trump did not budge.\n\n\"He had MS as clear as you can be. Not 'interpreted,'\" Trump said.\n\nMoran pointed out that other photos of Abrego Garcia clearly showed he did not literally have the gang's name tattooed on his knuckles. Trump still refused to acknowledge he was wrong.\n\n\"He's got MS-13 on his knuckles,\" he said.\n\nDespite what the president claimed, Abrego Garcia did not have the gang's name literally \"tattooed onto his knuckles.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia's tattoos did not match known MS-13 tattoos\n\nSnopes reached out to several experts in gang tattoos to learn more about the symbolism in MS-13 tattoos and whether Abrego Garcia's tattoos matched those symbols. We also reached out to ICE for comment. We had not heard back from any of them at the time of publishing.\n\nLooking at other photos of MS-13 gang tattoos, however, revealed that members of the gang have its name literally tattooed on their bodies in some form, generally an \"MS,\" a \"13\" or both. A source from ICE reportedly told the New York Post that if Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13, getting such a tattoo would have been a requirement. However, Snopes was unable to independently verify this claim.\n\nIf MS-13 members are required to have a rather blatant \"MS\" or \"13\" tattoo and if Abrego Garcia was actually involved with the gang, the Trump administration would presumably be able to share a photo of such a tattoo. The fact that the four knuckle tattoos, none of which were \"MS13,\" were the supposed proof undermined the administration's claim of his affiliation with the gang.\n\nThe ICE source who reportedly spoke to the New York Post also said he had \"never heard of those resemblances being made\" when asked if Abrego Garcia's knuckle tattoos signified membership in MS-13.\n\nRegardless of whether Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13 or not, the U.S. Constitution grants him the right to due process and the Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration on April 10 to \"facilitate\" his return. As of this writing, the administration had not complied with the ruling."}

In this demo, we'll focus on how event filters can help clean up and simplify event data, making automation easier to manage. Specifically, we'll explore the ansible.eda.dashes_to_underscores event filter and how it works.\n\nWhen using Ansible EDA with tools like webhooks, Prometheus, or cloud services, events often come in as JSON data. These JSON payloads usually have keys with dashes in their names, like alert-name or instance-id. While this is fine in JSON, it becomes a problem in Ansible because variable names with dashes can't be used directly in playbooks or Jinja2 templates. The dashes_to_underscores filter helps solve this issue by converting those dashed keys into names that Ansible can work with more easily.\n\nThe dashes_to_underscores filter in Ansible EDA automatically replaces dashes ( - ) in all keys of an event payload with underscores ( _ ). This transformation ensures that variable names conform to Ansible's requirements, making them easier to reference directly in conditions and playbooks.\n\nTesting the dashes_to_underscores Filter with a Webhook\n\nTo demonstrate how the ansible.eda.dashes_to_underscores filter operates, we'll send a sample JSON payload to a webhook running on port 9000 . This payload includes keys with dashes, such as alert-name and instance-id , which are common in JSON data but can pose challenges in Ansible due to variable naming conventions.\n\nwebhook.yml\n\nYAML - name: Event Filter dashes_to_underscores demo hosts: localhost sources: - ansible.eda.webhook: port: 9000 host: 0.0.0.0 filters: - ansible.eda.dashes_to_underscores: rules: - name: Run the playbook if it alert_name matches High CPU Usage condition: event.payload.alert_name == \"HighCPUUsage\" action: run_playbook: name: print-event-vars.yml\n\nprint-event-vars.yml\n\nYAML --- - name: Print the Event Details hosts: localhost gather_facts: false tasks: - name: Print event details debug: msg: > Detected that '{{ ansible_eda.event.payload.alert_name }}' on '{{ ansible_eda.event.payload.instance_id }}', current system timestp '{{ now(fmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') }}'\n\nTriggering the Webhook with a Sample JSON Payload\n\nShell curl --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --request POST \\ --data '{ \"alert-name\": \"HighCPUUsage\", \"instance-id\": \"i-123456789\" }' \\ http://localhost:9000/\n\nInspecting Events with --print-events Flag\n\nUpon receiving this payload, the dashes_to_underscores filter will automatically convert the keys: alert-name becomes alert_name and instance-id becomes instance_id\n\nThis transformation ensures compatibility with Ansible's variable naming requirements, allowing for straightforward access to these variables in your playbooks and rulebooks.\n\nJSON Ruleset: Event Filter dashes_to_underscores demo Event: {'meta': {'endpoint': '', 'headers': {'Accept': '*/*', 'Content_Length': '62', 'Content_Type': 'application/json', 'Host': 'localhost:9000', 'User_Agent': 'curl/8.7.1'}, 'received_at': '2025-04-23T16:20:40.248651Z', 'source': {'name': 'ansible.eda.webhook', 'type': 'ansible.eda.webhook'}, 'uuid': '8dcf64a6-2ab2-429b-a81a-6dd0e3a48308'}, 'payload': {'alert_name': 'HighCPUUsage', 'instance_id': 'i-123456789'}}\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ansible.eda.dashes_to_underscores filter helps clean up event data in Ansible's EDA. It automatically changes keys with dashes (like alert-name) into keys with underscores (like alert_name), making them easier to use in Ansible playbooks and rulebooks. This is important because Ansible prefers variable names that only have letters, numbers, and underscores. Using this filter makes your automation scripts clearer and reduces the chance of errors. We can also combine it with other filters, like json_filter, to better control and format incoming event data. Overall, this filter helps you work more smoothly with different types of event data in automation tasks.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this article are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer."}
