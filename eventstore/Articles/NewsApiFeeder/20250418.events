Those taken into custody in a string of high-profile student detentions captured on video have not faced any criminal charges and instead appear to have been targeted for involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. The Trump administration has said repeatedly that visas are a \"privilege\" and can be revoked at any time for a wide variety of reasons. But the crackdown appears to be far wider than initially thought, with more than 1,000 international students or recent graduates at colleges across the US now having had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed, according to a tracker from Inside Higher Ed, an online news site covering the sector. For many, the precise reasons are unknown, and universities have often only learned of the changes when checking a government-run database that logs the visa status of international students. The combination of targeted detentions and reports of wide-scale visa revocations have left campuses on edge, from the biggest public universities to elite Ivy League institutions, students and faculty told the BBC. \"I could be next,\" said one student visa-holder attending Georgetown University, who has written articles about Israel and the war in Gaza. He's begun carrying around a card in his pocket that lists his constitutional rights, in case he is ever stopped by law enforcement. Another student in Texas said he's afraid to leave his apartment, even to buy groceries. And at some colleges, departments are being hit as researchers abroad refuse to return to the US. Most students the BBC spoke to requested anonymity out of fear that having their names in the media could make them a target. The BBC has contacted the Department of Education for comment.\n\nA flyer on a bathroom stall at Georgetown University in Washington DC\n\nWatch: Moment Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi arrested by ICE\n\nHis detention followed that of Columbia University student protest organiser Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident arrested at home in New York but now awaiting deportation from a facility in Louisiana. Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who co-authored a student newspaper op-ed about Gaza and was detained in Massachusetts, is also being held in Louisiana. Last Monday, Mohsen Mahdawi, another Columbia student protester, was detained in Vermont as he attended an interview to obtain US citizenship. Like Mr Khalil, he holds a green card, rather than a student visa. \"Based on the detentions that we're seeing, I think there is a possibility anyone who has been outspoken about Palestine can be detained,\" said the Georgetown student, who knew Mr Suri. The White House says it is going after those who have been involved in activities that \"run counter\" to US national interests. In Mr Khalil's case, officials have cited a 1952 law that empowers the government to order someone deported if their presence in the country could pose unfavourable consequences for US foreign policy. In a post on X, the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association celebrated Mr Khalil's arrest, calling him the \"ringleader of chaos\" at the university.\n\nRubio on student activists: US pulled visas from 300 \"lunatics\"\n\nPolling suggests that immigration is an issue where President Trump enjoys some of his highest approval ratings, with recent Reuters and AP-NORC surveys suggesting about half of US adults approve of action in that area, several points higher than his overall rating. Universities are also being targeted at an institutional level. This week, the White House's task force on combating antisemitism froze over $2bn in funding for Harvard University, after the university refused to agree to a list of demands that it said would amount to \"surrendering its independence\". Harvard just stood up to Trump. How long can it last?\n\nTrump administration threatens Harvard with foreign student ban Trump officials have said that if Harvard doesn't comply with a request for information on certain student visaholders, it will stop granting visas to international students who want to study there. Georgetown professor Nader Hashemi said he believes the government's main goal is \"silencing dissent\" by intimidating would-be protesters. The Georgetown student says he has asked his parents not to fly from India to the US to see him graduate with a master's degree in just a few weeks. He is still unsure if he will even attend the ceremony.\n\nAn Imam at the Georgetown mosque leads prayers for Palestinians in Gaza\n\nIn addition to checking his email daily to see if he is among the hundreds that have had their visas revoked recently, he has also prepared for the possibility of sudden arrest. \"I have cleared my chats across messaging apps, and I have learned how to quickly lock my phone in SOS mode,\" he said. Georgetown professors have even begun offering spare rooms to students who worry about being visited by immigration agents at their residences, said Prof Hashemi. \"This is part of the trauma that I think students are facing,\" he said. At Tufts University, outside of Boston, Massachusetts, students are waiting to see what happens to Ms Ozturk, who was detained outside her home.\n\nWatch: Moment Tufts University student is arrested by masked immigration agents"}

Gizmodo has confirmed that the journal CHEST, a peer-reviewed publication on pulmonary care published by the American College of Chest Physicians, received a letter this week. And MedPage Today reports that at least two other journals have received similar intimidating letters.\n\nOne of the DOJ letters, signed by the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Edward R. Martin Jr., first went viral on social media Thursday and is addressed to the editor-in-chief of the journal CHEST, Dr. Peter Mazzone.\n\n“It has been brought to my attention that more and more journals and publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates,” the letter from Martin explains, “that is, that they have a position for which they are advocating either due to advertisement (under postal code) or sponsorship (under relevant fraud regulations). The public has certain expectations and you have certain responsibilities.”\n\nThe letter then goes on to list several questions, none of which are the purview of the U.S. Department of Justice, given the free speech protections afforded by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution:\n\nHow do you assess your responsibilities to protect the public from misinformation?\n\nHow do you clearly articulate to the public when you have certain viewpoints that are influenced by your ongoing relations with supporters, funders, advertisers, and others?\n\nDo you accept articles or essays from competing viewpoints?\n\nHow do you assess the role played by government officials and funding organizations like the National Institutes of Health in the development of submitted articles?\n\nHow do you handle allegations that authors of works in your journals may have misled their readers?\n\nThe letter went on to say, “I am also interested to know if publishers, journals, and organizations with which you work are adjusting their method of acceptance of competing viewpoints. Are there new norms being developed and offered?” while ending with a request for a response by May 2.\n\nReached for comment over email, a spokesperson for CHEST confirmed the letter’s authenticity, while noting, “its content was posted online without our knowledge.” The journal also posted a public statement online Friday affirming its editorial standards but didn’t address the DOJ letter specifically.\n\n“In its 90-year history, CHEST has published numerous articles that were breakthroughs in scientific research and clinical treatment, advancing the medical profession and improving the health and well-being of patients worldwide,” the journal said in a statement published online Friday.\n\nThe journal went on to stress the editorial standards the publication adheres to, including the ICMJE and COPE guidelines.\n\n“CHEST adheres to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICJME) and the COPE ethical guidelines for scholarly publishing, applying strict peer review standards to ensure scientific rigor,” the statement continued. “As the publisher, the American College of Chest Physicians respects and supports the journal’s editorial independence.”\n\nThe spokesperson told Gizmodo over email that legal counsel is currently reviewing the DOJ request, and the journal has no further comment at this time. It’s not yet clear which other journals cited by MedPage Today may have received the letters. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia didn’t immediately respond to questions over email Friday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has launched a war of retribution against perceived enemies, recently ordering the Department of Justice to investigate Chris Krebs, a cybersecurity expert whom Trump dislikes because he denied false claims by the president that the 2020 election had been rigged or stolen. Trump has also extorted several law firms for over a billion dollars in pro bono work, some of whom really regret their decisions to play ball, according to a recent report from the New York Times. Trump has also threatened to pull funding from major universities if they didn’t bend to his will, with many like Columbia University capitulating. Harvard University has pushed back, and Trump has reportedly told the IRS to strip the institution of its tax-exempt status.\n\nThe Society for the Rule of Law, a conservative legal group, has made a request to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel for the D.C. Court of Appeals for an investigation into several of Martin’s actions since he was appointed by President Trump to be the acting U.S. Attorney. Martin has announced investigations against his political opponents, tried to intimidate a law firm that represented Special Counsel Jack Smith, and has demonstrated “a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of a federal prosecutor,” according to the group.\n\nThe ACLU of D.C. also sent a letter back in February outlining its concerns about how Martin has threatened people over protected speech, specifically when the attorney promised legal action against anyone who takes actions to impede Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk has been unlawfully destroying the federal government, unilaterally dismantling entire agencies like USAID and cutting funding for vital services, despite not having the authority to do so. But Martin appeared to threaten anyone who hindered their activities, even by just speaking out against them.\n\nTrump is clearly trying to establish the U.S. as a fascist state, as he breaks vital government services, threatens American allies with invasion, and ships people convicted of no crime to a torture prison in El Salvador without due process. Trump has clearly ignored a Supreme Court order to return one man in particular from the CECOT prison, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, but the regime refuses to comply.\n\nAnd if history has taught us anything, it’s that the ideology of fascism is all-encompassing. Yes, they’re coming for the medical journals now, as ridiculous as that sounds. And every Trump supporter who thinks they’ll escape fascism’s wrath is sorely mistaken. In this kind of system, everyone is eventually made to prove their fealty to the leader. Anyone who makes a mistake or steps out of line, no matter how much they think they’ve proved themselves, will still feel the consequences."}

I was persistent, but also realistic.", "fullContent": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nEver since I was a little girl, I wanted to be a print journalist. In high school, a few teachers tried to steer me in a different direction because getting a job in the media was so difficult even then, but I was determined to make it happen.\n\nI studied for a double degree in journalism and business management and graduated in 2007. Despite the naysayers, I immediately landed a full-time cadetship job at a newspaper. I believe three things got me over the line.\n\nI did as much work experience as possible\n\nWhen I wasn't at university, I did as much work experience as I could. While my friends were busy enjoying their time off school by going to the beach or the movies, I was cutting my teeth in a newsroom. My degree required a minimum of one internship, but I wanted to do extras.\n\nI often found it super intimidating and felt out of my depth, but I gained real-world experience that proved to be invaluable. Doing work experience meant that by the time I graduated and was out there looking for a job, I already had my byline published in multiple publications and a portfolio of work to show prospective employers.\n\nIn my one and only job interview, the chief of staff wasn't interested in my university grades. In fact, I don't think he even asked about them. He wanted to see examples of my published work. The work experience I'd done definitely paid off.\n\nI persevered\n\nWhere I lived on the Gold Coast in Australia, there was only one daily newspaper, the Gold Coast Bulletin, and I was desperate to work for them.\n\nBack then, there was a scholarship program that high school seniors could apply for. It was a four-year program alternating work and study, with a guaranteed position as a newspaper journalist upon completion. Successful candidates could study for their Bachelor of Journalism at Bond University and work as a paid cadet journalist at the Gold Coast Bulletin on a semester-on, semester-off basis. I applied, but I missed out.\n\nEven though I was extremely disappointed, I didn't let it discourage me. They say that there are many pathways to the same destination, and it's so true. I went to university for four years, then reapplied for a job with the Gold Coast Bulletin in 2007.\n\nWhen I called and asked the chief of staff if they had any work available, he said they didn't. I dropped off my résumé and portfolio anyway with reception. Later that afternoon, he called me back and said to come for an interview.\n\nThe chief of staff gave me a chance and offered me a position on the copy desk, which basically involved answering phones and writing about kids' sporting achievements. It opened a door, and I was grateful that my perseverance paid off.\n\nI was realistic about having to work my way up\n\nThough the copy desk wasn't exactly where I wanted to be, the newsroom was, and I knew that I had to start somewhere.\n\nI'd also conceded that if I didn't land a job at the Gold Coast, I was willing to move elsewhere to get started in a career in journalism. I think that being flexible and having realistic expectations about working your way up to where you want to be is really important as a graduate.\n\nI ended up working at the Gold Coast Bulletin for three years, then traveling and working odd jobs while overseas. I returned to a newsroom as a print journalist in Melbourne in 2014, and then in 2015, I started my own copywriting business. Nowadays, I work from home and write freelance parenting, travel, and lifestyle articles for a range of publications. I still love my work.\n\nI always tell my kids to reach for the stars and follow their dreams, even if they seem difficult to achieve. I did, and I never looked back."}

Here's what it means for the future of tech — from AI to smartphones.", "fullContent": "On April 1, 2025, the Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC introduced the world's most advanced microchip: the 2 nanometre (2nm) chip . Mass production is expected for the second half of the year, and TSMC promises it will represent a major step forward in performance and efficiency — potentially reshaping the technological landscape.\n\nMicrochips are the foundation of modern technology, found in nearly all electronic devices, from electric toothbrushes and smartphones to laptops and household appliances. They are made by layering and etching materials like silicon to create microscopic circuits containing billions of transistors .\n\nThese transistors are effectively tiny switches, managing the flow of electricity and allowing computers to work. In general, the more transistors a chip contains, the faster and more powerful it becomes.\n\nThe microchip industry consistently endeavors to pack more transistors into a smaller area, leading to faster, more powerful, and energy efficient technological devices.\n\nCompared to the previous most advanced chip, known as 3nm chips, TSMC's 2nm technology should deliver notable benefits. These include a 10%-15% boost in computing speed at the same power level or a 20-30% reduction in power usage at the same speed.\n\nAdditionally, transistor density in 2nm chips is increased by about 15%, over and above the 3nm technology. This should enable devices to operate faster, consume less energy, and manage more complex tasks efficiently.\n\nTaiwan's microchip industry is closely tied into its security. It is sometimes referred to as the \"silicon shield\", because its widespread economic importance incentivises the US and allies to defend Taiwan against the possibility of Chinese invasion.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nRelated: China's new 2D transistor could soon be used to make the world's fastest processors\n\nTSMC recently struck a US$100 billion deal (£76 billion) to build five new US factories. However, there is uncertainty over whether the 2nm chips can be manufactured outside Taiwan , as some officials are concerned that could undermine the island's security.\n\nEstablished in 1987, TSMC, which stands for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, manufactures chips for other companies. Taiwan accounts for 60% of the global \"foundry\" market (the outsourcing of semiconductor manufacturing) and the vast majority of that comes from TSMC alone .\n\nTSMC's super-advanced microchips are used by other companies in a wide range of devices. It manufactures Apple's A-series processors used in iPhones, iPads, and Macs, it produces NVidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) used for machine learning and AI applications. It also makes AMD's Ryzen and EPYC processors used by supercomputers worldwide, and it produces Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors, used by Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus, and Google phones.\n\nIn 2020, TSMC started a special microchip miniaturization process, called 5nm FinFET technology , that played a crucial role in smartphone and high-performance computing (HPC) development. HPC is the practice of getting multiple processors to work simultaneously on complex computing problems.\n\nTwo years later, TSMC launched a 3nm miniaturization process based on even smaller microchips. This further enhanced performance and power efficiency. Apple's A-series processor, for example, is based on this technology.\n\nSmartphones, laptops and tablets with 2nm chips could benefit from better performance and longer battery life. This will lead to smaller, lighter devices without sacrificing power.\n\nThe efficiency and speed of 2nm chips has the potential to enhance AI-based applications such as voice assistants, real time language translation, and autonomous computer systems (those designed to work with minimal to no human input). Data centers could experience reduced energy consumption and improved processing capabilities, contributing to environmental sustainability goals.\n\nSectors like autonomous vehicles and robotics could benefit from the increased processing speed and reliability of the new chips, making these technologies safer and more practical for widespread adoption.\n\nThis all sounds really promising, but while 2nm chips represent a technological milestone, they also pose challenges. The first one is related to the manufacturing complexity.\n\nProducing 2nm chips requires cutting-edge techniques like extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography . This complex and expensive process increases production costs and demands extremely high precision.\n\nAnother big issue is heat. Even with relatively lower consumption, as transistors shrink and densities increase, managing heat dissipation becomes a critical challenge.\n\nOverheating can impact chip performance and durability. In addition, at such a small scale, traditional materials like silicon may reach their performance limits, requiring the exploration of different materials.\n\nThat said, the enhanced computational power, energy efficiency, and miniaturization enabled by these chips could be a gateway to a new era of consumer and industrial computing. Smaller chips could lead to breakthroughs in tomorrow's technology, creating devices that are not only powerful but also discreet and more environmentally friendly."}

Here's how to enable or disable the extensions in macOS.\n\nSpotlight is Apple's search indexing technology, which speeds up searches of data on your Mac or iOS device by storing metadata about files and their contents.\n\nFrom time to time, macOS runs a process in the background to catalog the files and data on your storage devices. This data is stored in an index that Spotlight can use to look up data when you do a search in the future.\n\nKeeping indices on your data speeds up searches and allows Spotlight to locate the data you're looking for more quickly.\n\nYou can also stop Spotlight from searching specific storage volumes or folders. You can do this by adding them to the System Settings app under the Spotlight->Search Privacy sheet.\n\nSpotlight extensions for third-party apps\n\nSome third-party macOS apps include the ability to provide their custom data to Spotlight by means of Extensions. These are small chunks of code that the app developer provides, which Spotlight can use to include custom data in its index.\n\nExtensions make Spotlight searches even faster because they tell Spotlight what data each app uses and how it is structured. By providing Spotlight Extensions, third-party apps in effect tell Spotlight how to quickly and efficiently search and index the data files those apps create.\n\nWhen you add a new app to your Mac, Spotlight Extensions are automatically added if the app includes them. These are usually included inside each app's bundle (folder) in the /Contants/Library/Spotlight folder as .mdimporter files (which themselves are bundles).\n\nEnabling/disabling Spotlight extensions for third-party apps\n\nIn macOS Sequoia, you can decide which apps' Spotlight Extensions you want enabled or disabled. Turning off a Spotlight Extension in System Settings removes the app-specific info for that app from Spotlight.\n\nYou might want to do this, for example, if you don't want Spotlight to have additional info about how certain apps' data or metadata is structured.\n\nNote that disabling a Spotlight Extension doesn't stop Spotlight from indexing those kinds of files.

But the magazine—and the world of science journalism in general—also looks radically different today than it did in, say, 1990.\n\nThat’s when today’s guest first started working at SciAm. Until his retirement earlier this month Gary Stix served as Scientific American’s senior editor of mind and brain topics. Given that Gary worked at SciAm longer than I’ve been alive, we thought it would be cool to pick his brain about how his coverage areas of technology and neuroscience have evolved over the last 35 years.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nGary, thanks so much for coming in to talk to us today.\n\nGary Stix: Well, thank you for having me.\n\nFeltman: So when did you actually start at Scientific American?\n\nStix: I started in June of 1990. I was here largely before the Internet as we know it now. We’d take the floppy disk, we’d create a printout, and that was used by the copy desk to actually edit the articles we were doing. And there always are corrections ...\n\nFeltman: [Laughs] Sure.\n\nStix: To a manuscript; one copy editor would have to read to the other the changes. So it was a very different world than the one we have now.\n\nTo put that in context there was an Internet—it was used by the government and certain academic facilities—but the time of waking up in the morning and looking at your device was far, far away.\n\nFeltman: Right, yeah [laughs]. And you started out covering technologies, is that correct?\n\nStix: Yes, Scientific American was in—its absolute pinnacle of its heyday was the whole period after the launch of Sputnik ...\n\nFeltman: Mm.\n\nStix: And the recognition that the U.S. had to up its game in science and technology. I can’t tell you how many times that, through the years, I’ve met people who’ve said, “I have every issue of Scientific American going back for 40 years. They’re all in my garage.”\n\nFeltman: [Laughs]\n\nStix: So one of the things I covered was the emergence of the Internet—or it was actually a question of how electronic communications would provide things like entertainment, news, shopping. And [laughs] at the time, it, it’s so funny to think of this now, AOL was thought of as perhaps the leading contender for being able to do that—given the position of AOL today as a very, very minor player, that is absolutely hilarious—but the peer connections of the Internet and the gradual evolution of thinking about how that peer-to-peer aspect could enable everyone in the world to communicate.\n\nI actually have a small excerpt from one of the articles that I wrote at the time ...\n\nFeltman: Oh, cool.\n\nStix: Called “Domesticating Cyberspace,” and it said, “The migration to the Internet by universities, government agencies, community organizations and even business electronic mail users is seen as stirrings of mass appeal for electronic networking beyond the automated teller machine.”\n\nSo the automated teller machine was thought of as high-tech, and very advanced technology was thought of as e-mail ...\n\nFeltman: Mm.\n\nStix: Which is so ironic given everything that’s happened in the decades since then.\n\nFeltman: Yeah, no, I remember being at a science museum somewhere in—it was maybe, at the earliest, 1994, maybe 1995, and they had a little exhibit where they were like, “This computer is connected to a computer in France. You can talk to France with this computer.” [Laughs] And it was like, “Whoa.” [Laughs]\n\nStix: Yeah, yeah.\n\nFeltman: So yeah, things have, have changed a lot.\n\nWhat are some other things that, you know, fascinated you in the ’90s in, in terms of technology coverage?\n\nStix: Well, I wrote a bunch of those trends articles, and they covered a range of technology topics, ranging from maglev trains to the need for the—an upgrade of the air traffic control system, which still needs upgrading, even after all of these ensuing decades. And I even did a story on designer concrete.\n\nIn the late 1990s I started a column on intellectual property ...\n\nFeltman: Mm.\n\nStix: Exploring questions like how to patent a gene and looked at the development of new technologies from the original idea all the way to the market. One story was “The Land of Milk and Money” that looked at genetically modified goats that even today are used to produce antithrombin, a protein that has anticoagulant properties. Another of those columns was a sensor that could detect odors better than a dog.\n\nFeltman: And these days your specialty is neuroscience. When did that start to be your beat?\n\nStix: During the 2000s there was an editor who asked us to choose particular beats, and I had written an article on cognitive enhancement and drugs for cognitive enhancement and whether cognitive enhancement, as the way people think about it, which is: “Is it possible to take your, like, ordinary daily baseline and improve upon that and be able to think and interact better by taking a drug?” And I did an article on that, and I also did another on whether, conceivably, in the future would it be possible to upload one’s brain into a computer. There had been a lot of talk about what’s called “the singularity,” in which that might at some point become possible. In both instances the answer to the questions that I was asking was largely negative. You can’t upload [laughs] your brain into a computer, and we really don’t know how to do that. And also, the idea of cognitive enhancement is very overblown and overrated.\n\nSo around the year 2010 I took on the neuroscience beat. The early years coincided with the emergence of what was called the Obama BRAIN Initiative, which was a recognition that a more formalized approach was needed to the study of the brain—more than anything, better tools were needed as well. There were basic questions that surprisingly were not answered, such as: “What are all the cell types in the brain?” People didn’t know whether there was a certain fixed number of cells of this type or that type. And that was one of the things that was being explored.\n\nAlso the wiring diagram, the way that the 100 trillion connections in the brain are connected together, that is a level of complexity that we still have not been able to parse. Ultimately, there will—maybe, at some distant date—be a wiring diagram in the whole brain, but in the interim, from the 2010s, we’ve made some progress: there has been a wiring diagram, for instance, of the insect brain. But we are still very far from having a total map of all these things. There have been cell atlases that have given us information, but something as ambitious as documenting all of the connections and how they interact with each other is still pretty far in the future.\n\nFeltman: What have some of your favorite topics in neuroscience been to cover?\n\nStix: One of them has been what sometimes are called “mini brains,” or organoids.These are clumps of stem cells that can grow into portions of the brain that are a component of the cerebral cortex, for instance. And the value of that is that they deal with some of the deficiencies of ordinary research in neuroscience, which is often focused on rodents. I mean, mice aren’t going anywhere soon; they will always be a part of neuroscience research. But there is a serious attempt with organoids to make up for some of the deficiencies of just having mice to study—I mean, mice do not get Alzheimer’s.\n\nSo in 2017 we ran an article on organoids by a researcher named Jürgen Knoblich from the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. And he explained how mouse animal models are really deficient in a lot of ways because the brains of mice do not have the corrugated folds that the human brain has. He explained it in an article like this: the differences—the folding are differences that “may explain why many common genetic mutations responsible for severe neurological disorders in humans have little effect when bred into mice by researchers trying to study the mechanisms of human [diseases].”\n\nAnd organoids, these—they’re actually really tiny; they don’t know how to create a fully fledged brain. But having these sections of tissue can be really useful. Organoids have been used in studying a disease like Zika that was epidemic in Brazil years ago, and they were able to establish, through the organoids’ growth patterns, that the virus can lead to microcephaly, which is an infant with a small head. That might have been just a hypothesis if they didn’t have access to that tissue that they were able to grow into organoids.\n\nThe question that always comes up with this is whether these organoids are conscious, whether they’re sentient and are able to interact with the world. There are some tantalizing experiments that suggest that it might be possible to do that, but the answer to that is largely that they are not conscious entities ...\n\nFeltman: Mm.\n\nStix: In any sense. Knoblich said in the article, “The probability that a lab-grown brain will develop a mind of its own is nil. An organoid is not a ‘humanoid’ in a jar and will not be one even in the far future. Any conscious being needs to be able to process information from the senses to develop an internal mental model of reality. Organoids are neither able to see nor hear and lack any sensory [input].”\n\nFeltman: Hmm, well, speaking of the future, even if we don’t have sentient brains in a lab, which I think is probably a good thing, what are some trends you think we might see come up in the neuroscience field?\n\nStix: There have been a number of advances, like deep-brain stimulation, which are carefully placed electrodes in the brain that have been a total godsend for thousands and thousands of people with Parkinson’s disease. Moving to the future that is expanding for things like depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. There have been demonstrations of brain-machine interfaces that led an ALS [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis] patient with almost no motor capacity to voice words from the person’s thoughts.\n\nThe holy grail for neuroscience is consciousness. It’s one of the things that most intrigues readers: the idea of what actually underlies consciousness, whether in humans or machine. There have been experiments in the last couple of years testing out ideas for consciousness, and there was a well-publicized bet between the neuroscientist Christof Koch and the philosopher David Chalmers ...\n\nFeltman: Mm.\n\nStix: About whether there would be the neural correlates, the actual neural processes underlying consciousness, about now. The neuroscientist, Christof Koch, bet that there would be available to scientists an understanding of what underlies consciousness. And the consensus was that we have not reached that. That is a goal that will probably go for generations and generations before we understand that because of the complexity—what’s sometimes called the “most complex machine in the known universe”—to understand the emergent properties from a machine that has 100 trillion connections that are all interacting with each other.\n\nOne of the preoccupations of neuroscience science and medicine in general is neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. And there has been progress during the past decade—coming up with blood tests to diagnose the disease and drugs that somewhat modify the course of the disease—but this work is continuing, and there’s no drug that [approximates] anything close to a cure.\n\nI actually covered some of this—I went to Colombia to write on a clinical trial of families near Medellín, Colombia, who had dominant genes that assuredly brought on Alzheimer’s at about the age of 45. The trial was attempting to determine whether a drug that removes the amyloid proteins that build up in people with Alzheimer’s would prevent the disease. And it turned out that it didn’t, but it also marked a period when there had been progress, and there are drugs today that have been approved in the last few years that do help somewhat to delay the progression of the disease.\n\nAnd there’s also been an attempt to deal with neuropsychiatric disorders, drugs like the SSRIs for depression or lithium for bipolar disease. These drugs are really old [laughs], they are decades and decades old, and there’s a need to come up with new drugs. There, there have been some ideas, some ideas that have generated a lot of excitement, like ketamine for depression. Ketamine is considered a psychedelic, but it’s not, like, a classic psychedelic like LSD. There has been an attempt to try to use these for things like post-traumatic stress disorder. Recently there was a trial on MDMA that seemed successful, but for a number of reasons the FDA didn’t approve that drug. So all of the psychedelics show a lot of promise, but they’re not there yet. So that is still an area that’s very much in development.\n\nFeltman: Well, thank you so much for talking through your career with us. It’s been super interesting.\n\nStix: Sure.\n\nFeltman: And congratulations on your retirement.\n\nStix: Oh, thank you very much. It’s been an incredible experience to work here. Thank you for inviting me, and I thank Scientific American for letting me stay and basically be in learning mode for 35 years. So thank you.\n\nFeltman: That’s all for today’s episode.

What can the humble but recently quite expensive egg tell us about what lies ahead?\n\nRight now, prices for eggs on grocery store shelves are still very high. But that shouldn’t last much longer: The USDA-tracked average wholesale price for a dozen standard eggs has fallen from $8 as of early March to around $3 in the most recent data. (The reason for the drop is that there’s been a sharp decline in the number of chickens affected by avian flu.) This should result in falling prices at the retail level within “several weeks,” egg economists (egg-conomists, haha) say.\n\nThat means politicians, members of the press, and consumers may soon need to find a new symbol of rising costs. With 10 percent base tariffs imposed on most imported goods, and even larger duties levied on imports from the U.S.’s three largest trading partners, there should be a lot of rising costs to go around. Cars and smartphones with Canadian and Chinese supply chains could be the subject of well-publicized sticker shock; the same goes for Mexican-origin groceries like avocados, strawberries, and Modelo. A lot of generic prescription drugs are made abroad, too, and there’s no “kitchen table” issue more basic than grandma’s freakin’ pills.\n\nWhatever replaces it, the egg’s reign as the totemically expensive consumer product—mentioned even more often by politicians and ticked-off voters in recent years than the cost of a gallon of gas—was a lengthy and consequential one. The price of a carton rose by about 20 percent over the course of 2021, and bird flu caused it to more than double in 2022. That was perfect timing for Republicans, whose midterm election strategy was to blame Democrats’ COVID stimulus bill for creating “Bidenflation.” (Whether that was a fair allegation is a touchy subject even among Dems, but suffice it to say inflation, at the least, had other causes too.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next two years were a full-on Age of the Political Egg, with the dairy-aisle item receiving, per the Nexis database, mentions in something like 400 separate Fox News segments. Joe Biden, God bless him, somehow ended up bringing up the cost of eggs before Donald Trump did during their ill-fated June 2024 debate. During the Trump–Kamala Harris debate, Trump seemed to suggest—in the not-quite-right way in which he often discusses normal-people stuff—that eggs, bacon, and cereal had become unattainably expensive. (He later said he would bring down the price of groceries, somehow, with tariffs, contrasting this with Harris’ alleged plan to impose “communist price controls.”) Touring a grocery store in Reading, Pennsylvania, in September, J.D. Vance hit his usual mark—would-be humor that lands in the dead stillness of the uncanny valley—by telling onlookers that his two young sons ate a combined 14 eggs each morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats like Harris, on their heels, tried to frame the costs of eggs and other groceries as a matter of corporate profiteering—with some justification, it turns out—to little avail. When Harris lost, it was widely agreed that inflation, as represented by eggs, had been the biggest reason why. And while voters’ judgments about who was at fault may have been questionable, it’s hard to blame them for being alarmed given that, for four decades prior, these kinds of price surges and shortages were mostly unheard of. A $10 carton of eggs was something from crazy world, the kind of thing that happened in other countries. Biden had been elected to restore national stability. (To put things back together again, if you will.) In the average voter’s perception, his failure to prevent further disruptions to basic routines was evidence of a fundamental weakness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I find it interesting how press articles often covered small, locally owned, literal mom-and-pop diners that were struggling to offer the inexpensive breakfast plates for which they’re known and beloved,” said Emily Contois, a professor at the University of Tulsa who studies the relationship between food and culture. “Diners play an outsized, patriotic role on the campaign trail as they cultivate a sense of working-class authenticity. So this wasn’t just the concern that eggs were expensive and changing what we could cook and eat at home, but also how egg prices were altering these broader food rituals that tap into national identity.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring COVID, she told me, Trump went to dangerous lengths to maintain the supply of meat—an even more resonant protein—to American consumers. “I can’t help but see a corollary to how Trump thought it was so important during his first administration to keep meat fully stocked in grocery stores,” she said. “Meat symbolizes what it means to eat well for many Americans. Meatpacking is such dangerous work even under typical circumstances, let alone during a pandemic, but these workers were deemed essential because meat is essential to how many Americans conceive of themselves.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the story didn’t end with the election—because then Trump was president again, and eggs were still expensive. So just like that, Democrats loved to talk about groceries. The reason for high egg prices was still bird flu, not presidential policy—but in politics, turnabout is fair play, and Trump certainly didn’t give the impression he was making the matter a priority. In fact, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team accidentally fired members of the Department of Agriculture’s avian-flu staff in February before quickly bringing them back. (The USDA did announce a new billion-dollar bird-flu mitigation program in February.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe subject of eggs also gave Democrats an excuse to put off figuring out how to address their party’s deeper issues, or how to make swing voters care about Trump and Musk’s efforts to nullify the Constitution and create a MAGA police state. Given the choice between issuing a press release about egg prices and confronting your simultaneous unpopularity with both your traditional working-class base and your new white-collar professional base … for many Democrats, it isn’t a tough call.\n\nThe response to tariff-induced inflation will likely follow the egg’s path. The opposition party will delight in being able to tell a simple story about destructive incompetence, one that resonates even with voters who only get their news by accident from TikTok dance videos; the party in power will try to change the subject, ineffectually. And if Democrats are lucky and dogged enough, eventually they will be back in charge, and will then have the privilege of being blamed when the prices of Modelo, Advil, and the Ford Mustang don’t come down fast enough. Like a chick breaking through a shell, the cycle just keeps on repeating itself."}

As good as it is to take Xbox console save files to PC and vice versa, the app we have to use to access these features is light years behind close rivals like Steam.\n\nMicrosoft has very gradually, and very slowly made improvements to the Xbox app on PC, but often updates to the service result in a \"one step forward, one step back\" development cycle. This latest \"change\" seems to exemplify that.\n\nAs what I would describe as something of an Xbox PC app power user, I've written tons of articles critiquing and offering feedback on the Xbox app for PC. Things have improved, but one area of immense disappointment is the app's game library.\n\nThe way the Xbox app displays owned games is simply diabolical, and inexplicably, recently, it has gotten even worse. But there might be a good reason for it.\n\nThe Xbox app library system is very poor, and is now displaying unplayable content. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nI've written extensively about how much I love Xbox Play Anywhere, so imagine my disappointment when I scroll through my library, start seeing a bunch of new games, only to find they aren't playable.\n\nIndeed, now, by default, the Xbox app on PC has begun showing dozens of Xbox console games. However, the install button simply displays a \"Content failed to load\" message, greyed out and unclickable. What's worse, the Xbox app also started showing Windows Phone games as well despite the fact Windows Phone is no longer with us (RIP).\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAngry Birds and other weird mobile games I wouldn't install in a million years are now sharing a list with unplayable Xbox 360 games like Banjo-Kazooie, as well as Xbox One games I actually would like to play on my Lenovo Legion Go like Darkest Dungeon. Of course, none of them work, and you can't remove or hide them from your library either.\n\nPutting aside the fact that the Xbox app's game library still needs a TON of work, why might this be happening?\n\nEvidence of the grand Xbox singularity?\n\nXbox's ASUS partner handheld \"Kennan\" has yet to break cover. (Image credit: Windows Central | Rebecca Spear)\n\nMicrosoft's future Xbox hardware platform looks set to bridge the Xbox console and Windows gaming worlds more than ever before. Although we have yet to see the full reveal, there are hints.\n\nA recent Xbox concept art piece seemed to suggest Steam itself will get full Xbox app integration in the future, which coincides with previous comments from Xbox lead Phil Spencer that he'd like to see third-party storefronts on Xbox console hardware. Xbox is also working with ASUS on a handheld codenamed Kennan, which is its first foray into the form factor ahead of its own Microsoft-designed Xbox handheld. This is all about bringing Xbox console and Windows PC development together, where Xbox Play Anywhere is the default.\n\nIf Microsoft's Xbox and PC gaming empires are about to converge, you'd probably expect to see store library listings for Xbox console games appear on the platform. However, I doubt Microsoft intends for people to see dead mobile games like Angry Birds Windows Store edition light up alongside games they actually care about.\n\nIf I had to guess, some of this is the result of data base work designed to facilitate a future convergence between the Xbox console and Xbox PC gaming stores. It's just rather inelegantly cobbled together right now, particularly if you're someone who actively uses the Xbox app on PC.\n\nMicrosoft needs to do a ton of work to get the Xbox PC app up to par with the likes of Steam. Cloud saves, library management, big picture mode, avoiding annoying things like User Account Control pop ups, \"app permissions\" and other annoying things really, really frustrate the experience. Seeing abandonware and mobile slop appear in my library is just a bit of a mouldy cherry on top right now.\n\nEither way, I've reached out to Microsoft to comment.\n\nDo you use the Xbox app on PC? Do you use PC Game Pass? How have your experiences been? Hit the comments."}

Since entering office, Trump has demonstrated the ability to manipulate the value of any particular stock by simply announcing a tariff or exemption, putting him in a particular position of power over his yields from TMTG.\n\nTrump profits directly from TMTG in two key ways, Legum explained in his newsletter Public Notice. “First, TMTG will invest a portion of its cash reserves in accounts. Secondly, as the majority shareholder in TMTG, Trump will benefit from the fees generated by these accounts. The performance of the underlying assets held in these accounts will determine both TMTG’s return on its cash reserves and interest from outside investors,” he wrote.\n\nThrough TMTG’s actively managed investment accounts, Trump would be able to directly financially benefit simply by announcing or rescinding a policy. For example, Apple stock sank when Trump announced his sweeping “reciprocal tariff” policy on April 2 and continued to drop as he escalated tariffs on Chinese goods to the triple digits. But when the administration announced that there would be an exemption applied to electronic devices on April 11, Apple stock began to improve."}

Since January, at least 901 students across 128 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked, according to a review of data from the Associated Press.\n\nOn Wednesday, an immigration-focused law firm in Atlanta filed a lawsuit against Trump on behalf of 133 foreign students. The filing reveals some of the staggering reasons students believe they’re being targeted (the visas are often revoked without providing a specific reason), which range from expired license plates to speeding tickets. Add the violation of a fishing license to the list.\n\nOnda’s attorney is pursuing various options to keep him in the country, but the aspiring computer scientist told Deseret News he’s already “packing everything” in case he needs to leave abruptly.

Today, Minisforum—a long-time favorite in the segment—is offering a refurbished EM680 mini PC for just $279. It’s packed with 32GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a Ryzen processor.\n\nGranted, the AMD Ryzen 7 6800U within the Minisforum EM-series isn’t the newest processor on the block. But with 8 cores and 16 threads, it’s more than enough to handle basic work, browsing, and video duties, and AMD’s integrated graphics are surprisingly great for gaming. You can check out the same setup running on this breakdown of new laptops from 2022, where it puts up some very respectable frames at 1080p—and that’s with less RAM and possibly some limitations for battery.\n\nThe EM680 is a seriously mini PC, just 80mm (3.14 inches) square. That’s smaller than a lot of USB docks! The 32GB of RAM has already maxed out its capacity, but you can boost storage with a 2TB M.2 SSD if you want, or just pop in a microSD card. It’s also stacked for ports, including HDMI, double USB-C, three USB-A 3.2 ports, and a 3.5mm audio jack. This is a lot of PC for under three hundred bucks, despite its tiny footprint.\n\nMinisforum seems to be clearing out its stock, as this model is refurbished and it isn’t available in new form. But Minisforum offers a full year manufacturer warranty on refurb sales, a big improvement over some that only come with 90 days. With a price this low, it might be gone soon.\n\nGet this Minisforum mini PC stacked with 32GB RAM for $270"}

I put together websites in HTML as a teenager (which, yes, were hosted on GeoCities) and have been occasionally dabbling in Python since.\n\nYet none of my projects got very far and, apart from my early websites, I never made anything useful. My efforts all followed a familiar pattern: I’d fixate on a particular resource—like an O’Reilly book or an online course—and get started with great enthusiasm, but as I’d realize I was months or years away from creating anything remotely useful, I’d give up.\n\nI’ve used Claude AI to quickly generate a simple dice roller web app. Matt Smith / Foundry\n\nThat changed in late 2024 when my general frustration with WordPress, which I was using for my personal website, got the better of me. In a fit, I threw my website’s content plus a screenshot of it into Claude 3.5 Sonnet and asked the AI to replicate my site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To my amazement, Claude 3.5 generated a functional website. It wasn’t perfect, but after a couple hours of working with Claude, I wound up with a website I liked even better than its WordPress predecessor.\n\nMy approach was exactly what Karpathy described. I didn’t read the code, nor did I really try to understand it (though I did have to think a bit about how the featured articles carousel works). That aside, I just told Claude what to do, copy-and-pasted the results in VSCode, saved the file, and reloaded my browser to see what changed. And it worked.\n\nA work-in-progress screenshot of my Pico-8 puzzle game and the vibe-coded source. Matt Smith / Foundry\n\nBut the most important part? It was fun! Fun enough that I’ve since tried my hand at several other coding projects. I made an online tool to track initiative and roll dice when DMing tabletop roleplaying games, I made another tool to simplify rolling dice in Battletech, and I’m currently making a puzzle game for the Pico-8 virtual game console. I also used AI to guide me through setting up tools that require a bit of fussing, like OpenAI’s Whisper speech-to-text model.\n\nNotably, all three projects were in different programming languages—HTML/JavaScript, Python, and Lua—none of which I’m even remotely proficient with. I’ve also dabbled in some C#, as I started to make the puzzle game in Unity before deciding it was overbuilt for my needs and swapping to Pico-8. I also toyed with turning my tabletop RPG tool into a Windows app before deciding that wasn’t helpful."}

In my allegedly humble opinion, it just means a minimum set of specs that include recent AI-ready processors and some other good guts… along with a price tag that’s a bit on the high side. But today, you can get an Acer model for just $569.99.\n\nThe Acer Aspire 14 AI is a workhorse laptop, no flashy materials or pretensions at gaming prowess. Our reviewer Mark Knapp called it solid and reliable, if a little bland—it screams “Toyota Camry” to me—but you can’t argue with the specs. With a Core Ultra 5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage space, it should handle all the tasks a regular user will throw at it, and it has a 14-inch touchscreen on top of that. Other extras include Windows Hello face-scanning for secure logins, double USB-C and USB-A ports, and a full-sized HDMI port.\n\nAt 3.07 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s neither skinny nor chunky, and the battery life is competitive even with some recent Snapdragon models that can go for longer than a pink bunny in an old battery commercial. It would make a good practical machine for a student or anyone whose current laptop just isn’t cutting it anymore. Read the full review—of this exact model with these same specs!—for more info.\n\nAntOnline is selling this config of the Aspire 14 AI for $569.99, an impressive $230 off Acer’s current retail price. It’s marked as a “quick ship deal,” but I don’t know what that means in terms of availability, so I wouldn’t let that tab go dormant if you’ve decided to buy it.\n\nGet this Acer AI laptop with 16GB RAM for cheap: $570"}

That’s why it’s always nice to have a power bank on hand. Just in case. Especially when you’re traveling, commuting, or otherwise out for a long time.\n\nFortunately, one of our favorite solutions for that is now on sale. Anker has a compact power bank with a 10,000mAh capacity and a convenient built-in USB-C cable that really comes in handy, and this power bank is now just $16 on Amazon with Prime (was $26). If you don’t have Prime, you can still score this price by signing up for a free Prime trial.\n\nThe Anker Zolo packs enough juice to keep your phone going all day, able to fully recharge an iPhone 15 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S24 two times over. But it’s that built-in USB-C cable that’s the real hero, allowing you to take it anywhere without also worrying about the charging cable. When not in use, the built-in cable loops back and locks into place, serving as a handle strap for carrying the power bank around.\n\nOn top of that, the Anker Zolo also features a separate USB-C port as well as a USB-A port, so you can charge up to three devices at once. With 30W of power output, it offers fast charging to get your phone ready in minutes, not hours. (Just be aware that the total charging speed gets split up if you’re using multiple ports at the same time.)\n\nWant more capacity? The 20,000mAh Anker Zolo is on sale for $29. They’re both about the size of a credit card, but the bigger capacity makes it a little heavier. If portability is your main concern, get the smaller Anker Zolo for $16 while you can! This deal won’t last forever.\n\nSave 38% on this power bank with built-in USB-C cable"}

While its … [+3485 chars]", "title": "How creativity became the reigning value of our time", "fullContent": "Given how much we obsess over it, the concept of creativity can feel like something that has always existed, a thing philosophers and artists have pondered and debated throughout the ages. While it’s a reasonable assumption, it’s one that turns out to be very wrong. As Samuel Franklin explains in his recent book, The Cult of Creativity, the first known written use of creativity didn’t actually occur until 1875, “making it an infant as far as words go.” What’s more, he writes, before about 1950, “there were approximately zero articles, books, essays, treatises, odes, classes, encyclopedia entries, or anything of the sort dealing explicitly with the subject of ‘creativity.’”\n\nThis raises some obvious questions. How exactly did we go from never talking about creativity to always talking about it? What, if anything, distinguishes creativity from other, older words, like ingenuity, cleverness, imagination, and artistry? Maybe most important: How did everyone from kindergarten teachers to mayors, CEOs, designers, engineers, activists, and starving artists come to believe that creativity isn’t just good—personally, socially, economically—but the answer to all life’s problems?\n\nThankfully, Franklin offers some potential answers in his book. A historian and design researcher at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, he argues that the concept of creativity as we now know it emerged during the post–World War II era in America as a kind of cultural salve—a way to ease the tensions and anxieties caused by increasing conformity, bureaucracy, and suburbanization.\n\n“Typically defined as a kind of trait or process vaguely associated with artists and geniuses but theoretically possessed by anyone and applicable to any field, [creativity] provided a way to unleash individualism within order,” he writes, “and revive the spirit of the lone inventor within the maze of the modern corporation.”\n\nBrainstorming, a new method for encouraging creative thinking, swept corporate America in the 1950s. A response to pressure for new products and new ways of marketing them, as well as a panic over conformity, it inspired passionate debate about whether true creativity should be an individual affair or could be systematized for corporate use. INSTITUTE OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY/THE MONACELLI PRESS\n\nI spoke to Franklin about why we continue to be so fascinated by creativity, how Silicon Valley became the supposed epicenter of it, and what role, if any, technologies like AI might have in reshaping our relationship with it.\n\nI’m curious what your personal relationship to creativity was growing up. What made you want to write a book about it?\n\nLike a lot of kids, I grew up thinking that creativity was this inherently good thing. For me—and I imagine for a lot of other people who, like me, weren’t particularly athletic or good at math and science—being creative meant you at least had some future in this world, even if it wasn’t clear what that future would entail. By the time I got into college and beyond, the conventional wisdom among the TED Talk register of thinkers—people like Daniel Pink and Richard Florida—was that creativity was actually the most important trait to have for the future. Basically, the creative people were going to inherit the Earth, and society desperately needed them if we were going to solve all of these compounding problems in the world.\n\nOn the one hand, as someone who liked to think of himself as creative, it was hard not to be flattered by this. On the other hand, it all seemed overhyped to me. What was being sold as the triumph of the creative class wasn’t actually resulting in a more inclusive or creative world order. What’s more, some of the values embedded in what I call the cult of creativity seemed increasingly problematic—specifically, the focus on self-­realization, doing what you love, and following your passion. Don’t get me wrong—it’s a beautiful vision, and I saw it work out for some people. But I also started to feel like it was just a cover for what was, economically speaking, a pretty bad turn of events for many people."}

Our conversation covers his transition from academic publishing to public writing, the challenges facing higher education, and how colleges can better integrate with their communities through thoughtful urban design.\n\nKey points:\n\nThe PhD trap: \"We probably got to start telling people don't go do PhDs\" — the job market has collapsed while universities keep churning out graduates destined for precarious employment.\n\nUniversities as urban saviors: Colleges preserved walkable \"pre-war\" neighborhoods that would have been bulldozed for suburban sprawl elsewhere.\n\nEveryone loves universities except their neighbors: The persistent \"town and gown\" conflict sees locals fighting against student housing despite choosing to live near campuses.\n\nThe common enemy isn't people—it's stagnation: Rather than fighting \"NIMBYs,\" urbanists should unite against \"freezing towns in amber and endless sprawl.\"\n\nDisney's $130 urbanism irony: Disneyland charges visitors to experience the walkable main streets that once existed naturally in every American town before suburban development destroyed them.\n\nIntroduction & Background\n\nDave Deek: Hi Ryan, how are you doing?\n\nRyan Allen: Dave, doing well. Doing all right. It's not quite a sunny day here in Southern California, so I think I've been lied to with that PR campaign.\n\nDave Deek: At least it's not Houston where the weather just kind of been bipolar like it's hot and what you imagine Houston to be then it's suddenly cold and rainy and then go back to hot.\n\nRyan Allen: Sure. Yeah. I know we Southern Californians shouldn't complain, but we certainly do a lot.\n\nDave Deek: All right. But before we dive in, could you share what led you to write College Towns and what's your personal connection to both higher education and urbanism and YIMBYism?\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah, sure. I mean, the short story is I received tenure over the summer and I always said once I did get tenure, I was going to try to put more... I'm a professor. I guess I should say that I'm a professor at Soka University of America here in Southern California. I teach international education. And I've always thought that academic publishing is just not very fast. I just had an article that came out a couple days ago that literally it's five years in the making and it just gets bogged down with—I mean peer review is good, but other ways around the sort of the journal system isn't good. The book publishing can be very slow in academic presses.\n\nSo I just told myself if I get tenure, I'm gonna start kind of putting myself more out there, writing quickly because it's really hard to get things out there quickly in academia. So I was like, \"All right, I can kind of do this myself.\" So that's kind of the quick story.\n\nI think the longer story is I've always had kind of this passion for public intellectuals or sort of public writing. I mean, I thought maybe at one time I would be a journalist. I had a fork in the road moment of going to a PhD or going to be sort of a journalist with a publication in China. I decided to go do my PhD and even my undergrad background was PR communications which is not really in my area now but it's kind of helped me think about writing and presenting myself.\n\nAnd then even when I told myself I was going to start College Towns I was hesitant. I think I started in October and I received tenure kind of over the summer. So it's a few months of me just kind of thinking should I really do this? Should I try to write op-eds in popular publications? And I did that. I started kind of trying to publish op-eds in newspapers, magazines, whatever it was and I had two rejections right in a row and I was just kind of annoyed. I was like, \"Man, two different rejections, two different articles, two things I wanted to get out there\" and it was one of those things like you write it and then as time goes on it can't really be published again. This is kind of a waste of time.\n\nI'm going to keep putting in all this effort and then the things don't get published. So I said, what, I'm just going to start this urbanism and sort of education together. And I love the idea of college towns. I'm passionate about higher ed, but just the college itself. I mean, that's where I wanted to work. My first job out of undergrad, I was a leadership consultant for my fraternity's headquarters. I would travel across the country going to different college campuses sort of helping the chapters or sometimes they would get in trouble because 20-year-old dudes do a lot of dumb stuff. So I got to see these campuses across the country and really was just an amazing experience and so I kind of chased that professionally.\n\nAnd so I have an academic background in higher ed, but in terms of that urbanism, that's always kind of been a part of my life, sort of personally rather than professionally. Studying abroad in Italy kind of inspired me to think more along those things. And on Twitter actually is where I really started getting big into these kind of movements, connecting with Strong Towns. I end up writing for them a little bit, at least one article. And so I said, \"This is actually much more interesting and important. People are caring about this than my other academic areas.\" And so I'm welding them together now in College Towns.\n\nAnd so I'm writing a book and putting some work from the book there and connecting sort of aspects of town and gown and these types of things and it's been a lot of fun.\n\nFaculty Working Conditions & PhD Education\n\nDave Deek: That sounds a lot of fun and I really do appreciate when professors decide to write directly more often. I've been reading and summarizing a whole lot of academic papers and besides the fact they're academic papers, there's actually a few good ones and a few of the professors who write them, the research students that write them, they just stick with publishing out papers. They don't have to elaborate, explain their thought process why they decide to research more often than not. And I really do appreciate when professors decide to write more, but I need to make sure that I don't get us off topic.\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah, sorry if I went a little derailed there.\n\nDave Deek: No. No. You can get derailed. You're the one being interviewed. I should be the one that should stick to the topic.\n\nRyan Allen: Okay, fair enough.\n\nDave Deek: So, let's get to a number of your articles. When you covered that homeless professor I believe his name was Dr. Daniel McKeown and the school was UCLA, is that correct?\n\nRyan Allen: That's right. Yeah.\n\nDave Deek: What do you think about these? We're seeing more and more stories especially now with the Trump administration about faculty working conditions not just declining from the universities taking advantage of the faculty labor market but also because the Trump administration is putting the pressure on academia, especially what academics could say speech-wise, and what are your solutions to this growing problem, if there are solutions?\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah. I mean, that interview even happened before Trump was elected so I hesitate to blame everything on Trump or even most of the things that are happening in our sector. It's sort of a long tale of 40 years of changes in higher education.\n\nAnd in his case in particular, he had kind of been dangled—you go into a PhD program and often times they're training you for academia on the other side. That's what our programs are often training for, but the reality is there's just not as many jobs as they're allowing into these PhD programs.\n\nAnd what ends up happening, a lot of people just go and they leave and that's fine. They're like, \"Great, I got some skills, I got a PhD and now I'm happy in another sector\" and we actually call that alt-academia even though that's what a lot of people are going to do, to be honest, more so than in actual academia. But he was one of these guys that sort of loved teaching and really saw himself as a professor. And so he got kind of—I don't want to say trapped but sort of funneled into what I call \"adjunctification,\" although he kind of pushed back when I called it that. But essentially precarious jobs that don't pay much. From the outside it might seem really cool—\"I'm a professor at UCLA\" but what does that mean?\n\nIt's like, okay, I'm teaching 150 students per class and I am making 60 grand a year or whatever it was, maybe less in some cases. And there's just so many jobs like that. He's in some ways lucky. Sometimes you might get a job that's just giving you one class. So it's four grand for the semester. That's just like a basic adjunct job. He actually was a lecturer, sort of technically a full-time position, but it's this kind of package of positions that universities are doing due to budget cuts due to kind of just not—when they invest in a faculty who's going to be tenured, that's a huge commitment because we're there for 20, 30, whatever even longer years.\n\nSo I always tell people—like you said, how can we fix this problem?—we probably got to start telling people don't go do PhDs. Like I'm sorry, it might be your passion but the careers just aren't there. It's six or more years of your life where you're basically not really working. So I always hesitate to tell my students \"you got to know what's on the other side for this.\" It's not just \"okay I am going to this position and they're going to be paying me.\" Now they have PhDs that don't even fund and you pay them for six years of your time. And this is just not a development that I think a lot of people are ready for and then once they get into it, it's sort of like they feel like \"I've already invested this much into it, now I can't quit now.\" And so you just sort of get funneled into these positions.\n\nSo I always tell people don't go do a PhD. Of course some people want to do it and that's fine. But we have to make it clear what's going to happen on the other side. How to fix that? I mean that's like a broader argument about fixing higher ed and properly funding higher education, going back to some kind of teaching focused, putting respect on people who are teachers. I don't think it's happening anytime soon because the direction that we're going is the opposite with some of the things that are happening with the Trump administration where they're cutting X, Y, and Z and we're in a big battle now.\n\nSo it's like the sector already had its issues. We have this new problem that I honestly don't really... I mean maybe you're going to ask me but I'm not quite sure how to exactly grapple with it. But at least right now I think telling people not to go to PhDs unless they have either independently wealthy or they don't really care if they're not going to be an academic and maybe they're an international student they just want to stay in the country... although again there's issues with that now. So that's kind of my take on my own field.\n\nUS vs. China Higher Education Landscape\n\nDave Deek: That's very—how do I say here?—not very fun to think about, especially considering I believe you written an article about Deep Seek's AI team and their education backgrounds and challenging assumptions about universities overseas especially Chinese universities. With this in mind, with basically the decay of the American PhD, the American degree altogether, how do you see the landscape of higher education shifting especially between the US and China?\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah, I mean I guess in two ways. So the Deep Seek thing was interesting because I think a lot of people when they saw Deep Seek, there's an assumption that those students were trained in the United States and they went back and we lost them due to brain drain. And what I found is that wasn't true. They had pretty much but almost all of them had been trained from undergrad to their PhDs, although not all of them had PhDs, in Chinese universities. And so that's like \"Wow. Okay, they don't need us anymore. They don't need our expertise.\"\n\nThe second aspect of that was even I went back and looked at their professors that they had listed and even those professors for the most part had been trained in China. So now we're two generations out of this really advanced research that's happening in Chinese universities—you're right that they don't need the United States.\n\nI will clarify I think sometimes when I talk about this I'm talking about PhDs broadly and there really is a difference between STEM, where you're in a lab or where you're doing some sort of technical work, versus maybe the humanities or the social sciences. The humanities and social science—it can be done but it's difficult to translate that into work, whereas the technical ones—I mean you saw that some of those students in that article they were bridging pretty easily into companies like Deep Seek or even others like Nvidia. There were people who connected to that because they have those technical skills and they are wanted in these other sectors. So the STEM sector is a little bit different in terms of the PhD.\n\nBut again you can learn some of those skills without a PhD. You can get technical training or even just a masters, and some of those STEM skills are enough for undergrads or people drop out. I mean that's the big thing—like you go to Stanford and you drop out. I think I saw a meme or even social media viral post this week where it was like \"you go to Stanford and you drop out the first day because you meet people to start your AI company.\" Now again that's not everybody but it is kind of funny to think about. There is a difference between these kind of STEM fields.\n\nWhat I'll say is that I think the US sector can and still is strong. We keep hurting ourselves in terms of the decisions that are happening right now. But up until two months ago, we still attracted students from around the world. Even if Chinese universities were getting better, we're still getting some Chinese students. Obviously, we were getting a ton of Indian students. Indian students in the past couple years had surpassed Chinese students. So, that was really our competitive advantage—like we're recruiting these people. They're the best minds and we're able to keep them. Right now, I am questioning that kind of future as we move forward just simply because of the stuff with the Trump administration and international students.\n\nDave Deek: All right. So one last purely higher education question before we move on to more about urbanism and YIMBYism. I just have to ask this question because I remember in the past right before the 1990s even the 2000s, the United States and a bunch of Western European universities were a bit more practical. I mean the Dutch used to have their entire agricultural industrial policy, the best way I could call it, revolving around Wageningen University.\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah, I mean—\n\nDave Deek: What do you think caused that change from practicality to academic publishing and do you think that might be one of the causes towards the decline of the American PhD or American higher education which was strong, which is strongish, but led to that decline?\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah, a couple things. First, the German, Dutch, some of the continental European systems are a little more practical. They have a kind of—I guess I can call it sort of like an academic type of practitioner kind of mentorship programs that are a little bit different than the American university and maybe the Anglo university. So they've always been a little more practical than our system. So that wouldn't be a surprise and I still believe they are that way with their technical track that isn't necessarily academic, although it's sort of welded to an academic system different than what we would consider kind of vocational ed in the United States. But I will say I'm not an expert on European higher education.\n\nThe second part of that and talking about our own is that I guess I would push back on the notion that the American system was more practical. I think it was actually less practical, and the problem is that we overproduced PhDs. So now there's all these programs and universities that are producing PhDs. There's just not enough spots. And so part of that is competition. So you have to now produce more papers for a PhD to get a graduate, to get a job—now they basically have to be as good as someone that was tenurable 20 years ago. And so it's just a nature of so many people trying to go into the market.\n\nWe're also chasing incentives of like you said papers which sometimes those don't necessarily help you or sorry maybe those don't have actual important information in them. It's just sort of like \"okay I'm getting this out into the world because I need something checked off on my CV.\" That's not every academic paper but that's one of my critiques of the academic publishing space.\n\nI'll also say I think in some ways chasing practicality has been a modern obsession with American universities. And when we were 40 years ago or even let's say when the GIs came out of World War II, we had the GI Bill, we really expanded higher education, the boomers came along—we weren't necessarily talking about job readiness per se or not in the same way we were. It was sort of universities had more of that liberal arts sense. The Soviet model was looking at work forces and this type of thing. Their universities were more focused on that. We were more focused on getting people in, having them think critically, have them just sort of a place to stay for a couple years, find themselves, understand, and then go out into the world. And I think that's when our universities at our best is when we're doing that.\n\nIt's when people can really find their passion, when they're not being sort of funneled into a thing because it's for work. The problem is the way that we now fund students or students have to fund themselves, then it starts breaking down into, \"I'm getting saddled with $100,000 in debt just to go think for a couple years. It's no longer worth it.\" And so then we have to sort of say, \"All right, what job do they get? If I'm going into debt 100K, I need a job on the other end.\"\n\nAnd so that's where the real problem is coming from. Where I think if we can sort of get away from that debt, it would be better if we go back to that kind of more liberal arts model where it's not about the job, it's about just thinking for four years.\n\nDave Deek: Okay, that sounds very familiar with the argument I read. I think it was W. Edwards Deming, I believe the industrial engineer who was arguing actually a lot of the same points you are, I believe in his book \"The New Economics,\" and he was arguing that education should be more about learning critical thinking stuff like that here because systems are going to change, systems going to adapt, etc., etc., right? But I need to make sure I get back on topic here.\n\nCollege-Community Relationships & Urbanism\n\nDave Deek: Let's—that brings up another thought in my head. How do you see the ideal relationship between a college and its surrounding community? What examples have you found that demonstrate healthy integration especially on more of an urbanist vibe?\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah, I mean that's really like my love of college is the college town. And so one thing that I really appreciate—and I'll probably have an article about this soon—is that in the United States system for colleges, we have colleges in the middle of Manhattan, like Columbia where I went, or in the middle of nowhere—I don't know, let's just throw out Stillwater, Oklahoma. And they're dotting the country to suburban.\n\nAnd it's really one of the true kind of national egalitarian systems where we don't—now a lot of the old universities are sort of centered on the east coast but there's great universities in Georgia, there's great universities in Texas, there's great universities really in every single state and that was a purposeful investment by the American government in terms of land grant universities and private institutions like churches and things like that that establish these places.\n\nAnd you see in a lot of towns and cities even that a university was built—and we're talking 100 years ago or more—and then slowly kind of incrementally everything around the university starts to build up because it's not just the students who are attracted to that space. It's sort of businesses. It's regular people. It's nice to live next to a university.\n\nAnd so a lot of the best urbanism that we can see in some of the small towns too come from university towns or areas around a university because they sort of act as a natural city because a lot of students are living right on campus. They often don't have a car and so they've been able to preserve some of those pre-war structures that often got knocked down when suburban development became the dominant way that the United States was kind of building. But around the university because they sort of kept—because there was always students there, because you couldn't really sprawl students out (you can but it's a little bit more difficult or a little more complicated than with single families)—it kept those structures around campus.\n\nAnd so, my love for this is everywhere I go, I find places that keep that old world charm or that pre-World War II charm simply by the nature of what a university is. It's essentially a small city and everything around the city is operating within that. There's obviously problems we can get into but that's kind of my rosy picture of universities and how they act as a development model essentially.\n\nHousing Struggles and Solutions\n\nDave Deek: Speaking about rosy pictures, you documented a lot of the housing struggles from multiple angles, from the homeless professor that you interviewed to the student housing shortages. It seems to me that a lot of the businesses and a lot of the people that move into the college towns full-time and right are often the same kind of people arguing to restrict student housing, especially the whole \"people pollution\" thing.\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah, you're just making me laugh, but yes.\n\nDave Deek: I mean, I was about to ask you how do you view the irony and what solutions appear most promising to you?\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah. I mean it's tough because I often ask this question—why do you live next to a university if you hate universities and students? I don't understand. And let me be clear, it's not everybody, but I think we see this in the urbanism space where there's a subset group that is loud and that has time to go down to the city council. I think most people are just trying to live their lives. They don't really care if the university does X, Y, and Z. They enjoy living there.\n\nAnd so I wouldn't categorize it as literally every single person living next to the university. That being said, we see this dynamic happen pretty much in every college town. There's even a term for it, \"town and gown.\" I almost called the substack \"Town and Gown,\" but I decided to go with \"College Town\" because it just sounded like a better name.\n\nAnyways, this town and gown dynamic is often—okay, the university has some kind of dispute with the locals. And I'll say, I used to live in a pretty traditional college town in Orange, California, right next to my university. And I would see 20-year-olds, like I said, do stupid stuff. And they would run down the street at 2 in the morning screaming, chugging a beer or whatever. I saw that. And my neighbors, who are fine with the university, fine with anything that's happening, they would get angry. They would come to me and say, \"Hey, Professor Allen, what's going on?\" and I would have to send them over to—there's always a university kind of relations person making sure students aren't doing these types of things.\n\nI think one of the problems—and trying to convey this to the town is difficult—but I think one of the solutions is building more on-campus housing. And often campus housing gets fought because the locals say it's going to be too tall. I always see that it's \"too tall of a building\" and you look around and it's like, \"okay there's another building right across the street that's basically the same height.\"\n\n\"There's going to be too much traffic if these students live here.\" It's like the students can literally walk. We don't actually need much parking. But of course then you say that, and they say \"okay now we got to build more parking because it's going to create more problems.\" And it's always these kinds of excuses.\n\nBut I think if we can build more campus housing, that stops students from living out in the houses that would be rented by people that aren't related to the university. And so that can help with rents and cost of housing that are outside of the campus space. It's just that we have to convince the locals that this is going to be better for them. And that is really difficult.\n\nAnd if we can't convince them, in most cases, to be quite honest, we should just go ahead and build it if we have the right and figure out the consequences later. I know it's better, you want to have a good neighbor. But sometimes it just becomes unreasonable.\n\nI covered this case in Lubbock, Texas, and Texas Tech, and literally the university had a stroad in front of it. Lubbock doesn't have the best urbanism and Texas Tech doesn't either. I sort of feel bad for the college. But anyways, they were trying to build this kind of campus housing right across the stroad from the entrance of the university and everyone was getting upset. The university apparently is going to go through with it. But the point being is that the problem isn't the kids. The problem is the road that's in between the university and these housings. It's a high-speed stroad. But I mean, it looks like a highway drag strip and it's literally between a neighborhood and the university. It doesn't make any sense to me. And we sort of have to convey that and talk about those things, I think.\n\nDave Deek: Yeah, that does not sound like a good idea, especially the fact that students tend to do weird stuff, but housing still needs to be built. So, I guess it balances out in that weird way.\n\nRyan Allen: Right. Yes.\n\nDave Deek: Besides talking about weird ways, I think I remember reading an article of yours that was talking about that students can handle smaller or weirder spaces, I think especially office hours and conversions. Could you talk more about that and how might colleges leverage that?\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah. This is something that I've gotten a lot of push back on. I always say that in urbanism we have all these regulations in land use and there's lot size minimums, room size, windows, there's all these type of restrictions and the idea is that we don't want to send somebody to live in a slum. That's the argument. Okay. And I get that. I understand that.\n\nBut our pendulum has swung too far and the American kind of conception of what a home has swung too big and so we're cutting out a lot of smaller housing units like the SRO (single room occupancy) which was a huge part of our cities 70 years ago, even more years ago. Young people or people moving to the city just trying to make their way, maybe some people who are trying to get back on their feet—we've essentially cut those out of our cities. We've either made them illegal and then when they shut down or they convert to hotels, this option doesn't exist anymore.\n\nSo what that does is without these kind of tinier spaces, it sends people to have roommates, to have somebody sleeping on the couch. That's what happens in these college towns—the students get crammed into a single family home in a neighborhood and they'll put two guys in one room and one guy's living on the couch or in the garage or something weird. Why? Because there's not these sort of tiny spaces that we used to have and that they're still around, especially if they're kind of grandfathered in. And students are happy to live there. They do all the time.\n\nUniversity dorms are exactly that. You have a little tiny room. Maybe you share it with somebody. You have a shared bathroom outside. And students don't mind living in the dorms. In fact, you can see it in the conversations with students. They would rather have a very tiny room that's their own space that they don't share with somebody, where they have their bed and their TV and their clothes and maybe a shared kitchen or whatever. They would rather have that than sleeping in a bigger room with somebody else in the same room. But due to some rules, we can't build these types of things. And it's cut out of an option.\n\nI used to live in one in South Korea. Very tiny space. I mean, we're talking about less than 200 square feet or something like that. It was basically just a bed and I had a shower in mine which is kind of interesting—my bed bucked up against the shower and I really just lived there for a semester before I was able to move to a normal apartment with a couple dudes. And so that's the kind of thing that I think we need to start rethinking.\n\nAnd again, I did mention I think in Boston, Mayor Wu has added universities into office conversion. And because offices are sort of often weird spaces with—windows might be an issue, of course it should be safe—but creating some kind of triangular room where the window is here and you have this weird space in the back. Students don't care. They're not a family. They're not going to live there permanently. They're going to live there for a year, semester, couple years, whatever, and then they're going to move out, but they need sort of this transition type space and office conversions can be—they're already a challenge. So, let's try this for students.\n\nSo that's something that really a lot of people push back on and they say—I've had people say \"I like all of your writing except when you say that because I don't want people to go to slums\" and they think that we're going to send all the poor people into these types of terrible housing situations like they see these pictures of Hong Kong or something. And I don't think that's what's going to happen and I would rather have people in smaller homes or tiny rooms rather than living on the street, rather than living in their car, rather than having to sleep on the couch or whatever. I would rather have that, and those are the options that we're facing right now.\n\nDave Deek: But I'm shocked that you get a lot of push back for this because we have two models of that in the past. We had these old YMCA building places which have small rooms just to give young men a place to stay on their own. It's even in the song YMCA...\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah. Right.\n\nDave Deek: And then the second modern example is where storefronts are being converted into net cafes in Japan. And while there's a lot of moralizing about it, these net cafes again you have private rooms with sleepable couches in there. It helps young people at least have a place to stay and deals with the law and helps a lot of lower income or young people as you said who just want their own space. And for you to get push back to me is just absurd.\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah, I mean it is absurd. Even modern dorms—UCLA was trying to build a dorm on their campus and the dimensions were basically the same as the current dorms on campus and there was a lot of complaint, protest, and sort of basically the argument was \"this is too small, it's inhumane for students.\" And how can it be inhumane when the dorms that they're already living in are that size and they're popular and people want to live there?\n\nIt is absurd. And for me, I mean, not everybody who's commenting on my articles, they're probably more sympathetic, but I do think there is a lot of obstructionism simply hiding in concern for students and those types of things, and they just would rather not have any building at all and they would want fewer students. I think in most of the arguments, especially in the real policy space, again, not necessarily my readers or people I engage with on Twitter, but those are often obstructionist when you talk about the real world that's out there.\n\nTom & Jerry's Backgrounds and Media\n\nBeach City From Steven Universe & Island Town From Bee And PuppyCat\n\nDave Deek: And before we start talking about obstruction of the real world stuff, I want—let's talk a little bit about more fiction, because I can't believe there's someone else besides me who appreciates Tom and Jerry's backgrounds. Those are awesome. Especially a lot of older Hanna-Barbera and a lot of the older American cartoon backgrounds. My gosh. Why did we ever get rid of those?\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah, I mean I saw that—it wasn't mine. I did write about it, but I saw it on Twitter. It has a vibe. It's making me want to go back and watch a bunch of old cartoons. I was thinking about going back and watching some of the old Speedy Gonzalez and see how they portrayed the American Southwest. I think that that could be really interesting. So, yeah, that might be like a future project, but if anyone's listening or reading, definitely go watch that.\n\nIt's very moody and it reminds me—we often hear this conversation about American animation and Pixar was awesome. It was cool back in the day in the 90s and the early 2000s, but now it's kind of dominated the way that we do our cartoons and drawings and animation, and things have gotten very ugly. Everything looks like either a second rate Toy Story or Rick and Morty. And there's not as much kind of beautiful animation like you might see in Japan or from our own history, Tom and Jerry or whatever that might be.\n\nDave Deek: But I would push back about that. I believe I haven't watched the show itself, but I saw some background images from shows I think it's called Steven Universe and Bee and Puppy Cat. I believe that's what they're called, these gorgeous backgrounds with these beach towns and stuff like that.\n\nRyan Allen: Interesting. I don't see that. That maybe is my own bias or bubble. I need to go and look at that. I don't really engage with that media, I guess. Fair.\n\nShare\n\nUrbanism Movements and Divisions\n\nDave Deek: And so let's go talk about the real world and the ugliness stuff like that here. One of the things I've been noticing a lot here is that a lot of urban groups, a lot of these transit guys, they're constantly starting to infight more and more and more and more and more. And a lot of the YIMBY guys, not all of them, I'm a YIMBY myself, but a lot of these YIMBY guys are picking fights against—from what I see—are other groups that might be more sympathetic to urbanism. Do you have any thoughts on that matter? And bear in mind if you're uncomfortable talking about this or you just want to talk about this but want it cut out, those are both options.\n\nRyan Allen: No, I don't mind. I can see it certainly myself. I am in a fight—and I'll write an article on this—with fellow urbanists who I really like and they're doing great stuff over self-driving cars. I'm an advocate of self-driving cars. I think it's going to end up being great for society. But I understand the reservations and I've gotten into some debates with fellow urbanists and again I'll write some articles on that in the future.\n\nSo I recognize that when we say \"urbanist\" we don't even have a good word for it—whatever I just say sort of like \"the movement\" because there really isn't like one thing that unites everybody. There are kind of a set of principles or sort of loose—we understand that what we're doing now is bad but maybe we don't all agree on the same direction.\n\nMy biggest fear is that this movement of building housing, transit, things like that gets stuck on either side of the culture war—basically every other issue that we have in the United States. And right now it actually doesn't track onto the culture war. There are right NIMBYs, there are left NIMBYs, there are left YIMBYs, there are right YIMBYs. And so that I think is great because we can sort of pull from this broad political spectrum. Although on the other side there's sort of a unified push back against building housing, things like that.\n\nI think for me when I talk about these things I often point back to Strong Towns, I'm a big Strong Towns guy and maybe I don't agree with 100% of everything that they do—Chuck Marohn kind of talks about. In fact, I think they're not mostly in favor of self-driving cars, although I have a goal of trying to convince Chuck one of these days. But the point being is like they are this smaller organization that have these national grassroot movements. They kind of reject the label YIMBY even though Chuck, the founder of this organization, would say, \"Okay, 90% of the stuff we agree with, maybe 95, but here's kind of the fringes where we don't.\" And that does bring up a lot of arguments and debates.\n\nAnd I remember a few months ago or maybe last year I saw Strong Towns' Chuck Marohn arguing with sort of some YIMBYs who I really like. I think Nolan Gray and a couple other people and I was like this is like my two dads arguing or whatever, something like that—mom and dad arguing—because I really respect both of the movements broadly even if we do have those disagreements. But I think trying not to simply fall back into the labels—and that's what Strong Towns does—is helpful to gain people who might be distrustful of whether this is kind of left or right and just saying no, this is Strong Towns. These are some basic principles. So I do appreciate that and I think it could be helpful to follow their lead there.\n\nDave Deek: Yeah. But we at the end of the day, we all have the same common enemy that whether we're urbanists or YIMBY or whatever we call ourselves, and that's the NIMBYs. Especially it seems to me that NIMBYs of all colors, they just—as if they snap fingers—they unite, they attack, they seem instinctively willing to organize more. And what the only commonality that I see from the NIMBYs is demographics which always tends to be upper income, more so older folks, but some younger folks who just want to make impact—good or bad—seems to be a good chunk of them part of the NIMBY movement. And it's weird because you have these groups sometimes even headed by former investment bankers, executives, or whatnot here walking side by side with young leftists or these weird conservatives.\n\nRyan Allen: It's—I mean when you say we all have the common enemy, again Strong Towns tries to push back on that and tries to say OK and try to understand why don't these people want it and how to make an argument. Now sometimes I think OK you can make the argument, you could be rational, and they're still not going to take it, and Strong Towns I think would say all right then figure out how to do it or whatnot. But yeah, I mean I think rather than saying the enemy is NIMBYs, I think the enemy is freezing our towns in amber and endless sprawl.\n\nI think sort of—what I would say the movement, most people would agree with those two things whether it's Strong Towns, broader YIMBYs—freezing in amber and endless sprawl, those two things to me are the biggest issue. And if we can rein in some of those things in the United States, like a lot of the problems—it doesn't solve everything—I think that's another issue too is people will point to YIMBYs or even just like public transportation or sort of urbanists and say, \"You can't solve this. If we do this, it doesn't solve that.\" And it's like, if we said that with literally everything, we would do nothing. Not everything has to be solved by this one project or not everything has to be solved by adding a bus lane or whatever. Sure, we're gonna have other problems, but we can't put everything on these. Again, it goes back to the obstructionist. It's just throwing as many things at the solution to stop it from happening.\n\nDave Deek: Okay, that's a very good definition of NIMBYism—basically freezing our towns and promoting endless sprawl. And I think that might be a good rallying point for the groups, which I hope so, but I don't know if they're ever going to agree upon even that.\n\nAnd this second thing here—I know I agree with you that YIMBYism reform or whatever is not going to be the one-stop shop to fix all our problems. But at the same time, I keep seeing especially among the abundance people sort of treating it like that when reality is that a lot of towns—even though it's not going to solve all their problems or most of their problems or even 10% of their problems—implementing some reforms like ADU reform or loosening up the zoning enables greater and greater paths forward to resolve their other issues.\n\nRyan Allen: I mean, I think that's one of the problems here is—maybe it's cliché, like we're this massive country and we're really diverse, but it's certainly true in terms of the sort of YIMBY or let's just call it urbanism or whatever we're talking about here. They're very different needs.\n\nAnd I think one of them is—and again I'll probably write about this—I have a word document on my computer with 200 article ideas and I only publish once a week, and new ones come every week, but one of them is talking about how YIMBYism from New York and San Francisco often cloud the national conversation. And so I think that happens sometimes where it's like, \"What do we need in California? What do we need in New York\" is very different than potentially what they are going to need in—again I always go back to my hometown or my home state—like Tulsa, Oklahoma. Those are different things in the rust belt where maybe they have good bones but they have abandoned—those principles. Two very, very different places and needs.\n\nAnd I think the movement is big enough for both of us. It's just sometimes the arguments get kind of centered on New York or congested pricing and San Francisco or whatever's happening there and the rest of the country just kind of is forgotten. Again that's why I go to Strong Towns because it's in Brainerd, Minnesota and they often are looking at small towns in this space. And for me with college towns—and them by name are often small places, not as big places—but they're often doing really interesting stuff that we can take lessons from that might be broader applied than what's happening in maybe New York or San Francisco.\n\nDisney, Miyazaki, and Urban Design\n\nDave Deek: And just to wrap up, I'm going to ask two questions because I would love to go more into detail about that. Maybe hopefully if you're interested, you come back for a future interview to talk more about this stuff. But the last two questions here: what do you think of the Walt Disney—I would even just say Walt Disney here because his brother is also responsible for trying to promote urbanism in his own sense like the Disney brothers urbanism, EPCOT and stuff like that here. And the second thing here, we've seen—not a de facto, that's the wrong word—we don't see guys like Miyazaki talk about urbanism but you could see the sheer amount of urbanism through his work and through his art and what does it mean for a living, breathing town. What are your thoughts on both those?\n\nRyan Allen: Yeah, I also have a Disney article on the docket that I don't know when it'll come out. I live very close to Disneyland here in Southern California. In fact, I used to live so close where I'd hear the fireworks every single night—a little bit further now.\n\nBut what's funny is that Disneyland has that kind of main street, that classic idea of what a city is. And Disney himself was inspired by his hometown and his wife's hometown—sort of these ideas of an idyllic version of a city or a town that was no longer existing. The post-war America was—even before post-war, they had started kind of ripping up, defunding these street car lines and gearing up for the automobile. So that was kind of already happening even though we sort of broadly label it post-war.\n\nAnd so what's funny is he built this idyllic town, but the problem is it costs $120, $130, whatever it costs now—it just keeps going up—to go in and walk down this town. And that feeling used to be in every town across the country, that little area where it was safe to walk, where kids could run around, where there were small businesses, where there were little trinkets, where there was sort of civic pride.\n\nAnd he tried to sort of create a Disneyfied version of that. But that used to exist everywhere, including the town that it is in, used to have this really nice little main street area and you can go back and look at old photos. I've done a tweet storm about it. And it had this great little downtown. What did they do? They knocked down the housing. Some of it was racial animus actually to Hispanics who were living in the area. Some of it was just related to California's appetite for sprawl. And so now when you go to that area, it's just these department stores. There's no urbanism. There's one maybe house that doesn't have setbacks. Everything else is really wide and it's a really unpleasant place to be. There's not that much good urbanism happening in Anaheim, but it used to have it, unless you go to Disneyland. That's where the good urbanism is, in Disney.\n\nAnd it's just—I find it ironic that we had to recreate it and now we have to go pay for it when this was our normal standard for years. And I can see the relation to Miyazaki there too in some of his movies. I know you've written about that a little bit as well. And I think part of that is Miyazaki is tapping into full-blown nostalgia on a lot of the things that he's doing in terms of childhood and Japan and another era. And he's really focusing on Japan. He's not really focusing on western nostalgia even though again we can see a lot of meaning and messaging in his work and that's relatable to us.\n\nBut I think both of them, Disney and Miyazaki, tap into a nostalgia for structures and forms and society before modernization, before—whatever our societies look like. Japan looks very different now and I think they're doing a lot of good stuff. But it certainly is true that a city like Tokyo had absorbed all these areas that might have been idyllic countryside.\n\nSo it's different forms of urbanism certainly but they're both tapping in on the same type of nostalgia.\n\nDave Deek: Okay, I think this is a great place to wrap up the interview.\n\nShare\n\nQuestions for the audience:"}

And I’m not even talking about the madness surrounding tariffs, taxes, and international trade wars — I mean that companies will just straight-up lie about their real prices to make “discounts” look good. That’s what HP did, allegedly, and it’s paying a cool $4 million to affected customers.\n\nThat’s the end of a class-action lawsuit that started over four years ago, when two American plaintiffs complained that HP displayed “strike-through prices” on its store that weren’t actually real, thus inflating the discount that it looked like they were receiving. According to the report on Ars Technica, the plaintiffs allege that HP lied about how much quantity was available, in the familiar “only one left at this price” sense.\n\nI say allegedly, because this is a civil suit, not a criminal case of false advertising, and HP has admitted no wrongdoing or liability as a condition of the settlement. It’s basically a $4 million “leave me alone” check. Though the plaintiffs did accuse HP of violating the US FTC’s deceptive pricing laws, it doesn’t appear that any actual law enforcement is involved. And it’s not as if these practices are isolated. The “FOMO” and time pressure sales tactic is omnipresent online, new variations of sales techniques that I remember from the infomercial days and before.\n\nOne personal bugbear of mine is a little company called Lenovo, the largest seller of laptops on the planet by volume. Whenever it announces a new ThinkPad model I truly, genuinely don’t know how much it costs, despite covering its products for over a decade. This is because the “manufacturer’s suggested retail price” often has zero relationship to the price that actually appears on Lenovo’s own shop and third-party sellers. It’s madenning. That’s why you should look very closely at any deal that claims a Lenovo laptop is $1000+ off.\n\nBut back to HP. You’re eligible to join the class-action settlement if you bought a laptop, desktop, mouse or keyboard from HP’s US online store, and it was marked as “on sale” for more than 75 percent of the time between June 5th, 2021 and October 28th, 2024. Products include generic HP, Envy, Spectre, Pavilion, AllinOne, Chromebook, Chromebase, Slim, Victus, and Omen lines, with very specific product numbers. You can get $10-100 back if your purchase qualifies.\n\nFor reference, HP posted 56.3 billion dollars in revenue in 2024."}

Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nThere’s a lot to like about outdoor TV antennas. They offer better and more stable TV reception and usually bring in more channels than indoor models, which is why we always recommend them, but they won’t win any neighborhood beauty contests.\n\nThe Televes Dinova Boss Mix isn’t beautiful, but it does look very different from a typical antenna and is likely to stand out much less when mounted on the roof or the side of a house. It can also be installed in an attic (if you don’t have a metal roof) for even less visual distraction, albeit at the cost of some reception.\n\nThe Dinova Boss Mix provided good reception of all local channels, an impressive feat for an antenna of its size.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe Televes Dinova Mix Boss comes with everything you need to install it, including a short mast if you want to mount it on the side of your house. Martyn Williams/Foundry\n\nThe antenna is enclosed in a white plastic shell with a built-in bracket on the rear for mounting on a pole. You’d typically mount it horizontally, but there could be a situation where a vertical mount would be better, and the bracket accommodates both scenarios. It comes complete with a short mast you can use to mount it to the side of your house; so, everything you need is in the box—apart from the coaxial cable needed to connect it to your TV tuner.\n\nDon’t overlook one of the Dinova Boss Mix’s best features when you unbox it: There are a couple of small, silver nubs on either side of the antenna: Give each of these a tug to extend a set of telescoping antennas and you’ll get better VHF TV stations that broadcast on channels 13 and below. These channels can sometimes be tough to catch with smaller antennas like this one, so that’s a great feature.\n\nBe surre to extend the telesdcoping antennas on each side of the Televes Dinova Mix Boss. Martyn Williams/Foundry\n\nThe antenna’s built-in signal amplifier, powered by the 12-volt power supply you’ll also find in the box, will boost reception.\n\nIn use\n\nAfter installing the Dinova Boss Mix, I found that it provided good reception of all local channels and strong signals from a neighboring market. That’s impressive for an antenna of this size. In terms of the number of channels, it was only a little behind my daily-use antenna, the Televes Dat Boss Mix.\n\nWhile that didn’t matter in the tests, I always prefer to get as strong a signal as possible, especially on more distant stations that can be affected by weather conditions.\n\nThe Televes Dinova Mix Boss viewed from below. Martyn Williams/Foundry\n\nThe Dinova Boss Mix even pulled in a low-power VHF station that presents a tricky signal for me most of the time. Reception of that station wasn’t perfect, but that it was coming in at all showed the antenna’s sensitivity.\n\nThis review is part of TechHive’s in-depth coverage of the best TV antennas.\n\nShould you buy a Televes Dinova Boss Mix?\n\nThe antenna should work well in areas with strong to average reception and will perform better on reception of UHF stations over VHF. PCWorld’s guide to choosing an antenna explains how to determine the signal levels of the broadcast towers where you live before you buy, so check that before making a final decision.\n\nWhether it’s mounted on your roof, the side of your house, or in an attic space, the Televes Dinova Boss Mix offers a more pleasing profile than more typical TV antennas, and it still delivers great reception."}

Do you need a GPU brace to protect your PC?", "fullContent": "If you’ve just gone out and bought yourself the biggest, meanest, and most powerful graphics card in the ‘hood — congratulations! you’re in for a wild time gaming! You may be itching to just install it and load up a game of Atomfall, but you should really pause for a minute and consider how the beast will live in your PC case.\n\nYep, sometimes a big, hefty daddy of a graphics card needs a little extra support around the girdle. Here’s what you need to know about GPU braces and how to tell if you need one.\n\nWhy would you need a GPU brace?\n\nA powerful graphics card is a prized possession that will provide you with hours of glorious gaming fun, but that could be at the expense of your other hardware. How? When a GPU is too heavy for the PCIe slot and the screws that hold it in place it will typically sag downwards and sometimes cause damage — a problem known as GPU droop.\n\nThat can happen with some graphics cards even despite the PCIe slots being reinforced to prevent it happening. It may not droop immediately, but gravity can work away over time, causing the hefty component to bend and bow gradually.\n\nAt risk of the most damage from GPU droop is the graphics card itself, but also the PCIe slot and the motherboard as the weight of the GPU causes strain on these parts. Your PC could also experience data transfer errors or slower bandwidth if the strain causes the GPU to break off connection with the PCIe slot and the motherboard.\n\nHow to spot GPU droop\n\nFirst off, you should remove your case and look for signs of physical sagging. A high GPU temperature or fans working overtime can also be a sign of GPU droop since the sagging can cause the GPU’s heatsink to detach, affecting the component’s ability to cool.\n\nIf you don’t see any GPU droop, but you know you have a heavy graphics card, you should install a brace to be on the safe side. Heavy GPUs can weigh as much 4.7 pounds (an honor that belongs to the huge Gigabyte Aorus RTX 4090 Master) — that’s even more than some laptops weigh. But even GPUs weighing around 2.6 pounds can cause droop.\n\nCustom-built PCs often have tailor-made, unconventional layouts, so they can be especially prone to GPU droop. GPU braces come in a range of different sizes and designs. They also support different orientations, so you can find one that works well with a vertical or horizontal setup.\n\nEven GPUs weighing around 2.6 pounds can cause droop.\n\nSome GPU braces feature attractive RGB lighting that can make a big visual impact. Antec\n\nThe strongest and most durable braces are made from steel and aluminum and designed to last the test of time. Some are also adjustable, magnetic, and/or tool-less, which makes installation easier.\n\nA brace can boost your PC’s look\n\nGetting a brace for your GPU isn’t anything to be embarrassed about. On the contrary, you’re simply safeguarding your hardware and performance and protecting your PC hardware from damage.\n\nIf anything, a brace can even be an excuse to upgrade the look of your PC if you opt for one of the blinged-out RGB braces on the market.\n\nWhen looking for a brace, make sure it’s compatible with your GPU type and case type. The brace should have a weight capacity that can hold your GPU and allow plenty of space between your GPU and case and your PC’s other components.\n\nRemember, your GPU is one of the most important parts of your gaming getup, so treat it right and it will reward you in return.\n\nFurther reading: 4 things to consider before buying a GPU"}

I’m talking about fast, easy changes that improve the feel of the operating system, turn off annoying ads, reduce the data you send to Microsoft, and more. Better yet, you can do them all in under five minutes—something I did mere weeks ago when I needed to pick up a Windows 11 laptop for some travel.\n\nHere are five Windows 11 settings worth changing immediately, with an added bonus at the end.\n\n1. Move the Start button to the left corner\n\nWhat can I say, I’m a traditionalist. I understand Microsoft’s desire to revamp Windows 10’s interface to more closely mirror the style of Macs and Chromebooks—legions of kids get schooled on those, after all—but Windows 11’s shifting taskbar icons drive me batty. (They do help out a lot on ultrawide monitors, though.) I want mousing over to the Start menu to be muscle memory in a set location, not yet another task I have to look at and mentally process.\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\nFortunately, Microsoft makes it easy to move the Start menu back to the left-hand corner. Simply open the Start menu and head to Settings > Personalization > Taskbar > Taskbar behaviors. You’ll see a field labeled Taskbar alignment with a drop-down menu. Change the drop-dox menu from Center to Left.\n\nBoom! Onto the next.\n\n2. Turn off annoying notifications\n\nNext, it’s time to turn off those annoying pop-up notifications. Windows 11 itself spawns some, but the worst offenders are third-party apps, especially if your laptop or desktop came preloaded with bloatware. Making the distractions stop is simple.\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\nHead to Start > System > Notifications. You can turn notifications off universally if you desire. I prefer to work through the list manually, leaving notifications on for critical tools like Slack, Discord, and my antivirus software. (If my AV scanner wants to shout about something, I want to hear it!) Either way, this menu cures many headaches.\n\n3. Turn off Microsoft ads\n\nThat segues neatly into the next tip. Keep scrolling down beyond the bottom of the list of apps that can send you notifications. There, you’ll see a couple of additional boxes that relate to Windows 11 itself providing “tips and suggestions” on how to use your PC. If you know your way around well enough, deselect the Offer suggestions on how I can set up my device and Get tips and suggestions when I use Windows boxes. I personally prefer to leave the Show me the Windows welcome experience… option checked so I’m notified of new features when a big update drops.\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\nWe’re not done yet, though. If you don’t like seeing Microsoft promotions (like Office and Xbox ads) pop up in your Settings app, head to Start > Settings > Privacy & security > General. Disabling “Show me suggested content in the Settings app” does the trick, though you may want to turn off all these options.\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\nFinally, head to Settings > Personalization > Device Usage. The options here tell Microsoft how you use your computer so Windows 11 can provide tailored recommendations for apps, websites, Office 365 trials, and more. Turn them all off if you’re not interested in your $100+ copy of Windows 11 upselling you on more Microsoft services.\n\nThere are other places Microsoft promotions lurk such as the beautiful “Windows Spotlight” lock screens provided by Bing Images, but tweaking this handful of settings eradicates the most irritating ones. If you want to go even deeper, check out 9 tweaks that turn off your Windows PC’s most annoying ads.\n\n4. Change your default browser\n\nMicrosoft Edge is pretty darned good, actually, but if you’re a diehard Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Brave user, switching your default browser is easy.\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\nAfter downloading and installing the browser of your choice, it should ask if you want to make it the default. Do so, duh. But if you missed your chance during setup, navigate to Settings > Apps > Default apps, find the name of your browser in the list, and click on it. A “Make <browser name> your default browser” banner with a Set default button at the top of the page does the trick.\n\n5. Declutter the taskbar\n\nSure, Windows 11’s nerfed taskbar is getting better over time, but it still sucks and Microsoft stuffs it to the brim with icons and features you probably have no interest in. Make it easier on the eyes and reclaim some space by heading to Settings > Personalization > Taskbar and deselecting any of the taskbar items you’ll never use. Adios, Widgets, Copilot, and the Microsoft Store.\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\nWhile we’re on the topic, spending $5 on Stardock’s Start11 or StartIsBack is well worth it. The programs offer granular options that expand the look and functionality of the taskbar and Start menu alike, making it a lot easier to make Windows 11 look like Windows 10. They’re beyond the scope of this article but deserve a shout-out.\n\nBonus: Dark mode, baby!\n\nFinally, an optional personal preference. Some folks like staring at black text on white screens all day. Others, like me, prefer not to sear their retinas. So, the very first thing I always do with a new Windows install is activate dark mode, a preference that carries over into several apps once you’ve set it.\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\n\nSimply head to Settings > Personalization > Colors and look for a field called Choose your mode. Change the drop-down menu from Light to Dark. Your eyes will thank you — and so will your laptop battery, if you’re using an OLED display.\n\nThat’s about it for this rundown of quick Windows 11 settings to change immediately. This rabbit hole goes as deep as you want it, though.

I questioned his choice of words frequently included in his cartoons – but these differences were settled over the phone in an amicable manner.\n\nWhen Yaakov was no longer able to draw his weekly cartoons from his hospital bed – I turned to using some of his old cartoons that still were relevant to the ongoing unresolved 100-years conflict between Jews and Arabs.\n\nThe following cartoon was chosen by me to accompany my latest article: “Israel stakes claim while Trump takes aim”\n\nYaakov had drawn this cartoon to accompany an article I had published on 2 June 2020: “ A revised vision for Judea and Samaria - without the PLO”\n\nThis cartoon is as relevant in 2025 as it was in 2020.\n\nYaakov and I had a true meeting of minds which guaranteed our partnership endured to become what I think is quite unique in the world of publishing.\n\nIn his latter days I used his cartoons in a booklet supporting the commencement of negotiations to implement the 2022 Hashemite Kingdom of Palestine solution – which had emanated in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHis cartoon on the silence of the United Nations refusing to consider the Hashemite Kingdom of Palestine solution was damning – and appeared with this article: “UN continues obscene silence on Hashemite Kingdom of Palestine”\n\nYaakov was out on his own as Israel’s premier cartoonist.\n\nHe received the Israeli Museum of Caricature and Comics’ Golden Pencil Award and the 2014 Nefesh B’Nefesh Bonei Zion Prize for his contribution to Israeli culture and the arts.\n\nHe was extremely proud to be acknowledged and retained by Jewish News Syndicate (JNS) on 23 August 2023 to provide cartoons to that organisation.\n\nIt was my distinct privilege to have shared the last six years of Yaakov’s life in the way we did – including with his amazing wife Sali.\n\nRest in peace dear Yaakov. You have left behind a legacy which few people could ever hope to emulate."}

Tapping away on his iPhone, he writes a goofy, slangy email to his boss and then has the app transform his prose by selecting “Professional.” The manager reads the resulting concise memo and, stunned at the source, asks himself, “Warren?”\n\nWarren has a ghostwriter. In fact, we all do.\n\nI’m hardly alone in thinking AI chat bots such as ChatGPT are a lot like ghostwriting. In an Inside Higher Ed blog post, “ChatGPT: A Different Kind of Ghostwriting,” Ali Lincoln, herself a ghost, finds nothing wrong with using AI to write an outline or even a first draft. After all, she argues, “in both writing and editing, we’ve used some element of AI for many years, such as software that evaluates the readability of a written piece, programs to check writing like Grammarly, and even spell-check and autocorrect.”\n\nAn especially intriguing piece appeared in, of all places, Annals of Surgical Oncology: “A Ghostwriter for the Masses: ChatGPT and the Future of Writing.” The author, a physician, writes mostly positively of the potential uses of ChatGPT to assist in medical and scientific writing.\n\nThrowing this discussion into sharper relief, there is even Ghostwriter OpenAI ChatGPT, an add-in that embeds ChatGPT directly into Microsoft Office. With Ghostwriter, you simply open Word and have the chat bot on the same screen as your document—a ghost in the machine.\n\nThese arguments and recent AI developments have caught my attention, because throughout most of my academic career I moonlighted as a corporate ghostwriter. I wrote magazine articles on scientific topics for a large technical company, articles that were published under someone else’s name, typically a scientist or engineer whom I interviewed for the piece.\n\nMy favorite moment in that role came when I sat down with a manager who was new to the company to discuss a writing project. She handed me an offprint of an op-ed by the division vice president, accompanied by his photo.\n\n“Study this,” she said, a bit officiously. “Everything you need to know is in his article.”\n\nMaybe you see where this is going. Notwithstanding the VP’s smiling face, I’d written every word.\n\nGhostwriting can lead to this sort of haziness about authorial authenticity. But is it unethical?\n\nCertainly, I didn’t think so. I produced what was essentially the voice of the corporation placed in the mouths of its subject matter experts (SMEs) and executives, who were either too busy or incapable of writing the articles. The company hoped readers would contact the SMEs to learn more; they weren’t interested in anyone talking to me. And I was happy to remain in the shadows (yes, with my check).\n\nI explained as much to students in my professional writing classes, where I focused on the business of writing, pointing out that CEOs are no more likely to write their own op-ed pieces than are U.S. presidents to write their own speeches. But they were nevertheless uneasy with the practice. They couldn’t imagine writing anything without getting a byline, even when I explained the concept of work for hire.\n\nGhostwriting is a kind of imposture, presenting to the world writing that is not one’s own. Nevertheless, like the spirits for which it is named, ghostwriting exists in a shadowy realm where things are not what they seem. It inhabits an ethical twilight zone.\n\nKathleen Hall Jamieson stated as much in her groundbreaking work, Eloquence in an Electronic Age: The Transformation of Political Speechmaking:\n\n“When students fail to acknowledge the sources from which their essays are drawn or, worse, when they expropriate the language of another, we righteously cry plagiarism and penalize them; once the student attains the status of senator, congressperson, or president, the rules change. Feigning authorship of another’s thoughts and words is then not only expected but publicly funded.”\n\nWhen Jamieson wrote those words, in 1988, she could not have foreseen how ChatGPT would make ghostwriting available to everyone, not just politicians and celebrities, making questions about its ethicality even more pressing.\n\nI plugged into Ghostwriter OpenAI ChatGPT and asked it to expound briefly on the ethicality of ghosting:\n\n“Ghostwriting is a contentious practice within the realm of ethics. On one hand, proponents argue that it is a legitimate form of collaboration, where the writer’s expertise brings another individual’s ideas to life. It allows busy or less skilled individuals to share their knowledge and experiences through the written word. However, critics argue that ghostwriting undermines authenticity and intellectual integrity.”\n\nThis isn’t exactly an incisive analysis of the topic, but it’s not a bad start. Yes, ghostwriting is ethically contentious. However, and this is a crucial point, it allows “less skilled individuals to share their knowledge and experiences through the written word.”\n\nOf course, the person who turns to AI for these answers may not do any deep thinking about the topic—or any thinking, at all. And this is what we ask of writing, especially in the academic setting, that it serve as a way to wrestle with ideas and arguments, to write our way toward conclusions. Further, this is why the answer to the question “May students use ChatGPT to write essays?” must be a hard no.\n\nStill, we have to face the question of ghostwriting’s ethicality in other instances. When is it allowable? I think for practical, workaday writing chores, AI technology has already won out.\n\nWhen I began teaching professional writing some 40 years ago, I included instruction on putting together an effective memo. I did something similar in numerous training sessions I conducted for corporations. Today, with AI ghosts haunting every classroom and office, this sort of coaching would be like teaching a driver how to read a road map.\n\nUniversities have long privileged writing, introducing students to the academic enterprise in freshman composition classes and making writing central to innumerable courses. Now, the primacy of writing skills is being challenged by the ghosts of AI. And not just for students: I cannot point to any data; however, my experience with colleagues suggests that faculty are using ChatGPT and other AI applications to assist in their writing. A draft journal article I reviewed recently included text stating the authors used ChatGPT to edit their manuscript.\n\nKathleen Jamieson argued that the rules for authorial authenticity change when people become elected officials. Now they change when we have access to the internet.\n\nGhosts are everywhere."}

As reported by The Daily Mail Confid… [+3392 chars]", "title": "Liverpool Consider Move for Lyon Star Amid Release Clause Opportunity", "fullContent": "Liverpool in the Race for Rayan Cherki: Calculated Gamble or Future Star?\n\nRising Talent Drawing Elite Attention\n\nLiverpool are preparing for a critical summer of squad evolution, and Olympique Lyonnais’ Rayan Cherki is back on the radar. As reported by The Daily Mail Confidential, Liverpool are one of several top clubs keeping close tabs on the 21-year-old attacking midfielder, who could be available for as little as £25 million due to a unique clause with his club.\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail Confidential, journalist Nathan Salt notes: “With a verbal agreement on a release clause for around £25million, all of Europe’s elite, including Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain, are now circling a player that they hope has finally flicked a switch on his maturity to make him worth the gamble.”\n\nThis renewed interest follows months of whispers. Fabrizio Romano had confirmed Liverpool’s attention last winter, though no move materialised in January. Now, with Lyon battling financial uncertainty and potential relegation, the French club may be forced into a sale.\n\nPerformance and Profile That Fits Liverpool\n\nCherki’s numbers this season make for impressive reading: 12 goals and 18 assists in 39 appearances in all competitions. But it’s not just the output — it’s the profile that matters.\n\nCherki is technically gifted, tactically flexible, and fits the multi-functional attacking roles that Arne Slot looks to deploy in his front four. Able to play off either flank, as a No.10, or in deeper link-up play, he embodies the kind of fluidity that FSG have traditionally valued.\n\nMore importantly, his age (21), contract status (ending 2026), and relatively low release clause make this a textbook Michael Edwards-style deal. There’s little risk and potentially huge reward.\n\nFinancial Backdrop Driving Lyon’s Decisions\n\nLyon’s situation adds urgency. Facing debts totalling €500 million, the French giants are under pressure to offload assets. The clause, reportedly fixed at £19–25 million depending on variables, has made Cherki an attainable target for Europe’s elite — not just a dream for Liverpool.\n\nThis is no longer a speculative link. It’s a case of timing, opportunity, and strategy.\n\nMaturity the Last Question Mark\n\nAs Salt observes, the issue may not be talent, but temperament. Cherki has been criticised in the past for inconsistency and attitude. But insiders suggest that corner is being turned: “…they hope [he] has finally flicked a switch on his maturity…”\n\nIf that holds true, then this is more than just a clever deal — it’s a potentially transformative one.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFrom a Liverpool fan’s perspective, the potential move for Rayan Cherki feels both shrewd and exciting. He ticks every box — technically gifted, young, versatile, and available at a fraction of the price usually paid for a player with his output.\n\nWith Arne Slot now shaping his squad, signing a player like Cherki could offer something different — a flair player who thrives in tight spaces and could inject unpredictability into the final third. Given our current squad dynamics and the ageing of key attackers, he offers a long-term project with immediate value.\n\nSome fans may rightly question whether he has the mentality to step into Liverpool’s demanding environment. But if Edwards and the recruitment team are satisfied that the switch has indeed been flipped, then it becomes a low-cost, high-ceiling punt — much like the one they made on Mohamed Salah or Diogo Jota.\n\nIf Liverpool can beat off competition from Manchester United and Bayern Munich, this could be the summer’s most quietly significant move."}

While midfield reshuffles and centre-back debates continue to stir up Anfield chatter, it’s the club’s apparent lack of depth at left-back that has many scratching their heads. On the most recent episode of Anfield Index’s The Transfer Show, Dave Davis and Trev Downey tackled the current state of affairs, and one name kept recurring — Milos Kerkez.\n\nKerkez The Clear Target\n\n“Milos Kerkez is the obvious one,” Dave Davis said, referencing the Bournemouth left-back, who at just 20 years old has shown serious Premier League credentials. “We haven’t mentioned [him] in this show yet, but it’s the biggest link that we’ve had.”\n\nIndeed, the Hungarian international has emerged as Liverpool’s most strongly linked defensive target in that position — and perhaps the only one, for now. While previous reports hinted at interest in Wolves’ Rayan Aït-Nouri and Bayer Leverkusen’s Piero Hincapié, those connections have “gone cold” according to Davis and Downey. “All the noise is around Kerkez,” Davis reiterated, suggesting that even Bournemouth are “expecting him to depart.”\n\nWhy The Silence Elsewhere?\n\nDowney reflected on the eerie quiet surrounding alternative left-backs: “There’s been nothing new on Aït-Nouri, and Hincapié seems to have vanished off the radar.” The implication? Arne Slot and his recruitment team may be placing all their eggs in the Kerkez basket.\n\nYet the question lingers — why such tunnel vision? According to Davis, it’s not for lack of talent elsewhere, but possibly down to strategic planning and timing: “They’ve already made provisions because the left-back’s coming… they expect Kerkez to depart.” Bournemouth, it seems, are preparing for life after Milos.\n\nBournemouth’s Warning Shot\n\nHowever, it’s not all plain sailing. Bournemouth, understandably wary of being raided, are pushing back against assumptions that their players are for sale en masse. “Bournemouth are being really clear,” Davis said firmly. “‘We’ve got our own aspirations.’” He cited sources close to the club who made it clear: “You can’t just strip our squad bare… it’s not like a closing down sale.”\n\nThis puts Liverpool in a tight spot. Kerkez may be available, but not cheaply or easily. Bournemouth’s multi-club ownership and ambitious plans under Andoni Iraola make them less likely to roll over when top clubs come calling.\n\nMilos or Bust?\n\nSo, where does that leave Liverpool? If Kerkez is the one, then he must be the right one — not just a fallback. Davis made that point clear: “They’ve already made provisions,” indicating Liverpool believe a deal is feasible. Yet Downey warned about placing too much faith in a single target: “You can’t fight City Hall… once they’re unsettled, the move is inevitable.”\n\nIf Milos Kerkez does land at Anfield, it will mark a significant statement — one of targeted recruitment, but also of missed opportunities elsewhere. The lack of current traction around Aït-Nouri and Hincapié feels less like strategy and more like stasis.\n\nAs Trev Downey summed up, this summer could mark a turning point: “All bets are off… nobody has to pretend anymore.” In other words, when the final whistle blows on the current campaign, expect truths to come out — and deals to be made.\n\nFor now, Kerkez remains Liverpool’s only actively linked left-back. But if the club truly intends to back Arne Slot’s vision, they’ll need more than just one name on their shortlist. Let’s just hope, as Davis put it, “we’re not being gaslit again.”"}

Earlier this year, they sent a team to the Spanish coast, checking out facilities, sizing up the opportunity, and potentially laying the groundwork for a deal. But now, the engine’s cooling. What looked like momentum has slowed to a crawl.\n\nCredit to Spanish outlet 101TV for speaking directly with Malaga’s general manager Kiki Perez, who gave a clear-eyed view of where things really stand — and why any deal is miles away from happening.\n\nLegal red tape and frozen progress\n\n“There’s no real information,” said Perez, speaking to 101TV. “There seems to be a lot of interest, but as far as we know, nothing has progressed.”\n\nThe main reason? A tangled mess of legal restrictions. Malaga remains under judicial administration due to longstanding financial problems dating back to their dramatic rise and fall after the Champions League quarter-final run in 2013. Since 2019, the club’s been caught in red tape, unable to operate like a normal business, let alone close a sale.\n\n“No one has come knocking because there’s a magistrate’s order stating that the receiver is not competent to sell the club,” Perez explained. “Any interested fund or intermediary that calls is referred to them to contact the owner.”\n\nThis means any discussions — whether it’s FSG, QSI (Paris Saint-Germain’s owners), or another party — are effectively deadlocked. The message is clear: unless the legal situation changes, no deal is getting signed.\n\nFSG’s global football playbook\n\nFSG’s renewed push into the multi-club model has been driven in part by the return of Michael Edwards as Chief Executive of Football. His reappointment in 2024 signalled a new phase. It’s a direct pivot from FSG’s earlier stance, when they had kept their focus solely on Liverpool, steering clear of the web of club affiliations like City Football Group’s empire of 13 clubs.\n\nThis isn’t their first swing either. Last summer, FSG were deep into negotiations with Bordeaux, another sleeping giant of European football. That deal collapsed over stadium rental issues — a reminder that football ownership isn’t just about ambition; it’s also about the nuts and bolts.\n\nThe interest in Malaga followed, and it made sense on paper. A historic club, major city, passionate fan base, and potential for growth in both La Liga and European competitions. But paper means little when legal chains are still wrapped around the club’s future.\n\nWhat now for Malaga and FSG?\n\nThe situation remains frustratingly static. Perez put it bluntly: “We have to focus all day long on leaving the club as high as possible so that if someone comes, they can find it as it is, in the best possible condition.”\n\nThat’s admirable from a sporting point of view. But for FSG or any buyer, it means patience. The kind of patience that doesn’t play well in the fast-moving world of global football finance.\n\nFor now, Malaga remains in limbo. FSG’s plans to add a second club to their portfolio are on hold, and fans in Andalusia can only hope that one day soon, the legal storm clears — and with it, a buyer finally gets through the door."}

The Dutchman, who has captained both club and country with poise, remains a pivotal figure as Liverpool navigate a new era under Arne Slot. This latest development is more than just a signature on paper – it reaffirms Van Dijk’s enduring importance to a club built on tradition, ambition and, increasingly, stability.\n\nIn an era where defenders are judged not only by their ability to win duels but also by how they marshal the game from the back, Van Dijk remains peerless. The timing of the contract renewal is key – not just for the club’s planning, but for the message it sends to both the dressing room and the wider football world: Liverpool are not here to rebuild; they are here to contend.\n\nTeammates’ Praise Reflects Van Dijk’s Lasting Influence\n\nWhen assessing Van Dijk’s influence, it’s often tempting to rely solely on data: clean sheets, interceptions, duels won. But the true measure lies in the reverence of those who train with him every day. Alisson Becker captured the essence best: “When you have Virgil van Dijk – the giant – on the pitch, maybe it scares the opposition. For me, he is special… Virgil has something special, he is the big man.”\n\nThat sentiment echoes through the squad. Joe Gomez, one of Van Dijk’s longest-serving defensive partners, described his captain as “probably the best the club has ever had in that position,” emphasising both his technical ability and emotional intelligence. “It’s not even hesitation, he’ll step up and go and speak and represent us all,” Gomez added.\n\nA Role Model for the Next Generation\n\nIt’s not just the experienced players who look to Van Dijk for leadership. Younger squad members like Conor Bradley and Jarell Quansah speak of him as a mentor. “He’s always one of the best players in training every day and that’s something I aspire to be,” said Bradley. Meanwhile, Quansah, emerging into the senior fold, sees Van Dijk as someone who “resonates a lot” with his own journey.\n\nThere’s a thread of quiet mentorship that runs through all these testimonials. Ryan Gravenberch, still finding his feet at Anfield, appreciates Van Dijk’s clarity and guidance. “When you need something you just can ask him and he organises it for you,” he explained, highlighting a trait that goes beyond footballing skill: trust.\n\nStability Key to Liverpool’s future\n\nWith Jurgen Klopp’s departure in May 2024 and Arne Slot stepping into the role, continuity has become more valuable than ever. Keeping Virgil van Dijk at Liverpool isn’t merely about preserving quality on the pitch – it’s about retaining an identity. In Cody Gakpo’s words, “He’s our captain, he’s a great personality, he’s a great player.”\n\nFor all the tactical blueprints Slot may bring, having a leader like Van Dijk ensures those plans have the strongest possible foundation. As Mohamed Salah aptly put it before his own renewal, “I would love to see him here again next year.” Now, he – and Liverpool fans – will get their wish."}

On the latest Molby On The Spot podcast from Anfield Index, former Liverpool midfielder Jan Molby offered a heartfelt but clear-eyed assessment of Robertson’s situation as the club eyes a new left-back signing this summer.\n\nWhile there’s no doubting Robertson’s iconic status – “he’s already a Liverpool legend,” said Trev Downey – the feeling within the club seems to be that evolution is needed. Robertson, now 31, has missed chunks of the season through injury and, as Molby noted, “there’s a feeling that the team now needs to be upgraded in that position.”\n\nBut Molby was adamant that this next chapter won’t be quietly accepted by the Scotland captain.\n\nMolby: “He won’t take it lying down”\n\nJan Molby didn’t hesitate when describing the attitude he expects from Robertson in the face of increased competition. “He won’t take it lying down,” Molby said simply, a phrase loaded with admiration and expectation.\n\nMolby continued: “That boy’s got that bit of spite in him – in the best possible way. He’s not going to roll over just because someone’s been brought in.”\n\nDowney agreed, saying Robertson’s competitive edge and character are what made him a fan favourite in the first place. “He came from Hull, worked his way into one of the best teams in Europe, and played a massive role in every trophy we won under Klopp.”\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nIt’s clear from the conversation that Molby respects the tactical shift underway under new manager Arne Slot. While Robertson remains a potent attacking threat, particularly in transition, Liverpool are reportedly looking for a more hybrid-style left-back – one who can invert and contribute in buildup play in a slightly different way.\n\nMolby believes that while Robertson may not perfectly fit that evolving mould, he’ll fight tooth and nail to prove he still has a place. “He’ll look at whoever’s coming in and say: ‘You’re going to have to be bloody good to take this shirt off me.’”\n\nIt’s a moment of transition for the squad – the end of an era in some ways – but as Molby said, “You don’t lose your hunger overnight, and Robbo’s not that kind of character.”\n\nRobertson’s Role in a New Liverpool\n\nWhether he remains first-choice or not, there’s little doubt Andy Robertson will be central to Liverpool’s 2025/26 campaign. Leadership, experience, and mentality all count for something – especially in a team undergoing structural change.\n\nMolby closed the discussion with a measured but powerful statement: “If he has to adapt or share minutes, he will – but don’t expect him to disappear quietly. That’s not Robbo.”"}

According to Caught Offside, Liverpool are one of three Premier League clubs keeping close tabs on Real Betis forward Jesús Rodríguez — a 19-year-old tipped for a big future in European football.\n\n“Arsenal are one of the clubs leading the race,” the report notes, but Liverpool and Chelsea have both sent scouts to monitor the Spanish U21 international in recent weeks. For a club like Liverpool, traditionally cautious when it comes to unproven youth from abroad, the interest in Rodriguez marks a shift, possibly one driven by necessity more than ambition.\n\nDepth concerns emerge under Slot\n\nArne Slot is stepping into a pressure-cooker environment. The Dutchman inherits a squad that, while talented, has growing question marks in attack. Diogo Jota’s recurring injuries and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Luis Diaz leave holes that need filling. “Liverpool… might also benefit from adding more depth to their front three,” the article rightly observes.\n\nWhile Mohamed Salah has signed a new deal, there’s a realisation that succession planning needs to begin in earnest. Rodriguez, while not a ready-made solution, could be part of that conversation.\n\nBetis braced for pressure\n\nBetis are holding firm, at least for now. “Big offers could force their hand, but there have not yet been any talks or offers made for the player,” say Caught Offside. But that kind of phrasing usually comes before the floodgates open.\n\nWith Chelsea’s aggressive youth recruitment model and Arsenal’s eyes on long-term squad balance, Liverpool will have to weigh up whether Rodriguez is worth the early investment.\n\nRisk or reward?\n\nRodriguez is raw. That’s clear. But for a club built on development and a system-based approach, this could be an opportunity to act before the price skyrockets. Whether Liverpool make that leap could come down to how much faith Slot places in potential over proven pedigree.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nLet’s not get carried away. We’ve seen this before — the endless parade of “wonderkids” linked to Anfield every window. Jesús Rodriguez might have flair, but are we really in a place to take another punt on promise?\n\nArne Slot’s first job should be to stabilise, not gamble. We’ve already got Harvey Elliott, Ben Doak, and a conveyor belt of potential. Do we really need another teenager who’s played a handful of senior games in Spain and has yet to face the relentless grind of English football?\n\nAnd look at the competition. Arsenal are flying, Chelsea hoard young talent like it’s going out of fashion — are we going to win this one? And more importantly, should we even be trying?\n\nWhat Liverpool need is proven depth. Jota’s injuries and Diaz’s uncertainty demand experience, not another developmental project. If Rodriguez comes in, great — but only if it’s part of a balanced summer that addresses now as much as the future.\n\nBecause this club shouldn’t be a proving ground. It should be a destination. And at this point, signing a teenager from Betis feels like a risk we can’t afford if we want to challenge seriously next season."}

While the Liverpool captain’s raw tackle numbers may no longer evoke the invincibility of his 2018-19 peak, when he was famously not dribbled past once in 38 games, his brilliance now lies in what doesn’t happen. Opponents simply don’t take him on.\n\nVan Dijk, now approaching 34, is no longer at the statistical apex of his powers, but that misses the point. As The Athletic noted: “Van Dijk’s positional sense is excellent and when opponents receive the ball with their back to goal, he gets tight and prevents them turning. He’s almost never beaten in that situation, when a player tries to spin him — but he also doesn’t get too tight too early.” That balance between aggression and composure is where he continues to set himself apart.\n\nQuiet Dominance in Duels\n\nIt’s not that Van Dijk can’t tackle — it’s that he doesn’t often need to. One of the most compelling images from The Athletic’s piece is his duel with Erling Haaland: the Norwegian backed into a rare one-on-one but opted for a pressured shot rather than risk taking on the Dutchman. It’s telling. Few defenders can convince elite forwards that retreat or compromise is their best option.\n\nIn another scenario, Bukayo Saka “technically” dribbled past Van Dijk, but under pressure, the England winger could only slice a cross wide. As The Athletic explains, these moments are full of nuance. Statistically, it might look like a failed tackle — but in footballing terms, it’s a defensive win.\n\nMore Than Numbers\n\nThis analysis also reminds us of Van Dijk’s often overlooked recovery pace. The clip of him recovering against Bryan Mbeumo, or against Philippe Coutinho years earlier, speaks volumes. Defenders rarely get second chances. Van Dijk makes them look routine.\n\nEven when he’s physically imposing, he plays with restraint. Consider his duel with Patson Daka, nudging the striker aside in an area “where the referee can’t quite see.” As The Athletic puts it: “Van Dijk knows how much he can get away with, and his reputation as a calm, clean defender helps on the rare occasions he’s a little underhand.”\n\nReputation That Shapes the Game\n\nOpposition game plans subtly tilt away from Van Dijk. Heat maps show strikers consistently choosing to operate on the opposite side. This isn’t coincidence — it’s fear. Fulham’s plan to isolate Ibrahima Konaté and avoid Van Dijk was replicated by others. Watkins, Jackson, Wilson — the patterns are there.\n\nAnd yet Van Dijk remains effective even in situations where he seems passive. The Haaland moment encapsulates it best — defending without making a move, yet shaping the entire action. When attackers do try something special, it’s often out of desperation. It doesn’t come off.\n\nMastering the Mental Battle\n\nVan Dijk himself articulates his method clearly: “You should never be like this (square on)… you go into this position (side on), and pick a side where you want the striker to go, so you put a trap.” He reads body language, studies eyes, and waits for help from teammates. That patience is a rare weapon in today’s high-octane defensive landscape.\n\nIn many ways, this report reaffirms what Liverpool fans and opponents already know: Van Dijk is still the benchmark. His game has evolved — from record-breaking resistance to calculated aura. That aura alone remains enough to dissuade most attackers from daring to engage.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nLiverpool fans have watched Virgil van Dijk with awe for nearly a decade, but this recent deep-dive into his defending reaffirms just how lucky we’ve been to witness it first-hand. While the eye test still tells us he’s world-class, the data adds weight to the feeling that Van Dijk continues to dominate in subtle, often underappreciated ways.\n\nAs supporters, we’ve heard pundits question whether he’d ever regain his form post-injury. This shows he has — just not in the same explosive way as before. His intelligence, aura, and ability to shape a striker’s decisions without touching the ball speaks volumes. It’s defensive football at its most cerebral.\n\nUnder Arne Slot, Van Dijk’s role may evolve further, especially as the tactical shape changes. But if opponents are still building game plans around avoiding him, that says it all. Konaté might grow, Quansah might develop, but Van Dijk remains the sun around which Liverpool’s backline orbits."}

And one of the most eye-catching responses? A simple, heartfelt message from none other than Manchester City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne: “Congrats my man.”\n\nThe Belgian’s comment, posted under Van Dijk’s announcement video on Instagram, added fuel to the already simmering pot of transfer rumours linking him with a potential switch to Liverpool. While nothing concrete suggests the two could become teammates, the context adds intrigue to what might otherwise be dismissed as a routine show of camaraderie between professionals.\n\nVan Dijk’s Contract Signals Belief and Boldness\n\nLiverpool’s decision to extend Van Dijk’s contract by two years goes against modern football’s growing obsession with youth and resale value. At 33, he becomes the oldest outfield player in Premier League history to sign a multi-year extension without a salary cut—no small feat in today’s performance-incentivised climate.\n\nAccording to The Times’ Paul Joyce, Van Dijk is set to earn around £400,000 per week. That figure would make him arguably the highest-paid defender in Europe, and it’s not just about the money—it’s the structure. His new deal emphasises team achievements over individual accolades, highlighting his integral role in Liverpool’s collective ambitions under new manager Arne Slot.\n\nVan Dijk’s message was equally strong in its sentiment: “It was always Liverpool.” That phrase, simple yet definitive, suggests that despite interest from abroad and the inevitable whispers about age and form, his commitment to Merseyside remains unwavering.\n\nDe Bruyne’s Liverpool Links Refuse to Die Down\n\nAs for Kevin De Bruyne, his own future remains a subject of intense debate. Reports from Belgium indicate that a Premier League stay “is possible,” and his Anfield connections are well-documented. His grandfather was a Liverpool supporter, and De Bruyne himself once admitted that playing at Anfield had been a childhood dream.\n\nStill, realism tempers the romance. De Bruyne, also 33, commands a wage that may not align with Liverpool’s current salary structure or FSG’s youth-driven transfer model. His technical brilliance remains undiminished, but Liverpool’s recent strategy suggests they may look elsewhere as they shape the next generation under Slot.\n\nWhat This Means for Liverpool’s Future\n\nVan Dijk’s renewal is symbolic as much as it is strategic. It signals stability amid change, a bridge between Klopp’s legacy and Slot’s new era. It also sends a message to the dressing room and beyond—that leadership, loyalty and proven excellence still have currency at Anfield.\n\nAs for De Bruyne, whether his Liverpool flirtation ever materialises into something more remains to be seen. But in that single, public “congrats,” fans were reminded of how interwoven football’s elite really are, and how past rivalries can morph into mutual respect.\n\nIn a sport often dominated by transactional headlines and short-term gains, the Van Dijk-De Bruyne interaction felt like a refreshing nod to football’s emotional undercurrent. Liverpool, De Bruyne, and Van Dijk: three names, one moment, and countless narratives. Whether or not the Belgian maestro ever dons red, this week, the mutual admiration was loud and clear."}

Assessing Options for a Post-Trent Future\n\nLife after Trent: Planning for change at right-back\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold’s Liverpool journey has been more than just a story of local lad made good. It’s been an era-defining chapter in the modern history of the club — a homegrown talent who revolutionised the full-back role and reshaped how Liverpool build attacks. But with a move to Real Madrid reportedly edging closer, the time has come for Liverpool to contemplate something they never wanted to: life without Trent.\n\nWhile Arne Slot has publicly maintained that “nothing is sorted yet”, the mood around the club suggests otherwise. The 26-year-old has won every major honour in red, and while the emotional cost of his departure will be immense, it’s the footballing void that presents the greatest challenge.\n\nWhat made Trent so unique was not simply his position, but how he played it. Right-back in name only, he was Liverpool’s creative hub, their quarter-back, their tempo-setter. Replacing that isn’t just about filling a spot in the back four — it’s about reimagining how this team moves the ball, breaks lines, and controls games.\n\nWhat Liverpool will miss in Trent\n\nAlexander-Arnold’s numbers speak for themselves. Year after year, he topped charts for chances created, progressive passes, and assists — not just among defenders, but across the Premier League. Under Jürgen Klopp, his role evolved from overlapping full-back in tandem with Andy Robertson to an inverted playmaker stepping into midfield.\n\nSince Slot’s arrival, the tactical shape has shifted again, but Trent’s influence hasn’t waned. He continues to drift inside, acting as the bridge between defence and midfield, often drawing defenders away to create isolation for Mohamed Salah. That role demands supreme technical quality and vision. Few in Europe offer it from full-back.\n\nCriticism over his defending has followed him throughout his career. But under Slot, there have been encouraging improvements. He’s averaging more tackles and interceptions than ever before, suggesting his off-the-ball contributions are catching up with his offensive output.\n\nLosing that combination of creative brilliance and growing defensive reliability will hurt. So what next?\n\nCan Conor Bradley fill the void?\n\nThe obvious internal solution is Conor Bradley. The Northern Ireland international has impressed whenever called upon, but circumstances have conspired against his momentum. Between recurring injuries and Trent’s status as first-choice, Bradley has managed just over 1,000 minutes this season.\n\nStill, there is plenty to admire. The 21-year-old’s tenacity in duels, his aggressive pressing, and intelligent off-ball movement align well with Slot’s high-energy style. His underlapping runs and willingness to stretch defences offer a different look to Trent’s deeper playmaking.\n\nIn a small sample of league minutes last season, Bradley averaged 7.62 progressive receptions per 90 — a marker of his ability to receive passes in threatening areas. That verticality is useful. But can he carry the creative burden? That’s far less certain. And with his injury record, Liverpool may be forced to enter the market for external reinforcements.\n\nTransfer targets to replace Trent\n\nIf Liverpool decides to sign a new right-back, it won’t simply be a like-for-like deal. Slot may look to reshape the backline entirely, especially if a replacement for Robertson is also needed. That makes stylistic fit all the more important. Here are three potential targets who could meet Liverpool’s needs in different ways.\n\nGuela Doue – Strasbourg\n\nAt 22, Guela Doue is already showing the sort of consistency and maturity that Slot may value. A key figure at Strasbourg, Doue has adapted to various roles across the backline, including right-back, right wing-back, and even as a wide centre-back in a back three.\n\nPhysically imposing, positionally sound, and technically assured, Doue’s game is built around forward momentum. He averages 6.8 progressive carries per match and is confident carrying the ball out from deep. That ball progression mirrors some aspects of Trent’s game, though Doue is more conservative in his positioning.\n\nHe also thrives in one-on-one defensive duels, a key quality for any full-back in Liverpool’s system. If Slot opts for a more balanced back four with one adventurous full-back and one more disciplined, Doue could be the ideal fit.\n\nAnton Gaaei – Ajax\n\nDubbed the “Danish Beckham” for his precision crossing, Anton Gaaei has grown into Ajax’s first-choice right-back this season. His delivery is exceptional — powerful, low, and accurate. In 21 Eredivisie appearances, Gaaei has two goals and four assists, and his set-piece prowess adds another layer to his game.\n\nWhat stands out is his ability to cross from both deep and advanced positions, hitting the byline or cutting back into the danger zone. In a recent De Klassieker against Feyenoord, he produced a pinpoint cross to set up the winner in stoppage time — the kind of composure Liverpool would welcome.\n\nDefensively, Gaaei is still learning, but his pace allows him to recover quickly. His overlap and underlap timing is sharp, and while he may not step into midfield like Trent, he can provide width and high-quality delivery consistently. At just 21, he represents a developmental project with real upside.\n\nMartim Fernandes – Porto\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing prospect is Porto’s Martim Fernandes. Just 19, Fernandes is already a key creative outlet for his side and has notched five assists in 21 appearances. He’s averaging 0.31 expected assists per 90 — a remarkable figure for a teenager.\n\nFernandes stays high and wide, pushing defences back with his positioning. He underlaps cleverly, shows confidence in tight spaces, and is an accomplished crosser, averaging 3.61 per match in the Portuguese top flight. His attacking style does carry echoes of Alexander-Arnold’s early days.\n\nDefensively, he has the engine and commitment to contribute, even if he remains raw. But for a club like Liverpool, where development pathways are clear and the environment is stable, Fernandes could be moulded into a long-term successor. His composure under pressure and final-third quality make him an exciting option.\n\nMaking the right decision\n\nReplacing Trent isn’t just about finding the next best right-back. It’s about redefining what that role means within the system Slot wants to build. Whether Liverpool go all in on a creative replacement like Fernandes, opt for the defensive solidity of Doue, or bet on the crossing precision of Gaaei, the decision will shape the team’s identity going forward.\n\nSlot may well look to rotate styles depending on the opponent. That would require depth and versatility — two things Liverpool lacked when they became overly reliant on Trent’s right boot.\n\nThere is no easy answer. Bradley deserves minutes. The market offers potential, but nothing that matches Trent’s unique profile. Ultimately, replacing a generational player requires more than one solution. It demands clarity of vision.\n\nAnd while no one can replace Trent like-for-like, Liverpool must now find a way to evolve beyond him."}

In the latest Molby On The Spot podcast from Anfield Index, club legend Jan Molby and host Trev Downey tackled the significance of the Dutchman’s decision to sign a new contract, delivering a typically insightful and candid assessment of what this means for the Reds under Arne Slot.\n\nVan Dijk, a central pillar of Liverpool’s defence since arriving from Southampton, has inked a two-year extension, a move that brings not only relief but real optimism about the club’s defensive stability. “That’s the thing that’s most encouraging for me – that he’s going to be around to probably train in his ultimate replacement,” said Downey, highlighting the value beyond matchdays that van Dijk brings.\n\nRare Mistakes, Unshaken Faith\n\nThough van Dijk has been under scrutiny in recent weeks for a couple of uncharacteristic errors – moments which quickly made the rounds on social media – both Molby and Downey were clear-eyed in their perspective.\n\n“We focus on his mistakes, Jan, only because they’re so rare,” said Downey, and Molby agreed: “It will always be like that, won’t it? When he makes a mistake… people jump all over that.”\n\nMolby didn’t mince his words when addressing the reaction to van Dijk’s dip. “I think Virg has just kind of gone to the club: ‘Get this contract sorted because otherwise I’m going to carry on playing like this – and this is not what you want to see,’” he said with a grin, implying that the contract resolution might just restore the defender’s calm dominance.\n\nLongevity and Leadership at the Back\n\nWhat sets this new deal apart is the belief in van Dijk’s longevity. “He strikes me as the kind of lad who can play for a long time yet,” said Downey. “It would not surprise me to see another year or two being added on to this two-year contract.”\n\nThe comparison with defensive icons wasn’t lost on Molby. “I look at that boy who left Chelsea last summer, Thiago Silva. Genuine world class, that boy – and so is Virgil,” he said. “If he could play in the Premier League and look really good even at 38… I can’t see no reason why Virgil shouldn’t be able to carry on at least for another three or four years.”\n\nMolby made it clear that this isn’t a sentimental extension but a strategic decision grounded in data. “There’s been stats about Virgil… the defensive stats are just ridiculous. It feels like he never gets dribbled past.”\n\nMentorship Role and the Bigger Picture\n\nVan Dijk’s new deal isn’t just about the short-term fix. It’s a step towards continuity. As Liverpool enter a new era under Arne Slot, having someone of van Dijk’s experience is vital. “Playing alongside Virgil is the thing that helps everybody get better,” said Downey. “Just watching Virgil sweeping up around and doing Virgil bits for another couple of years gives us such an edge on other teams.”\n\nThat leadership role was also emphasised by Molby, who noted, “He’s probably going to train in his ultimate replacement – to bring on someone alongside him that will be able to make the step up. That’s exciting.”\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nWhile Klopp may have handed over the reins, the heart of Liverpool’s defence remains unshaken. Virgil van Dijk’s new contract is more than a piece of paper – it’s a statement. It’s a message to rivals, fans, and teammates alike: Liverpool are not rebuilding; they are reloading, with their defensive general right where he belongs.\n\nIn a season already marked by transition, the van Dijk renewal is a grounding force. As Jan Molby put it with understated confidence, “Virgil… world class. So is this deal.”"}

The … [+3597 chars]", "title": "Liverpool’s £60m Question: Should Xavi Simons Be the Next Move?", "fullContent": "Is Xavi Simons the Right Fit for Liverpool’s Creative Void?\n\nCreative Conundrum at Anfield\n\nLiverpool’s search for creativity continues under Arne Slot, and as Dave Davis put it on Transfer Market Metrics, the name Xavi Simons is firmly “back on the docket”. The Dutch international is causing a split opinion—what Davis called a “Marmite name”—as fans and analysts debate his suitability for the Reds.\n\nWith the Reds currently struggling to consistently unlock low-block defences, Phil Barter highlighted a crucial issue: “Liverpool’s creativity is a bit of an issue at the moment without Trent in the side… we need it badly.” That concern sets the stage for why Simons, currently at RB Leipzig, is being seriously considered by the recruitment team.\n\nTactical Fit and Versatility\n\nAt just 22, Simons has already racked up international experience and shown positional flexibility, primarily playing as a left winger and attacking midfielder. Davis noted, “It’s important to say he’s split between left wing and attacking midfielder… we do like versatility.”\n\nBarter broke down Simons’ profile with precise metrics. As an attacking midfielder, Simons falls into “the 70th percentile for non-penalty goals” and “88th percentile for passes attempted”—suggesting he’s a proactive passer, even if he “doesn’t receive the ball progressively that well.” His shot-creating actions (4.78 per 90) point to real attacking value, although Barter admitted, “If you are buying him to be a creator… 48th percentile for assists is a little bit low.”\n\nWhen compared to Dominik Szoboszlai, Simons holds his own. “He actually outperforms Dom in terms of carries, take-ons… and shot-creating actions,” said Barter. But Dom edges him out in “pass completion, non-penalty goals, and defensive blocks,” areas Liverpool often value in midfielders.\n\nLeft-Wing Potential and Role under Slot\n\nWhen analysing Simons as a left winger, the story shifts. “Cody [Gakpo] pretty much monsters him on all metrics apart from non-pen xG,” said Barter. Off the ball, Simons lags significantly—“tackles, interceptions, blocks, clearances… all in the red”—but once in possession, he excels: “90th percentile carries and passes progressively.”\n\nThis duality feeds into Slot’s tactical vision. Davis pointed out, “If you look at Slot historically, he’s had a creative player in the attacking line… not always pace merchants.” Simons could operate in that “attacking midfielder left half-space,” feeding more direct runners like Salah or a potential addition such as Kirk—as Davis suggested, “supplying the bullets for a number nine.”\n\nPrice Tag, Potential and Questions\n\nSimons’ reported £60 million price tag may be divisive. Barter summed it up well: “I don’t think he’s a huge upgrade… he’s in the rough ballpark of two of the players that currently play the positions.” The cost raises questions about value for money, particularly when Barter noted, “If you’re buying for creativity… apart from when he plays as a wing, he doesn’t do that as a second mid.”\n\nYet, his Bundesliga numbers—nine goals and five assists—plus a respectable expected threat (xT) rating, do place him “level with Diaz, above Mack, above Dom,” according to Davis.\n\nStill, deep blocks remain Liverpool’s nemesis, and Barter expressed caution: “I’m not sure Xavi is your man to do that… because there’s no space behind to play an incise pass.”\n\nFinal Verdict – Marmite Metrics\n\nBoth contributors reached a cautiously optimistic conclusion. Davis remarked, “He’s a creative player, he’s a playmaker—we need more threat… none of that is debatable.” But whether Simons becomes a nailed-on starter or a flexible option from the bench is still open to debate.\n\nAs Davis fittingly summarised, “People will like this player or they won’t… it will just come down to that.” Whatever fans decide, one thing’s certain: Liverpool are scouting with intent, and Xavi Simons is firmly in the conversation."}

The Premier League encounter at the Amex Stadium is now scheduled for 8pm BST on Monday, 19 May, and will be broadcast live on Sky Sports in the UK.\n\nThis penultimate fixture could carry substantial weight depending on the league standings. Whether it’s a final push for European qualification, the title race, or Brighton aiming to disrupt the ambitions of a top-six rival, the timing ensures it will be played under the full glare of the Monday night lights.\n\nTactical Battle Between Emerging Ideologies\n\nWhile Brighton continue to define themselves as one of the league’s most tactically astute sides, Liverpool’s evolution under Arne Slot adds an intriguing layer to the encounter. The Dutchman, having taken the reins following Jurgen Klopp’s emotional departure in May 2024, is steadily embedding his philosophy – possession-based, positional, but with the high-tempo pressing that has defined Liverpool’s recent identity.\n\nBrighton, under Fabian Hurzeler, have long since discarded their status as plucky underdogs. They’re technicians now – a side as capable of dominating possession as they are at soaking up pressure and striking on the counter. This fixture is more than a calendar shuffle; it’s a chess match in motion.\n\nBroadcasting Boost and Fan Anticipation\n\nMoving the match to Monday evening gives it standalone billing on Sky Sports, a slot traditionally reserved for games that promise drama. From a broadcast perspective, this isn’t merely about accommodating schedules – it’s about maximising reach.\n\nAs the business end of the Premier League season intensifies, matches like Brighton v Liverpool take on added value, not just in terms of points but narratives. Who finishes strong? Who falters under pressure? The answers, often, lie in these final flickers of the campaign.\n\nFinal Stretch: Every Point Counts\n\nBy the time Liverpool arrive at the Amex, their fate could still be in flux. Slot’s side will be seeking consistency in both performance and result, while Brighton could be aiming to derail a title hopeful or seal their own continental ambitions.\n\n“Liverpool’s penultimate Premier League game of the season at Brighton & Hove Albion will now take place at 8pm BST on Monday May 19,” the club confirmed.\n\nAs ever in this league, timing is everything."}

His insights, shared on the latest episode of No Tippy Tappy Football, paint a picture of evolution, development and masterful man-management under Arne Slot. As Liverpool chase another Premier League crown, Lee highlighted how two players — Ryan Gravenberch and Cody Gakpo — have taken centre stage.\n\n“[Arne Slot] has nurtured them. You see the evolution of the likes of Gravenberch, Gakpo… fantastic to see,” Lee explains. “They may have been better players anyway, the second season in, but they are blossoming and flourishing now. A lot of credit to the recruitment department because, recruitment is huge.”\n\nSlot’s role cannot be understated. In less than a year, he has done more than steady the ship post-Klopp. He’s helped key players move from potential to prominence.\n\nFrom Raw Promise to Refined Excellence\n\nGravenberch, who arrived for £34 million from Bayern Munich, has flourished. While his first season under Jürgen Klopp had moments of flair, it lacked sustained purpose. Slot has changed that. Gravenberch now looks composed, intelligent and assertive — a midfielder who glides rather than grinds.\n\nSammy Lee sums it up: “Gravenberch has been fantastic. Like a lot [of the Liverpool players], they have had a little bit of a dip of late. Maybe nerves have taken over because they are so close. But he has been fantastic.”\n\nCody Gakpo, meanwhile, has gone from useful contributor to clutch performer. With goals against Manchester United, Manchester City, Real Madrid, and Bayer Leverkusen, he’s delivering on the biggest nights. He’s equalled his goal tally from last season — but in 10 fewer games.\n\nSmart Business Behind Smart Football\n\nLiverpool’s reported £70 million outlay for the Dutch duo now looks like shrewd business. Compare that with the sums spent elsewhere in the Premier League on less consistent performers — Enzo Fernandez, Antony, Mykhaylo Mudryk — and the difference in value and output becomes clear.\n\nLee was quick to praise the club’s eye for talent, adding: “A lot of credit to the recruitment department because, recruitment is huge.”\n\nEven Gravenberch’s agent, José Fortes, couldn’t hide his belief in the midfielder’s rise, recently suggesting the Dutchman is “good enough for Real Madrid.” Fortes admits a move is “impossible” now — a testament to his client’s development and contentment at Anfield.\n\nCulture, Continuity and Confidence\n\nPart of Slot’s success stems from shared heritage and familiarity. He knew of Gakpo and Gravenberch from his Eredivisie days. That rapport, coupled with a clear playing philosophy and system that maximises their strengths, is proving transformative.\n\nSlot hasn’t just inherited players — he’s reignited them.\n\nOur View – Anfield Index Analysis\n\nFor fans, seeing Ryan Gravenberch and Cody Gakpo evolve this way has been deeply satisfying. We always knew the talent was there, but under Arne Slot, they’re beginning to look like players you build a team around — not just squad depth or rotational options.\n\nGravenberch now looks like a £60m midfielder, not just the lad who couldn’t break into Bayern’s XI. The way he bursts through midfield and holds off challenges brings back flashes of peak Gini Wijnaldum with added elegance.\n\nAs for Gakpo, he’s becoming our big-game guy. Those goals against top-tier sides? That’s what Liverpool players are judged on. He might not start every week, but when it counts, he delivers — and that’s what makes him invaluable.\n\nSlot’s fingerprints are all over their growth. Calm, composed, familiar yet fresh. This doesn’t feel like a coincidence. It feels like a plan — a project coming together. And for once, as fans, we don’t have to worry about post-Klopp regression. With Slot in charge and players like Gravenberch and Gakpo flourishing, the next era might be just as exciting."}

Known for her tearjerker comics that shed light on important issues, Jenny’s newest work explores the themes of death and life through the stories of beloved pets—a loyal dog, a devoted cat, and cherished pet parrots who have crossed the rainbow bridge.\n\nJenny shared with Bored Panda that her passion for drawing has been a lifelong obsession: “My mother always said I drew before I could walk. I picked up a pencil when I was a kid, and I never stopped scribbling. Yes, I always wanted to be an artist. I wanted to tell stories and create worlds.”\n\nBefore you scroll down, we have to warn you that these stories may gently tug at your heartstrings.

She thinks his job is sad and lonely, even though he has a friendly nature. People often blame him for things and treat him badly.\n\nBut Jenny wants us to know that the Reaper is just part of life too. She believes that if anyone really understands and likes him, it’s life itself.\n\n“Sometimes I still hear them”\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: jenny_jinya\n\nBored Panda reached out to Jenny once again to delve deeper into her creative process. The artist breathes life into emotions through her artwork, so we asked about the inspiration behind her comics with such emotional and impactful themes. Jenny explained, “In Germany, we have the word ‘Weltschmerz’, we use it to describe ‘painfully felt melancholy that someone feels about their own inadequacy’. You read and hear so much about so many terrible things in this world and you can’t do anything to solve all these problems. This was the feeling behind the first Loving Reaper comic about an abandoned dog waiting for his family. I thought to myself, this happens millions of times every year, I hope death is kinder than humanity.”\n\n“Life and Death decided to exchange roles”\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: jenny_jinya\n\nCreating art that evokes deep emotions is a powerful skill, but it also raises a question about the emotional impact on the artist. We were curious to know, on a personal level, how Jenny navigates and copes with the emotional toll her work might take on her. “As I have to look at and read through lots of articles and photos of sick or injured animals every day, it really gets to me,” the artist shared. “But I try not to become numb to these things. It has made me more aware, more grateful, and more concerned. I also try to help outside of my comics by making donations or teaming up directly with organizations for comic projects. The most recent one was Barba.no, a Norwegian Arctic exploration and education organization. Or once with Rewriting Extinction and SeaSheppert, or Rewild. This topic is sincerely important to me, I try to do what I can. But it is actually the messages from my readers that give me the feeling that I am not alone in my efforts and that it is truly worthwhile. I feel like part of some kind of ‘international community’ that is striving for a better tomorrow.”\n\n“Mystery solved!”\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: jenny_jinya\n\nAccording to Jenny, it is very difficult to write a story worth reading about every serious problem. “Some people accuse me of not covering topics, but the fact is, there are thousands of topics I would like to write about! I’m a one-woman show, I don’t have a team behind me and my comics demand a lot from me. The story has to carry the topic so that people want to read it, that just takes time.\n\nBut it’s all the more rewarding when a story works and is well received. As already mentioned, I am often cheered up by the stories of my readers when they tell me how they have taken in street cats or adopted sick and old animals and thus saved their lives. All the big and small sacrifices that people make. There are thousands of people out there who are really trying to help the animals in their area, but you don’t see these people in the news. They are the unsung heroes of our time, while politicians rarely pass laws to help animals. It’s good to know they are there, it keeps my hope in humanity as I read about human cruelty on a daily basis.”\n\n“They will always wait for you”\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: jenny_jinya\n\nThe artist mentioned that she often receives messages from readers about both big and small heroic deeds. These messages bring her a lot of joy, but what’s interesting is that people are doing these good things on their own, not just inspired by her comics. “But sometimes they actually say that one comic or another has encouraged them to do so. When I published ‘Black Cats’, I received countless photos of newly adopted black cats and the comment that ‘it’s all my fault’ (in a humorous way). Sometimes I get updates on how well they are doing. Sometimes I get reports that donations have been made in my name or that animal shelters have named an animal after me. That’s really cool!\n\nBut what I get a lot of are messages from people of all ages telling me that they haven’t been able to cry for ages but some comic of mine has finally broken the dam. It’s just so nice that my little short comics can have such an effect. It makes me so unspeakably happy.”\n\n“For the friends who wandered and never returned”\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: jenny_jinya"}

And the truth is that we often learn as much from our clients and event attendees as they do from us. They tell us about some incredibly creative ideas and projects, and we help them fine-tune the process of getting from where they are to where they want to be.\n\nToday, I want to share seven of the most common and prolific rituals and routines we’ve seen repeated by the most creative people we’ve worked with over the years, that keeps them ahead of the pack…\n\nIt’s often said that creativity can’t be contained — that creative inspiration and ideas arise suddenly out of nowhere and then fail to show up when we need them most. And while that may be true to an extent, when you look at the broader picture you realize that sustained creativity — having lots of creative ideas over time — doesn’t come from a flash of brilliance or a single moment of inspiration. It comes from a consistent set of rituals and routines that serve as the bedrock for getting remarkable things done:\n\n1. They commit to and engage in meaningful pursuits.\n\nMarcus Aurelius once said, “Stop whatever you’re doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won’t be able to do this anymore?”\n\nOne of our coaching clients brought that quote to my attention about a decade ago. Today I have it pinned to the bulletin board in my home office. It stops me from squandering my most precious resource: my time.\n\nCreativity as both a lifestyle and a profession is a daring adventure, and a truly rewarding one. To thoroughly love what you do while also being fulfilled financially and emotionally is an aspiration and a challenge. That aspiration can become a reality, but it takes lots of hard work, dedication, and some luck that eventually comes from persistently doing the right things. Which is why you must remind yourself on a daily basis of what’s actually meaningful to you, and fully commit to the actions that yield progress in that area of your life.\n\n2. They establish healthy baseline rhythms and triggers.\n\nMaya Angelou only wrote in small hotel rooms. Jack Kerouac made sure to touch the ground nine times before sitting down to write. And many of the artistic clients we’ve worked with over the years have done everything from meditating, to singing, to running, to doing hour-long weight training sessions immediately prior to working on their creative projects. For example, take a look at our client Fay’s morning routine, which she says was inspired by things she learned from the renowned choreographer Twyla Tharp. Here’s what Fay recently told us:\n\n“I begin every weekday with one simple ritual: I wake up at 6 a.m., put on my workout clothes, call an Uber, walk outside my home, and the Uber driver takes me to my gym. I workout for an hour and fifteen minutes, and then I take a leisurely fifteen-minute jog back home. The important part of the ritual is not the training I do at the gym or the jog; what’s important is getting in that Uber every morning and getting the day started in the right direction. The rest just falls into place. I get home feeling good and ready to work.”\n\nThink about your days. How are they structured? What triggers your creative (and productive) mind? Are you consciously structuring your days with these triggers in mind?\n\nWhether it’s waking up early, working in a specific location, or hitting the weights first thing in the morning, you need to figure out what gets you into rhythm — your rhythm. When you design a healthy daily routine that’s triggered automatically every day, you save lots of mental energy for the creative thinking that comes naturally when you find yourself in your rhythm. Through this personalized routine you will bring out your most intuitive work.\n\nOf course your routine will change occasionally due to evolving circumstances. The idea is that you make the necessary adjustments and maintain one that works — one that maintains the necessary rhythm to develop and nurture your creative mind, and to ultimately get you from where you are to where you want to be. (Read “The War of Art”.)\n\n3. They observe mentors and study the work of experts.\n\nIf you study the lives of enough successful creators, it becomes obvious that most world-class performers in all fields — musicians, entrepreneurs, artists, dancers, etc. — had incredible mentors, coaches or role models who made the activity of practice worthwhile and rewarding.\n\nIf you can speak with a mentor face to face, that’s incredible — do so! But keep in mind that just observing a mentor works wonders too. When we observe someone we want to learn from, and we have a crystal clear idea of what we want to create for ourselves, it unlocks a tremendous amount of motivation. Human beings are socially inclined and, when we get the idea that we want to join some elite circle up above us, it really motivates us to achieve greatness. “Look, they did it. I can do it too!” It may sound overly simplistic, but spending time studying people who are great is an essential building block for mastering your craft and cultivating your creativity at the same time.\n\nIn his bestselling book “Mastery”, Robert Greene emphasizes the importance of studying the work of others using Mozart as an example. Here’s an excerpt:\n\n“Throughout his career, Mozart never asserted any particular opinions about music. Instead he absorbed the styles he heard around himself and incorporated them into his own musical voice. Late in his career he encountered for the first time the music of Johann Sebastian Bach — a kind of music very different from his own, and in some ways more complex. Most artists would grow defensive and dismissive of something that challenged their own principles. Instead Mozart opened his mind up to new possibilities, studying Bach’s style for nearly a year and absorbing it into his own vocabulary. This gave Mozart’s newest music a fresh and surprising creative quality.”\n\nThe bottom line is that studying mentors and other experts can help you diversify your own creative output, cross-pollinate ideas and strategies, and introduce you to new approaches and ways of thinking. Not everything others do will be relevant to you of course, but it will help refine and develop your style and tailor it to your own unique creative goals.\n\n4. They lean on and trust their own intuition.\n\nIntuition is very real and something that is never wise to ignore; it comes from deep within your subconscious and is derived from a combination of your previous life experiences and your instinctive snap judgements about the present. If everyone else is telling you “yes” but your gut is telling you otherwise, it’s usually for a good reason. When faced with difficult decisions, seek out all the information you can find, become as knowledgeable as you possibly can, and then listen to your God-given instincts.\n\nCreative people know that trusting your intuition is equivalent to trusting your true self, and the more you trust your true self, the more control you have over making your biggest goals and wildest dreams come true, just the way you envision.\n\n5. They schedule in plenty of downtime (for daydreaming).\n\nCreative types know that, despite what their grade school teachers likely told them, daydreaming is anything but a waste of their time. While structured routines are important for the actual process of creating, our minds need downtime filled with the freedom to ponder and wander.\n\nNeuroscientists have found that daydreaming involves the same brain processes associated with imagination and creative thinking. According to psychologist Rebecca L. McMillan, who co-authored an interesting research paper titled Ode To Positive Constructive Daydreaming, daydreaming can actively aid in the “creative incubation” of ideas and solutions to complex problems…\n\nPerhaps that’s why we sometimes get our best ideas while taking a long, hot shower.\n\n6. They schedule in new experiences.\n\nWhen they’re not daydreaming in their downtime, creative types love to expose themselves to new experiences, sensations, and states of mind. This willingness to stretch themselves is a significant predictor of their creative output, because creative growth often begins at the end of a comfort zone.\n\nOf course a big part of this process happens parallel to being “in rhythm,” working hard to stretch your creative and intellectual muscles. But new little experiences help balance out the consistency of effective routines — they give perspective and force you to think differently. So make an effort to try something new at least once a week. It can be a whole new activity or just a small experience, such as talking to someone new about something that interests you. Once you get the ball rolling, many of these new experiences will open doors you can’t even see right now…\n\nAnd with a strategy of continuous small, scheduled steps into new experiences, you are able to sidestep the biggest barrier to creative progress: fear.\n\n7. They gradually turn life’s obstacles around.\n\nMany of the most iconic novels, songs, and inventions of all time were inspired by significant life challenges. Therefore the silver lining of these challenges is that they were the catalyst to the creation of some pretty epic masterpieces. In fact, an emerging field of psychology called Post-Traumatic Growth has suggested that many people are able to use their hardships and limitations for substantial creative and intellectual development. Specifically, researchers have found that hard times can actually help people grow their long-term contentment, emotional strength, and resourcefulness.\n\nThe bottom line is that life’s problems and obstacles often force us to be creative with solutions. When our view of the world as a safe place, or as a certain type of place, has been shattered, we are forced to reboot our perspective on things. We have the opportunity to gradually look out to the periphery and see things with a new, fresh set of beginner’s eyes, which can be extremely beneficial to creativity and personal growth in the long run. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in detail in the Adversity chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)\n\nLet’s keep moving forward, creatively.\n\nWalt Disney once said, “Around here we don’t look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we’re curious — and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.”\n\nThat’s one of my favorite quotes. It inspires me to write and create, and to move on to my next piece of work even when I catch myself judging my last piece of work as “not good enough.”\n\nFor a decade and a half, Angel and I have been publishing new articles every week on Marc and Angel Hack Life. Sometimes the ideas and words come easier than others, and there have been plenty of times when I’ve felt like my work was sub-par…\n\n“I thought this was a great article! Why aren’t people reading and sharing it?” Or I’ll feel like I fumbled through an article only to watch it receive 25,000+ shares on social media. Regardless of which outcome I’m dealing with, I’ve come to realize one thing: As human beings, we are often terrible judges of our own creative work. We are just too self-critical to see the truth most of the time. And not only that, it’s not our job to judge our own creative work. It’s not our job to compare it to everyone else’s work, or to how we thought others would perceive it. There’s usually no point in doing that. Instead, it’s our job to create. Our job is to share what we have right now in this moment. Our job is to come as we are and give it our best shot.\n\nThere are people in nearly every career field who make each day a work of art simply by the way they have mastered their craft. In other words, almost everyone is an artist in some way. And every artist will have the tendency to judge their own work. The important thing is to not let your self-judgment keep you from doing your thing and sharing your creative gifts with the world.\n\nJust like Walt said, the key is to “keep moving forward.”\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nYes, it’s your turn to exercise your creative genius today! But before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay.

Think again.\n\nApple’s smartphones are packed with clever features, but many of the best tools are buried deep in menus or quietly added with the latest iOS 18 updates — and chances are, you’re not using them to their full potential.\n\nWhether you’ve had an iPhone for a while or just picked up one of the best iPhones on the market as a new device, there’s always something extra to discover.\n\nI've listed seven genuinely useful features here that are easy to miss but incredibly handy once you know where to look.\n\nHere’s how to unlock the hidden potential of your iPhone — no app downloads or extra tools required.\n\n1. Record and transcribe phone calls (Image: © Tom's Guide) Recording and transcribing calls on your iPhone is brilliant for interviews, reference calls, or just remembering what someone said. After placing a call in the Phone app and the person has answered, look in the top left corner of the screen and tap the Start Call Recording symbol, which looks like a series of vertical lines. Next, tap continue. A voice will announce the call is being recorded. When you’re done recording, touch the red Stop button located in the middle of the screen or hang up the call. Your iPhone will automatically generate a transcription of the call, which can be found in the Call Recordings folder in the Notes app, or in Voice Memos if you’ve recorded audio separately.\n\n2. Identify plants and animals using your camera (Image: © Tom's Guide) Snap a photo of a mysterious plant or critter, and your iPhone can now help you figure out what it is. After taking the picture, open it in the Photos app and tap the Info button at the bottom of the screen. If your iPhone recognizes the subject, a little sparkle icon will appear — tap it and Look up plant and you’ll see a suggested identification. You’ll also get options to learn more via Safari or Wikipedia. This trick works with a wide range of flora and fauna, and it’s built into iOS, so there’s no need to install a separate plant ID app. Whether you’re hiking, in your garden, or just curious about what you passed on your morning walk, your iPhone now doubles as a handy pocket naturalist.\n\n3. Offload apps instead of deleting them (Image: © Tom's Guide) Running out of iPhone storage is frustrating. Just when you're about to capture an important moment, that dreaded \"Storage Full\" message appears. But there's a way to get some of that precious storage space back, without deleting apps or purchasing more storage. To do this, go to Settings, General, iPhone Storage and browse your apps list. For applications you rarely use, tap on one and select Offload App. This smart feature removes the app itself but keeps all your personal data, documents, and settings. When you need the app again, simply tap its icon and it reinstalls automatically with all your information intact. The space savings shown as App Size is what you'll reclaim, while your personal data stays safely on your device.\n\n4. Turn your iPhone into a white noise machine (Image: © Tom's Guide) Hidden in the Accessibility settings is a seriously useful feature — background sounds.\n\n\n\nIf you’re trying to focus, sleep, or soothe a fussy baby, your iPhone can play calming white noise, ocean waves, rainfall, or a trickling stream. Just head to Settings, Accessibility, Audio & Visual, Background Sounds, toggle it on, and select your preferred sound. You can adjust volume independently of other audio and even add it to your Control Center for quick access. It’s a simple feature, but it can make a big difference in your daily routine — especially when you’re traveling, trying to work, or just need a mental reset.\n\n5. Schedule a text to send later (Image: © Tom's Guide) Whether you're trying to be respectful of someone’s time, or just not that person sending texts at 2am, scheduling messages can be a lifesaver. Your iPhone lets you do this directly in the Messages app. Type out your message, then tap the + symbol next to the text box. Choose Send Later, pick the date and time, and your phone will automatically send it for you — no reminders or alarms needed. It’s great for birthday wishes, reminders, or timed check-ins. And if you change your mind, you can edit or cancel the scheduled message before it sends. Once you’ve used it, you’ll wonder how you lived without it.\n\n6. Share Wi-Fi passwords with a QR code (Image: © Tom's Guide) If you’ve ever had to slowly read out a long Wi-Fi password to a guest (or worse, spell it out character by character), this one’s for you. Your iPhone now lets you generate a QR code for your Wi-Fi network — and anyone can scan it to join instantly. To do this, launch the Passwords app, select the Wi-Fi network that you want to share, then simply tap Show Network QR code. A QR code will appear that others can scan with their phone’s camera. It’s especially helpful if someone’s using an Android device, or if you’re hosting a group and want to skip the repeat explanations.\n\n7. Hide your screenshots (Image: © Tom's Guide) The ability to automatically filter out screenshots from your main photo view addresses a common pain point for many iPhone users. This immediately hides all screenshots from your main gallery view without deleting them, creating a much cleaner browsing experience focused on your actual photographs. To use this feature, open the Photos app, tap the filter icon, select View Options, and uncheck Screenshots. What makes this feature especially valuable is that it doesn't require any ongoing management. Screenshots remain accessible when needed through the Albums tab, but they no longer crowd your main photo stream. For someone who takes dozens of screenshots daily for how-to articles, this feature is an absolute game-changer.\n\nNow you've learned 7 underrated iPhone features you're probably not using, why not take a look at some of our other useful iPhone articles?\n\n\n\nCheck out I've been testing iOS 18 Photos — and these 5 features make a huge difference and iOS 18.4 has dropped — 5 new iPhone features to try first. And if you're sick of AI summaries on your iPhone, here's how you can switch them off."}

The impacts of such damage can be felt most persistently in the realm of apparel. Increased sensitivity (hyperesthesia) coupled with unusual pain responses to ordinary stimuli (allodynia) can make ordinary fabrics, seams, and tags feel unusually (and even unbearably abrasive). Partial or complete numbness can make it harder to put on clothes and easier to sustain accidental injuries in the process.\n\nIn this third and final article of Broken Plexus, a series about the role of design in long-haul recoveries, we’ll consider clothing and material challenges in light of conflicting sensory nerve inputs. This segment will also serve to close a larger loop on nerve damage more broadly, which started with motor nerves in the preceding mini-series, Single Handed, on adaptive one-handed designs – fully half of that six-article series also revolved around apparel.\n\nSensory nerve damage may seem secondary to motor impairment – it’s certainly less obvious from the outside – but the effects can be nonetheless pervasive and frustrating. While my own sensory damage hasn’t been as directly observable, reflections of it can be found in my apparel. Over the past year, the interplay of changes in my physical condition and demands of different seasons created ever-evolving clothing requirements, pushing me to radically reshape my wardrobe.\n\nRedressing a Newly Malfunctional Wardrobe\n\nIn the weeks and months following a severe brachial plexus injury (BPI) last spring, I slowly began to regain a feeling in parts of my impacted right shoulder, arm, and hand. But the progress was piecemeal and patchwork. In some places, I still couldn’t feel anything on or near the surface of my skin. In other areas, even brushing the cotton of my softest t-shirts felt like the scraping against sandpaper.\n\nMy once-comfortable clothing no longer covered my needs. Ultimately, I had to box and shelve most of my upper-body apparel, hoping that I might at some point unpack it if my sensitivity situation improved. Meanwhile, I needed to find new alternatives I could comfortably wear, at first for impending summer needs and later for subsequent seasons.\n\nSpringing into Summer with Hypersensitivity\n\nInitially, my entire arm was numb. Then, as parts of it woke up, they did so in pain — and layered on top of that baseline, my skin proved unpredictably sensitive to all kinds of stimuli. Fibrous cotton was a non-starter. Even my softest wool tops, including merino tees, scratched painfully. I was lucky, at least, to have been injured in late spring – so the layered complexities of fall and winter wear were still a ways out.\n\nThrough testing, I found myself able to tolerate certain synthetics, such as spandex, nylon, and polyester. So I honed in on hiking outfitters and similar stores in search of options. Trying things on led me to select some “Sahara” tees made by REI, plus similarly outdoorsy Lightweight, Daily, and Trail shirts from Patagonia’s “Capilene Cool” line.\n\nMeanwhile, as some nerves woke with shouts of protest, a large swath of my shoulder and some patches along my arm stayed stubbornly silent. The ulnar (outside) half of my right hand also remained numb – an area including my pinky and ring fingers. Compromised nerves pathways simply weren’t conveying sensory signals to my central nervous system. As autumn rolled around, persistent numbness went from being a curious nuisance to a practical impediment.\n\nFalling Toward Winter, Numbness at Hand\n\nWith fall weather came a search for long-sleeved apparel. I looked at extended-arm versions of t-shirts I knew worked already. But I found my injured hand getting hung up inside the elastic tangle of synthetic sleeves. Jammed fingers bent awkwardly as I tried to guide through my motor-impaired arm down thinly clad corridors; the smooth sleeves lacked structure, tending to collapse and bunch up.\n\nEven in more loose-fitting shirts, a lack of tactile feedback (and absence of visual cues) frustrated my attempts to make long-sleeved options work. And I worried about doing additive damage by regularly forcing my hand down uncooperative paths. So I focused on what I could more easily control, working around rather than with my problematic limb.\n\nFeeling (comfortably) out of step with seasonal orders of operation, I started wearing warm winter hats and thick wool scarves before most of my fellow Minnesotans around me. As needed, I also added a zippered puffer jacket for some arm protection (though I to left it perpetually open in front rather than constantly wrangling a zipper with my one functional hand). The sleeves being both structured and smoothed helped accommodate numbness and hypersensitivity, respectively, while the unzipped front made it easier to don and doff in general.\n\nWeathering Minnesota’s “Second Season”\n\nAs the saying here in Minnesota goes, “we have two seasons: winter and road repair.” As city repair crews rushed to wrap up projects, I had to face the reality of further cladding myself against even colder weather. The demands of the state’s most punishing season put increased pressure on multiple nerve damage-related fronts.\n\nMitts & Starts: Handling a Multi-Pronged Paradox\n\nIt was clear that my impaired hand would need shelter from the cold, especially with numb nerves unable to gauge temperature or associated damage. Gloves were a no-go as I couldn’t feel half of my hand, making it even more difficult to guide motor-damaged fingers into place. Even mittens presented numbness-related issues. Pairs layered for warmth had gaps between their liners and shells, which presented an unfortunate opportunity to snag an errand finger and thus jam my hand; normally helpful, wrist loops could also hook digits.\n\nMeanwhile, though some parts of my hand were numb, others remained hypersensitive, adding (by now familiar) material considerations to the mix of variables. Strangely enough, these overreactive nerves also had something in common with their numb cousins: their noisy reports made it hard to gauge actual harm.\n\nDespite mixed signals, I did objectively determine that the cold more quickly and thoroughly impacted my injured right hand — thanks to my left hand and its five-digit control group. Comparing the pair after a stint outdoors highlighted a stark difference in temperature. That was perhaps just as well, as I had to keep working left hand more accessible for functional reasons — being non-dominant, it was clumsy enough without a glove or mitten getting in the way. So I focused on the other half of the pair, ensuring the right had protection from the elements.\n\nStrangely, amidst this confluence of complications, the mundane quest for winter mittens also served as a reminder of progress made to date, benchmarked against complete numbness and paralysis at the outset.\n\nNumbness: Say what you will about proverbial glasses and their relative fullness, but while you could frame the situation in terms of half my hand being numb, that also meant that the other half wasn’t.\n\nSay what you will about proverbial glasses and their relative fullness, but while you could frame the situation in terms of half my hand being numb, that also meant that the other half wasn’t. Hypersensitivity: It did take a fair bit of testing, but I was also able to find mittens with wool linings that worked … even on sensitive nerves that had once rejected anything but smooth synthetics.\n\nIt did take a fair bit of testing, but I was also able to find mittens with wool linings that worked … even on sensitive nerves that had once rejected anything but smooth synthetics. Motor Control: And while I couldn’t control much, I was able to pull my impaired fingers a bit closer together to aid my other hand in putting on a mitten – not terrible compared to complete immobility.\n\nDon’t get me wrong — putting a mitten on with one hand was (and is still) a huge pain due to remaining sensory and motor impairments (and I’ve clipped that wrist strap to keep it from catching odd digits). But I’m glad that this wasn’t an apparel problem I had to face at the outset. Of course, gloves aren’t a complete solution. There remains a loose thread … which leads us back to the question of long sleeves.\n\nLong Sleeves: Clothing Up a Last Loose Thread\n\nLike it or not, I couldn’t ignore long sleeves completely – in this state, there are always those sub-zero days with double-digit wind chills. But finding wool-lined mittens that worked suggested that wool sweaters were worth another look, and sure enough: I found a quarter-zip merino from Kuhl that would serve on extreme-weather days.\n\nOnce again, this solution had to work on multiple fronts. While still not completely settled, my hypersensitive nerves tolerated the sweater’s fabric. Sturdier than the synthetics, the arms had more structure to limit the risk of snagging stray (numb) fingers. The quarter-length zipper also made the sweater easier to put on while eliminating an concern about two zipped halves coming apart completely.\n\nAll the same, my situation resulted in a strange system of outfit priorities. T-shirts underpinned everything, naturally. Hat and scarf came next. Then, instead of a long-sleeved option: a knee-length wool jacket with a smooth silky liner and three large, easy-to-use buttons. Finally, when all above the above were not enough: a sweater and (right) mitten for the coldest of cold days as a last resort.\n\nNerve Endings: Once More With Feeling\n\nAnd now, as I write this, the snow has melted and potholes are in bloom around the Twin Cities; road repair has started up again, and I’m relieved at the return of t-shirt season. I’m also pleased to report that I’ve begun to unbox some items I had put away. The softest of my familiar old wool sweaters and cotton shirts have started to feel wearable again, and in some cases even downright comfortable.\n\nMy prognosis continues to remain a perpetual unknown — doctors are (perhaps rightly) hesitant to predict future progress. Things may level or or continue to improve over the coming years. I do at least know that I’ve exceeded their recovery expectations (and mine) over this first year. Still, in this as in other aspects of life: I prefer to expect the worst — that way virtually any outcome is an upside surprise.\n\nSo the seasons have come full circle … as have two series (containing the first nine articles I’ve written since my injury): Single Handed, on adaptive one-handed designs, and Broken Plexus, on assistive designs for brachial injuries and long-haul recoveries.\n\nI didn’t set out to start and end these arcs on the subject of apparel, but it seems fitting. Hindsight in (my working left) hand, the seasonality of clothing has become one of the ways I recall recovery milestones – thinking back to picture the world around me, and remembering how I have needed to adapt or design ways to fit myself into it along the way.\n\nAdapt or Design (A Project in Three Acts)\n\nOver the course of three articles, Broken Plexus covered designing an organized exercise workbook, optimizing slings and braces, and (in this piece) apparel to accommodate nerve damage. But this set of three articles is also (collectively, if confusingly) the second of three acts.\n\nThe preceding mini-series, Single Handed, formed the first act, covering an array of design adaptations for people living with one functional hand. The act following this series, Left to Write, is a three-piece set about adaptive one-handed writing technologies, including specialized keyboards and custom setups.\n\nBroadly, Adapt or Design is about how adaptive designs (and design adaptations) can help address everyday challenges following a debilitating injury and over a long-term recovery. The name references a dilemma I’ve faced repeatedly with respect to post-injury problems: whether I simply need to adapt, or design some fix, or (ideally) find and employ an existing adaptive design solution. The AoD logo design nods to the current condition of my arm, which operates a lot like one of those “claw games” at arcades — you know: the ones that eat fistfuls of quarters as you awkwardly attempt to fish out a chosen prize!\n\nOn the Expanse (of AoD) by 99% Invisible’s Kurt Kohlstedt\n\nWhat started as a single article about adaptive design expanded to become this three-act mega-series, now nearly complete. So thank you, dear readers (and colleagues), for putting up with my puns and supporting this challenging but deeply rewarding process — reflecting, researching, and writing this out for the world to see also helped me gain perspective on this surreal past year.\n\nIf someone had told me I would be writing all of these articles in such a short span of time a few months back, I’d have been more than a little skeptical. I’m still relearning the process with new tools — but I’m getting ahead of myself. For more on that, you’ll have to stay tuned for the final act. After that, well, stay tuned as I shift back to more conventionally nerdy 99pi stories!\n\nP.S. Severe brachial plexus injuries are relatively rare, so I was disappointed (if not surprised) to find the net lacking vibrant online community of BPI sufferers. With that in mind, I’ve co-launched a subreddit for people who want to share stories, pro tips, life hacks, and of course: adaptive designs.\n\nPersonally, I have only met one other person with a severe BPI – and that encounter only occurred because we happened to both be at the same specialized medical facility at the same time. He was four years into his recovery at the time, and I was also the first person with a BPI he had met.\n\nHe and I were both thrilled with this chance encounter. And it got me thinking about all of the isolated sufferers out there — nodes in search of a network. So please: share this series and the new reddit BPI community link with anyone in your orbit who may be interested, and feel free to come join us as well."}

They reflect us back to ourselves, showing our weaknesses as well as our strengths, our shadows just as much as our light.\n\nThe reason AI functions as a mirror is that AI is trained on us—on vast datasets collected from human outputs. In a very real sense, we are all teachers now, because potentially any of our digital activities and outputs could be used to train AI systems.\n\nAs the American historian Henry Adams put it: \"A teacher affects eternity. He can never tell where his influence stops.\" Now that we have that power, we had better think about how to use it wisely.\n\nAs I explain in my newly published book, Transcend: Unlocking Humanity in the Age of AI, we can be responsible stewards of our current and future AI systems. In this post we’ll look at steps we can all take to ensure that AI develops in a safe and sane direction.\n\nTeachers of AI\n\nTo think and act wisely in our role as teachers of AI, it's helpful to understand how AI systems, and specifically large language models (LLMs), work. LLMs are the systems we have the most agency over in our use.\n\nLLMs are trained on enormous datasets made up of human-created content: books, articles, websites, reports, social media posts, and more. From these, the models learn statistical relationships between words and phrases. They don't understand meaning in the way humans do, but they become highly skilled at predicting what kinds of language typically follow a given prompt.\n\nCrucially, our interactions with AI systems can still influence their future development—but not in the way many people imagine. Most models don't learn on the fly from individual users. However, companies often collect aggregated user inputs—including prompts, completions, and feedback—to help fine-tune future versions or to inform supervised updates. If you give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, or if you opt in to share your data, you may be helping steer how future models behave.\n\nResponsibility for Shaping AI\n\nLet's be clear—systemic issues require systemic solutions. The responsibility for shaping AI isn't purely an individual responsibility. Companies developing AI models and applications have significant responsibilities, and so too do governments and regulatory bodies.\n\nBut this doesn't mean that we don't have a role to play as individuals. Through our individual actions, we contribute to what AI will become, and this is an enormous power. Given that AI learns from us, given that we shape what it will become, we must acknowledge our power and be intentional about using it responsibly.\n\nWhat Can We Do?\n\nTo navigate these responsibilities effectively, we need to remember that AI stands as a mirror to humanity. And mirror, by fortunate coincidence, also provides a helpful acronym for the practical actions we can take to guide the future trajectory of AI:\n\nM indfulness\n\nindfulness I mpact\n\nmpact R esponsible Consumption\n\nesponsible Consumption R eport Problems\n\neport Problems O ngoing Education\n\nngoing Education Reflective Growth\n\n1. Mindfulness\n\nWe need to cultivate digital mindfulness. Mindfulness means maintaining awareness that our digital activities will shape the nature of AI and the future of the world. A mindless tweet, an exaggerated review, or a hasty comment might seem inconsequential in the moment. But collectively, this is the raw material that AI is learning from.\n\nAction Steps: Practice conscious content creation—before posting, ask: \"Is this something I want AI to learn from?\"\n\nBe aware of your digital footprint.\n\nChoose engagement thoughtfully.\n\nExample: Before posting a negative restaurant review after a disappointing meal, you pause and think about modeling constructive criticism rather than emotional venting, focusing on specific details that provide helpful feedback.\n\n2. Impact\n\nImpact is about deepening our understanding of consequences. Understanding our impact also means recognizing that abstaining from engagement is itself a choice with consequences. When diverse voices opt out of AI interaction, the resulting systems can become skewed toward the perspectives of those who remain engaged.\n\nAction Steps: Consider potential harm.\n\nConsider downstream effects.\n\nReflect on collective consequences.\n\nEvaluate second-order impacts.\n\nWeigh long-term implications.\n\nExample: When signing up for a healthcare app that uses AI, you might consider how sharing anonymized data could help improve diagnostic accuracy for underrepresented communities, recognizing that individual decisions can support more equitable AI outcomes.\n\n3. Responsible Consumption\n\nIn a market-driven economy, our consumption choices send powerful signals to companies building AI systems. When users flock to services that prioritize ethical considerations, transparency, and user control, the industry takes note.\n\nAction Steps: Research company approaches before adopting AI tools.\n\nSupport ethical development.\n\nValue transparency.\n\nPrioritize privacy.\n\nAvoid harmful applications.\n\nExample: When an AI image generator fails to disclose how it trains on human-created work, choosing alternatives that are more transparent and compensate artists sends a message that ethical sourcing matters.\n\n4. Report Problems\n\nDavid Morrison, former Chief of the Australian Army, once said: \"The standard you walk past is the standard you become.\" If we allow problematic outputs to pass by unchecked, we contribute to a future in which problematic outputs become the normal standard for AI systems.\n\nAction Steps: Use reporting tools available on AI platforms.\n\nBe specific when describing problems.\n\nDocument serious issues.\n\nShare with oversight groups when appropriate.\n\nFollow up when possible.\n\nExample: When an AI assistant provides biased information about a cultural topic, take a screenshot and submit it through the feedback form with a clear explanation of why the response was problematic.\n\n5. Ongoing Education\n\nAI is evolving rapidly. Ongoing education means committing to continuous learning about AI, because the better we understand it, the more able we are to influence its development intentionally.\n\nAction Steps: Learn AI basics.\n\nDiversify your information sources.\n\nJoin public conversations.\n\nShare knowledge.\n\nStay curious.\n\nExample: Set aside time once a week to read about AI trends and ethics, or follow a podcast during your commute. Even small efforts can build confidence and literacy.\n\n6. Reflective Growth\n\nStructured mental health assistance and counseling for psychological challenges is now one of the most common use cases for generative AI. AI systems reflect back patterns in our individual and collective behavior—and many of these patterns might otherwise remain invisible to us.\n\nAction Steps: Notice your reactions to AI outputs.\n\nExamine revealed patterns.\n\nIdentify growth edges.\n\nCultivate self-compassion.\n\nExample: After using a fitness app with AI coaching that keeps recommending high-intensity workouts despite your preference for a gentler pace, you might pause to reflect on both the app's limitations and your own resistance, gaining insight into your fitness approach.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI is already changing our world in profound ways, and its influence will only grow. None of us can shape the future of AI alone—not as users, not even as developers. Systemic safeguards and public accountability are essential. But each of us does have a role to play.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing we can do to make AI better is to work on ourselves. We have the opportunity to consciously shape AI to reflect who we are at our best rather than our worst. This means detaching from harmful behavior patterns—distraction, division, shallow relationships, and convenience for its own sake—and devoting ourselves to what truly matters: freedom, connection, service, and love."}

Kriger send PetaPixel the following statement, emphasis his:\n\n“After reflection, I have come to the conclusion that my counter-notification, though submitted in good faith and rooted in what I believed to be a justifiable position, has caused unnecessary strain — not only for Don personally, but also for the photographer community your platform serves.\n\nI have decided to withdraw my counter-notification with YouTube and allow the takedown to stand. (see the message I sent to YouTube below). This is not an admission of wrongdoing, but rather a gesture of goodwill and a sincere desire to bring the matter to a respectful close. I want to apologize for any harm or disruption this situation may have caused, especially to an artist and a community I do not wish to alienate or burden.”\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nKomarechka, best known for his nature and macro photography, carefully created “Maple Leaf Flag,” seen above, over a few months in late 2008 and early 2009, and it has become his signature image with significant commercial value. As such, it has its own licensing terms that go beyond the rest of Komarechka’s work.\n\nUnfortunately, like many photographers, Komarechka deals with people stealing his images, sometimes for nefarious reasons, other times because of ignorance concerning rights and image ownership. As for which side of that line the latest copyright kerfuffle exists, it will depend on who is asked.\n\nEnter Canadian Boris “Bruce” Kriger, who produces educational content on YouTube on his channel Altaspera. Kriger used Komarechka’s “Maple Leaf Flag” photo as part of a thumbnail on a recent video about helping Ukrainian refugees in Canada, which led Komarechka to issue a copyright strike on YouTube against Kriger, which resulted in the video being removed.\n\nKriger initially claimed that the video was lost forever as he did not have a copy of it stored anywhere, but that story has shifted slightly in the days since the conflict began. The argument rapidly escalated, briefly entering the public sphere.\n\n“The video it accompanied was non-commercial, created to help a Ukrainian refugee learn how to start a small business in Canada. But instead of reaching out, Don used an automated copyright enforcement system to file a takedown against the entire video — not just the thumbnail,” Kriger tells PetaPixel, emphasis his.\n\nKriger says he reached out “respectfully” to Komarechka, a characterization Komarechka disagrees with, and offered to remove the thumbnail voluntarily.\n\n“I reached out respectfully. I acknowledged the issue, offered to remove the thumbnail voluntarily, and asked him to retract the strike. He refused and demanded a retroactive license fee of €635 (~$1,000 CAD). I was shocked. For a background fragment of a maple leaf. In a thumbnail. For a free educational video meant to help someone in need.”\n\nFor Komarechka’s part, he says he did not “demand” a license fee. Rather, he says that he told Mr. Kriger that the DMCA strike would be removed if he licensed the image he used. In the event that the license was not acquired, Kriger’s Altaspera YouTube channel would have the strike for the typical 90 days.\n\n“No conflict, no issue,” Komarechka says. “If he had a copy of the video, he could simply re-upload it with a different thumbnail.” The photographer says he did not check the box on YouTube that would prevent future copies of the video from being uploaded to YouTube.\n\n“All Mr. Kriger needed to do was re-upload the video without the thumbnail.”\n\nKomarechka uses DMCA takedowns in non-commercial instances of copyright infringement and when “there is no possible way of pursuing damages in commercial uses due to geopolitical origins of the infringement, particularly when infringements occur in Asia or the Middle East.”\n\n“I send over a thousand DMCA takedown requests a year, for countless images in my portfolio. It’s just the way things are done, in order to avoid many vitriolic conversations. It makes the process inherently not personal, which is for the better,” the photographer tells PetaPixel.\n\nKriger, like other creators who are hit with DMCA takedown requests on YouTube, had the option to file a counterclaim. This requires that he agree to various things, “under penalty of perjury,” per YouTube, that he believes his video was hit with a DMCA takedown by mistake or misidentification.\n\nThis claim does not hold water based on various interactions between Komarechka and Kriger, as Kriger readily admits that the image he used was, in fact, Komarechka’s and that he did not have the rights to use it.\n\n“The biggest part of this problem is Mr. Kriger’s use of the counterclaim process that YouTube offers. In the counterclaim, a legal statement made under penalty of perjury, Mr. Kriger stated, that ‘I now understand that the original photograph is titled Maple Leaf Flag by Don Komarechka.'” Komarechka tells PetaPixel, noting that the quoted claim above is included in Kriger’s counterclaim on YouTube.\n\n“This is the critical piece of the puzzle, that he understood that the image was mine when he made the counterclaim. Mr. Kriger filed a legal counterclaim that also included the statement ‘I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief the material was removed due to a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.’The material was not removed by mistake or by misidentification, which is proven in the exact same counterclaim he makes,” Komarechka says.\n\nWhile false copyright strikes are something that can happen on YouTube, that is not what happened in this case. And because Kriger filed a counterclaim, Komarechka’s options are limited: He can either file the necessary injunction, which costs money, or give up the fight, which, for reasons that will become evident, is not satisfactory to him, either.\n\nFor commercial infringements, Komarechka partners with PicsRights, a copyright enforcement company, and works directly with lawyers in certain situations when dealing with commercial entities.\n\nA Deleted Medium Post With Lofty Ambitions\n\nIn a now-deleted post on Medium, “Digital Extortion and the Maple Leaf,” Kriger argued the merits of Komarechka’s ownership claims and occupied the role of a victim.\n\n“I published a non-commercial, educational video on YouTube — one of over 1,600 I have created over the past eleven years — sharing insights into Canadian business culture,” Kriger writes in the deleted article, which PetaPixel preserved, with the comments, while it was live. “The video was freely accessible, without ads, monetization, or sponsorship. It featured original spoken content and a thumbnail background that included a faint, low-resolution fragment of a stylized maple leaf arrangement found through a standard Google Image search.”\n\n“That thumbnail would become the reason my entire video — nearly an hour of work — was erased from the internet and no backup copy was left.”\n\nKriger then notes that Komarechka no longer lives in Canada, which, for some reason, comes up throughout the saga despite being irrelevant. Komarechka’s rights to protect an image centered around Canadian symbolism because he’s not currently living in Canada.\n\nKriger further alleges that Komarechka engaged in the “commercial weaponization of national symbolism — turning an artistic representation of Canada’s flag into a toll gate, and punishing educational creators for mistakes made in good faith.”\n\nKomarechka and Kriger agree on some basic points. Komarechka owns the image he created and is within his legal rights to protect its copyright. It is a very nice photograph that requires artistic and technical skills. Both parties further agree that copyright is, at its core, an essential means of protection for creative works. Interestingly enough, they agree that the situation is absurd, although it is safe to assume they arrived at the same destination in drastically different ways.\n\nHowever, the two disagree vehemently about where legality and ethics overlap, or, in Kriger’s view, don’t.\n\nDoes the Context of Theft Matter?\n\nMuch of Kriger’s now-deleted argument and emails he sent to Komarechka rely heavily on the idea that his unauthorized misuse of Komarechka’s image was done “in good faith” by accident and that Komarechka morally overstepped by opting to file a copyright strike, which poses a genuine risk to Kriger’s Altaspera YouTube channel in the event he runs afoul of copyright laws again. Kriger believes that given his channel’s content and educational nature, Komarechka responded disproportionately to the offense.\n\nThe comments on Kriger’s post, which presumably come from those who follow his work concerning philosophy, science, and society, generally agreed with Kriger on this point.\n\n“Frankly, it’s hard to believe this is even up for debate. The photographer is clearly in the wrong here — not legally perhaps, but ethically, without a doubt,” one commenter wrote. This commenter noted that the image does not appear in Google Images with any visible licensing obligations — which is not entirely true, by the way — and that the image was used for educational, non-commercial content and should, therefore, not be subject to typical legal restrictions.\n\nConcerning how Komarechka’s image appears in Google Images search results, it is true that Komarechka’s image appears with default search filters. However, it will not appear if people search for Creative Commons images, which one should do if they intend to use an image without licensing it or asking permission. Something being searchable in Google has absolutely no bearing on whether it is protected by copyright.\n\nKriger sent PetaPixel a screenshot of how he came across Komarechka’s image on Google, which is included below.\n\nAnother commenter says that Komarechka is committing a scam by asking for a license fee for using his image, a ridiculous assertion.’\n\n“You’re not acting like an artist. You’re acting like a copyright bounty hunter,” another commenter alleged.\n\nKomarechka popped into the comments on the Medium post, noting that his image is no less protected by copyright because it appears in Google Images results without licensing filters attached.\n\n“Not only do I own the copyright to the image in question, which you clearly acknowledge, it is also registered with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office in addition to the US Copyright Office,” Komarechka comments.\n\nHe also directly responds to Kriger’s complaint that he lost the only copy of his video because of the copyright strike.\n\n“I cannot be responsible for you using YouTube as a place that holds the only copy of your own creative works,” the photographer says. “As a creator of content, backup strategies should be an essential part of the creative process.”\n\n“My copyrighted material was used by you without license, permission, or knowledge in any form,” Komarechka continues. “It was used to advertise (thumbnail for a video, akin to the cover of a book) your own creative work. If you choose to give your work away for free, this is your choice…\n\n“In your final email to me, you published this article and then continued to comment on our interactions, stating directly: ‘If YouTube removed the strike and not you — the publication will remain. Forever. MEDIUM IS A POWERFUL PLATFORM IT WILL SHOW FIRST IN SEARCHES FOR YOUR NAME.'” The emphasis is from Kriger’s email to Komarechka, which PetaPixel confirmed independently.\n\nKriger responded to Komarechka on Medium, inviting Komarechka to share the video thumbnail in question to show, in Kriger’s view, how little of the actual thumbnail included Komarechka’s photograph. PetaPixel readers are invited to judge for themselves — the thumbnail is near the beginning of this article.\n\nKriger adds, “Let’s be honest: Without the use of a specialized reverse image detection tool, this would never have been noticed at all. No human eye scrolling past that thumbnail would have identified your work — nor would anyone have believed it to be ‘theft.'”\n\nHe also admits that the video is not gone forever and that he has a backup. However, he contends that since he cannot reupload the video to YouTube, it has experienced “public erasure,” which he equates to it being lost.\n\nKriger believes that regardless of the actual legal situation, Komarechka is wrong in the court of public opinion. He also maintains that his emphasized comment to Komarechka above is not a threat.\n\n“It was a fact: articles on Medium are highly ranked in search results. My statement was meant to underscore the permanence of public discourse in the digital era — and the potential reputational cost of treating accidental use as a license violation worthy of takedown. You chose a legal path; I chose to respond through ideas and words. I stand by that.”\n\n“I did not seek conflict. I sought to understand how something as small as a symbolic background image could justify the destruction of meaningful, helpful, compassionate content. That question remains unanswered,” Kriger writes. “I have no personal hostility toward you. I believe in your right to defend your work — but also in the need to balance that right with context, reason, and humanity.”\n\nAs for why Kriger deleted the Medium post, he says it was a gesture of goodwill.\n\nNational Symbolism and Copyright\n\nAlthough the dispute between Komarechka and Kriger quickly escalated and wound up heading in all sorts of directions, there is something rather interesting here concerning copyrighting national symbolism.\n\n“Your photo is based directly on a national symbol — the Canadian flag. You followed its proportions exactly, with a maple-leaf arrangement representing a nation, not a personal invention,” Kriger wrote to Komarechka in an email the photographer shared. “While your photograph is artistic and expressive, it is also a derivative of a public domain image, a collective identify that belongs to all Canadians.”\n\nKomarechka replied, noting that his image is “certainly an homage to a national symbol of Canada,” but that his photograph is the result of a lengthy creative process and “not covered by anything related to Public Domain.”\n\nIn an email to PetaPixel, Kriger maintains that this situation “reveals a deeper issue” and raises important questions concerning the line between copyright protection and “predation.”\n\n“When the symbol of a nation becomes a commercial trigger, when a maple leaf — a shared cultural icon — is turned into a copyright trap hidden among Google search results, we must ask: where does protection end and predation begin?”\n\nAs it stands now, the law is entirely on Komarechka’s side on this matter, and the image is, as the photographer says, registered in the Canadian copyright database. If someone, Kriger, or anyone else wants to contest that claim, legal avenues are available.\n\nKomarechka prepared the vibrant red leaves in the autumn of 2008 by ironing them between wax paper and then preserved them until he could place them on freshly fallen snow on a bright, sunny day with no wind. He captured the final photograph, with the use of a polarizer to cut down on the waxy surface, in January 2009.\n\n“To admire artwork is also to respect it, and the creator of that artwork, and to understand the laws and values associated with creativity,” Komarechka said.\n\nKomarechka is no stranger to this specific image being misused and stolen. He’s dealt with it for a long time. He even commented on the matter on Image Rights back in 2016:\n\n“When I see my work misappropriated on various corporate and commercial websites, it breaks my heart. There seems to be a pervasive attitude on the Internet that if something can be found through a search engine, then it must be free and in the public domain. The disregard for the intellectual property of others is not only a frustration, but it hurts all artists financially.”\n\nKomarechka is also no stranger to having the rest of his portfolio stolen and misused.\n\n“It’s not just my Maple Leaf Flag image that gets infringed, my entire portfolio is subjected to these treatments,” the photographer tells PetaPixel. He sent numerous examples of situations where his work was stolen, including in Middle Eastern television programs, foreign films, and more. In the last image below, one of Komarechak’s images is in the background.\n\nFurther Escalation\n\nKriger believed his Medium article would win over the hearts and minds of the internet by “detailing how a man who no longer lives in Canada has turned the image of Canada’s flag into a tool of monetized takedowns and automated copyright threats.” While the article is gone, many of the same arguments Kriger made then, he has made to PetaPixel separately.\n\nKriger’s article outlined the ways in which he would publicly tie Komarechka to a perceived moral wrong, including through “absurd” licensing fees, harming educational content on YouTube, targeting people who make good faith errors, and how Komarechka would not be able to file a lawsuit because it would not make sense given the relatively low amount of the supposed “absurdly” high licensing fee.\n\nKriger also says Komarechka’s copyright strike has “already caused real and irreversible harm.”\n\nAfter the Medium article had been published, Kriger noted that it would be published in multiple languages and reflected the beginning of a broader conversation that would grow and be republished across various platforms in additional languages, again alluding to the potential to harm Komarechka’s reputation, as Komarechka sees it.\n\n“I believe the public will understand where justice lies when the facts are laid bare,” Kriger said.\n\nIn follow-up emails, Kriger said he was going to write a book as “the story had taken on a life of its own — far beyond thumbnails and copyright claims.”\n\nHe also thanked Komarechka, seemingly sincerely, for providing him, a “broke, health-handicapped” person, with entertainment.\n\n“It’s rare that the stage is built, funded, and lit entirely by the other party,” Kriger said.\n\nIf the matter ultimately ends up in court, Kriger appears excited to publicly discuss and argue about copyright’s ethical and cultural limits. It is within his rights to argue over these matters, although this case seems unlikely to lead to a complete transformation of copyright laws in the digital age.\n\n”This is not just a legal process. It’s a public theater. And if you go forward, the curtain will rise — at your expense, and at the cost of your reputation,” Kriger says, concluding that perhaps a hypothetical legal case will raise the question, “Who is Boris Kriger?”\n\nNow What?\n\nFurther email correspondence crossed the line into overtly personal territory that will not be discussed publicly as it does not directly pertain to the matter. However, within the exchanges, a few things are immediately clear.\n\nBoris Kriger passionately believes his educational content is of significant value to people and should not have been hit with a copyright strike. He thinks, at least in part, that Komarechka’s use of the copyright tools that exist to protect artists and their creative work is predatory.\n\n“I have deep respect for artistic work — Don’s included — and I acknowledge his authorship of the image in question. However, I believe the reaction to my use of a low-resolution, partial background element in an educational video was disproportionate,” Kriger tells PetaPixel over email.\n\n“I found the image while searching Google for visuals that evoke Canada. There was no watermark, no license information, no indication of restriction. The image appeared among many others freely available, often in public domain, and was shown in a context where national symbols — especially flags and maple leaves — are expected to be shared and unowned. I used just one leaf — a small, symbolic fragment. Had I known it was registered and protected, I would have gladly chosen any of the thousands of free alternatives. I had no intention of infringing on anyone’s creativity.”\n\nKriger also believes that he acted with goodwill during the dispute, including deleting his post on Medium, acknowledging Komarechka’s authorship, and expressing forgiveness for things he believes Komarechka has done wrong during their interactions. Kriger also believes he has adequately apologized for his image theft, although it has not moved Komarechka.\n\n“Don continues to escalate the situation even though the image has been removed and there is no ongoing infringement. He now accuses me of dishonesty for filing a counter-notification — a legal and justified action based on my good faith belief that the takedown was mistaken. I stand by that decision. It was not a lie — it was my sincere attempt to defend a disproportionate loss,” Kriger continues.\n\n“I believe this situation calls for compassion and proportion, not punishment. And I hope readers will reflect not only on legality, but on fairness, humanity, and the meaning of shared symbols in a digital age,” Kriger concludes.\n\nFor Komarechka’s part, he maintains that this is not personal and that it is unfortunate that copyright infringement is so pervasive across the internet. Just because it happens a lot “does not make it okay,” Komarechka tells PetaPixel. Arguably, it makes it less okay, and this is something Komarechka and many other photographers deal with constantly.\n\n“Professional photographers have the DMCA as a powerful tool,” he says. “Its effectiveness is somewhat diminished in countries outside of the United States, but thankfully most social media platforms and website hosting providers globally respect the nature of such requests. The frustrating part begins when the counterclaim process is misused, which very rarely happens. In the US, the Copyright Claims Board can handle such matters. In Canada, no such process exists. You either sue, or you let it go.”\n\n“In this instance, I allege that Mr. Kriger made false statements when the DMCA takedown notice was specifically identified as the thumbnail of the video. I have no authority over YouTube’s decision to remove the entire video rather than just the reported content.”\n\nDon Komarechka is frustrated that this particular situation became so personal and heated. Protecting his work is a continuous battle, but he is determined to continue fighting.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that Komarechka is well within his rights to enforce his copyright, it can simultaneously be true that someone who doesn’t understand copyright and used an image they found on Google without realizing the risk, can end up feeling scared or bullied.\n\nHowever, ignorance is not a viable legal defense, and does someone stealing his work without nefarious intent mean Komarechka should not protect himself? Where is the line?\n\nIn many cases, people are apologetic or did not realize they had misused an image. It reflects a broader misunderstanding about how images found online work. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the creators of those photos have ownership rights, which means they control an image’s license, and are well within their rights to defend that license as they see fit.\n\nKomarechka tells PetaPixel he does not intend to be the “bad guy,” but appreciates that consistently defending your copyright can make him appear like one. Given how people responded to Kriger’s post on Medium, Komarechka’s fears are well placed.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, and having read a lot of back and forth between the two parties, it is evident they both sincerely believe they are in the right. Kriger believes he has acted with grace and that Komarechka “chose escalation.”\n\nWhat counts as “escalation” is up for interpretation, but if issuing a copyright strike over stolen work is escalation, then artists have very few avenues available.\n\n“If this now proceeds to court, then so be it. But history — and anyone who reads this — will remember which of us extended a hand, and which of us chose to a raise a fist over a leaf,” Kriger concluded in what is, at this point, his final communication to Komarechka.\n\n“There are moral lines all over the place here. And there are legal ones,” Komarechka tells PetaPixel. “How are photographers to enforce their copyrights if the simplest tools like the DMCA takedown request can be so blatantly circumvented?”\n\nA major issue that Komarechka faces now is that Kriger filed a DMCA counterclaim on YouTube, which requires Komarechka file an injunction to contest the counterclaim. This is an expensive legal matter that Kriger believes does not make sense for Komarechka to do, putting Komarechka in an unenviable and frustrating situation. It is a strange, unfortunate legal stalemate that puts the onus on the claimant to spend time and money protecting their rights.\n\n“As such, your counterclaim is false,” Komarechka told Kriger over email. “You state that the DMCA takedown request is disproportionate, but in effect it’s legal and valid. All of the facts support this. However, YouTube doesn’t give me much room to fight you on this, other than by filing for an injunction. I have provided the documents and evidence to my attorney for review.”\n\n“I look at the facts and it’s really hard to do much about it when someone takes your work and makes statements that are automatically parsed by systems and not reviewed by individuals. The resulting actions from these automatic processes are extremely costly to the person whose copyright has been infringed,” Komarechka continues.\n\n“He could have simply walked away, no issues, but the crux of the matter is that he chose to file a legal counterclaim. Should I spend tens of thousands of dollars to file a lawsuit in federal court to obtain an injunction because he (allegedly) lied on a counterclaim notice? This is what we are up against. This is the problem.\n\n“It’s absolutely sad the lengths a creative needs to go to to protect their work,” the photographer adds.\n\nImage credits: The featured ‘Maple Leaf Flag’ image is by Don Komarechka and used with permission."}

The publications received international news coverage and enough chatter on social media platforms such as X and Bluesky to place them in the top 5 percent of all articles scored by Altmetric, a data company that tracks digital mentions of research.\n\nThe societies, led by the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society, represent clinicians who prescribe or perform the interventional spine procedures the guideline recommends against. The groups “have serious concerns about the methodology and conclusions drawn in these publications and their potential impact on patient care,” they wrote in a statement dated March 18, and summarized in a rapid response on the BMJ’s website. The statement has since been published in The Spine Journal and Interventional Pain Medicine.\n\nThe authors of the guideline and meta-analysis have stood by their work in responses to the critiques and comments to Retraction Watch. The BMJ “have no plans to take further action” beyond publishing the critiques and authors’ responses, Caroline White, a spokesperson for the journal, told us.\n\nThe systematic review included 132 previously published trials, of which 81 yielded data for the meta-analysis. The authors found “no commonly performed interventional procedure provided convincing evidence of important pain relief or improvement in physical functioning,” they wrote. “Indeed, in many instances the evidence showed moderate certainty of little to no effect.”\n\nAfter reviewing the findings, the guideline panel, which included some of the authors of the review, “concluded that all or almost all informed patients would choose to avoid interventional procedures” for chronic spine pain, they wrote, “because all low and moderate certainty evidence suggests little to no benefit on pain relief compared with sham procedures, and these procedures are burdensome and may result in adverse events.”\n\nThe guideline authors speculated “the substantial reimbursement associated with these procedures may act as a perverse incentive” for their use.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the articles, Jane C. Ballantyne of the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle noted some existing guidelines on the procedures recommended their use, while others recommended against them. Ballantyne, an anesthesiologist and pain medicine specialist, had served as a peer reviewer for the systematic review and meta-analysis before publication, according to The BMJ’s open review documents.\n\nThe new publications, she wrote: “will not be the last word on spine injections for chronic back pain, but it adds to a growing sense that chronic pain management needs a major rethink that is perhaps best achieved by a better balance of reimbursements between procedural and non-procedural chronic pain treatments.”\n\nThe radiology and pain medicine societies detailed several critiques of the work in their letter asking The BMJ to retract the guideline, “based on extensive clinical experience and a review of the evidence.” The meta-analysis inappropriately combined data from trials of different procedures in patients with different diagnoses and areas of spine pain, they wrote, which “allowed pooling of data at the expense of interpretable conclusions.”\n\nThe guideline, in turn, lumped together “disparate groups of patients, conditions, spinal regions, and procedures,” they wrote. “Conflating these groups in analysis is convenient but misguided; in guideline development, it is misleading and irresponsible.”\n\nThe guideline also drew on studies of techniques that are no longer used, left out studies the medical societies deemed important for supporting the benefit of the techniques, and inaccurately extracted data from another positive study, the statement claimed.\n\nJoshua Rittenberg, president of the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society, posted summaries of the letter on The BMJ’s website as rapid responses to the guideline and meta-analysis. He acknowledged the interventional procedures “are not universally effective,” but argued they could help “appropriately selected patients.” Rittenberg did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nIn responses to the critiques, Jason Busse of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and coauthors disputed the assertion the meta-analysis had included studies on procedures not commonly used in practice, and denied excluding any eligible trials. They also defended their method of pooling data, as subgroup analyses they conducted “found no evidence for systematic differences in treatment effects” for different spinal regions, procedure approaches, or conditions.\n\n“We are aware that our findings are disappointing to clinicians that administer interventional procedures for chronic spine pain, and have carefully considered all Rapid Responses submitted to the BMJ,” Busse and Liang Yao, the corresponding authors of the guideline and meta-analysis, respectively, wrote in comments to Retraction Watch.\n\n“If some clinicians believe that they can correctly identify patients with chronic spine pain who will benefit from interventional procedures, we believe they should undertake high quality sham-controlled trials to provide evidence,” they wrote. “As we note in our guideline, such evidence would alter our recommendations.”\n\nLike Retraction Watch?

I’m not ashamed to admit it", "fullContent": "I block every single ad on YouTube. And I’m a hypocrite for doing it. But I’m not ashamed. Because through a series of blunders and malicious decisions, Google has systematically made YouTube a worse and worse viewing experience, abusing its monopoly position as the de facto home of video on the web.\n\nI’m a hypocrite for blocking ads\n\nLet’s start off this rant with a little context. As a web writer, I should never block advertising on the internet. The majority of the money I’ve been paid over the last 13 years has come from web ads, like the ones you’re probably seeing above, below, and around these words. A modern writer for a free-to-read site blocking advertising is kind of like a vegan butcher: problematic at best.\n\nGoogle\n\nAdvertising is how the majority of content on the internet is sustainable. Google, Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn, TikTok, the social media service formerly known as Twitter — if you’re accessing information for free, it’s almost always being paid for by ads. Google isn’t a search company, it’s the biggest advertising company on the planet. And yes, that includes Google’s subsidiary services like Gmail, Google Docs, and YouTube.\n\nBut the fact that advertising is literally vital to the web doesn’t take away its problems. Modern web ads are targeted towards people with a shocking degree of specificity. Your advertising profile, curated and updated via tracking cookies, probably includes far more data than you’d feel comfortable with if you saw it.\n\nAds clutter up pages and obscure the content they’re supposed to be supporting, bogging down performance with unnecessary videos and animations. And that’s when they’re not being actively malicious, spreading malware or targeted disinformation, or just plain selling scams. Google officially tries to police what gets advertised with its systems, as do other advertising giants, but this largely automated system has built-in holes that are constantly leaking the stuff of nightmares.\n\nSo yeah, I use an ad blocker in my browser, hypocritical as it is for me. And I don’t blame anyone else for doing it, either. It’s become an essential tool for any user of modern technology.\n\nI manually turn on my ad blocker only for the most annoying and obtrusive ads. So I’m only mostly a hypocrite. Michael Crider/Foundry\n\nTo hold on to a shred of dignity, I don’t block all ads. I use a “reverse allowlist,” only manually blocking ads on websites that bog down my PC with a glut of performance-sapping videos and animations, and only when I don’t have an alternative. As someone who works online and keeps dozens of tabs and windows open concurrently, I really don’t have an option not to block a lot of ads, even on my beefy desktop with 32GB of memory. The reverse allowlist feature is one of the reasons I recommend AdGuard over more popular alternatives like AdBlock Plus.\n\nBased on that criteria, I shouldn’t block ads on YouTube. They don’t sap performance (much), and as annoying as they are, they pay for the content I watch for free. Open and shut case, right?\n\nGoogle makes YouTube worse so you’ll pay to undo it\n\nWrong. Over the last few years Google has abused YouTube, its viewers, and its creators at every opportunity, and I’m sick of it. And since YouTube is an effective monopoly on the web (and hardly the only one Google is abusing), I feel zero shame about skirting around its attempts to make me pay for it with either dollars or attention. Vive la resistance.\n\nYears ago I watched ads on YouTube, patiently waiting for the “skip” button to appear, gritting my teeth as that took longer and longer. I first considered blocking them when I started getting unskippable 30-second advertisements in front of movie trailers posted by Hollywood studios — ads to watch ads, in a twisted mirror of bloated theater previews. But the final straw was when Google began showing two ads at once before pretty much every video.\n\nTired of seeing political ads on YouTube that literally instruct you to be afraid? Too freakin’ bad. Michael Crider/Foundry\n\nAs it happens, I started seeing double the advertising at exactly the same time that YouTube Premium became an option in 2018. Of course that wasn’t a coincidence. Google decided to make the experience of YouTube materially worse at the same time that it introduced a paid option to make it better.\n\nWe’ve seen the same thing happen with most of the mainstream video platforms: a cheap, ad-supported tier appears, and suddenly the ad-free experience is “premium.” Amazon didn’t even try to hide it — they simply made everything on Prime Video ad-supported, and told everyone to pay up if they didn’t like it. Pay more, I should say, since Prime was already a paid service.\n\nArbitrarily making your service worse so you can pay to undo the malfeasance really gets my goat. I resolved to begin blocking every YouTube ad I could and never pay for it, simply out of spite. And I succeeded.\n\nHow I block every YouTube ad — even the ones YouTube doesn’t pay for\n\nOn the desktop the easiest way to go about this is with a standard ad-blocker. Again, I prefer AdGuard, which has generally been reliable for this purpose. And it works in pretty much every browser, including my new bestie Vivaldi.\n\nOnce you’ve made that jump, there are other ways to enhance your experience that Google probably wouldn’t appreciate. You can skip past repetitive channel intros and outros, even automatically jump past the paid sponsorships that channels are forced to use when YouTube doesn’t pay them enough (the ads upon ads upon ads). The promo page for SponsorBlock says the extension has auto-skipped over thousands of years of integrated ads for its users.\n\nGoogle\n\nBut that’s just the desktop. What about mobile, where most of the world is actually watching YouTube? On Android this is fairly easy, if not straightforward. You can use a tool like ReVanced to patch the official app, baking those ad-blocking tools right into a customized version. In addition to blocking ads and skipping sponsored segments, it can even unlock the features that Google has placed behind the Premium adwall, like the ability to play audio in the background while you use other apps or have your phone off entirely.\n\nThe ReVanced tool, which can patch the official YouTube Android app, makes the service bearable again. Michael Crider/Foundry\n\nIn the interest of total transparency: This is something Google would probably call stealing, and it’s definitely against YouTube’s terms of service. Which is why they fight so hard against these apps.\n\nAre you using an iPhone instead of Android, or aren’t keen on the slightly daunting task of messing with the official app? Then there are other options. You can view YouTube through a mobile browser like DuckDuckGo for easy access to ad-blocking and background audio. There are even a few apps like PopTube that are essentially third-party YouTube clients, doing their best to get around Google’s restrictions.\n\nIf all else fails, you can use a VPN to pretend you’re in a country where Google doesn’t think it’s worth it to run ads. And because I still need to earn a paycheck, here are some VPNs you might consider. As it happens, the VPN service I pay for every month is cheaper every month than a YouTube Premium subscription.\n\nPlaying cat and mouse with Google\n\nGoogle is doing its best to get around these methods as they become more popular. The keeper of the keys has been experimenting with a lot of ways to make sure you’re either paying or watching ads — the original “Vanced” app had to shut down for fear of legal repercussions. Google has slowed down the performance of YouTube for users who are blocking ads, trying to make it as frustrating as possible. And every time, the ad blockers have won out. Because YouTube might be powered by money, but ad-blocking developers are powered by spite.\n\nGoogle’s next attempt to out-fox ad-blockers is baking advertising right into the base of the video stream, encoding the ads into the same file as the video itself. This is a huge technical overhead, something that will put some serious strain on YouTube’s data centers. And I don’t think it’ll work, even if they get it functional. The ability to bypass sponsored ads hard-coded into the videos already exists, and shows up within a few hours of a new video being posted on a popular channel.\n\nIf all this seems like a lot just to skip out on $15 a month, well, I suppose it is. Especially since I watch far more YouTube than I do any streaming service I actually pay for. But I’m not the only one who’s fed up with the platform, and sadly has no real alternative. YouTube’s own creators are sick of it too.\n\nEven YouTube creators are sick of YouTube\n\nYou can’t watch any professional YouTube channel for long without hearing about videos getting taken down for overzealous and questionably legal copyright claims, as the automated systems leave the actual enforcement of fair use to humans. There are also elaborate methods of flagging videos with copyright notices and, instead of removing the video, simply leaving it in place and taking (or stealing) the revenue it creates. This is a system designed to end YouTube’s freewheeling pre-Google days as an open haven for piracy, but now it’s been weaponized as a way for gigantic corporations to fleece genuine creators out of the fruits of their labor.\n\nAnd that’s assuming that advertisers are willing to pay for it in the first place. YouTube’s demonetization system, by which Google simply refuses to pay a creator because advertisers don’t want to be associated with controversial topics, is just as big a menace for anyone actually trying to make a living on the platform. You’ll see creators censor their own speech to avoid swearing too early, or using ridiculous euphemisms like “unalive” for kill or “self-delete” for suicide, topics that appear next to highly paid advertising on television every single day.\n\nThe following (demonetized) video has lots and lots of swearing. Fair warning. See how easy that was?\n\nTry to make a video about true crime without saying “murder,” and you’ll see why YouTube creators are always begging you to subscribe to them on Patreon. Because it’s becoming harder and harder to actually make money on YouTube…and there’s no one to blame for that, except YouTube.\n\nAnd for what? When I use YouTube in another browser or with extensions disabled, I still see some of the same trash ads I used to. Blatant “training methods” for get-rich-quick scams, the same kind of garbage that was stealing people’s money on late night TV thirty years ago. Mobile game ripoffs straight-up lying about what their actual gameplay looks like. “Dating ads” with Photoshopped models that seem like they’re either fake or victims of human trafficking. And just recently, endless, endless political ads with zero standards for either production or truth.\n\nI even get advertising for ad blockers. So Google is accepting money to advertise products on YouTube…that it absolutely forbids you to use on YouTube, according to its Terms of Service. YouTube seems to have much lower standards for the people buying ads it than for the people who make the content that enables those ads to function.\n\nDropout.tv\n\nTo try and alleviate my conscience, I do pay for some of the content I watch. Indeed, I use Patreon to support some of my favorite channels like Drawfee and Second Wind. The YouTube monopoly is the only way they can actually get their content seen and I don’t want them to disappear. I’ve bought D&D merchandise from creators like Pointy Hat when they advertise their own stuff, just as a means of showing my appreciation. And I’m subscribed to the comedy channel Dropout, which evolved out of College Humor, and has become possibly the only self-sustaining streaming service that’s actually worth what it charges.\n\nBut pay for YouTube directly? Not a chance. I’ve given Google too much money for phones and tablets in the past, I paid for Google Play Music for years before they once again scrapped it for a worse and more expensive service. Until Google starts respecting both the users that it serves and the creators that it depends upon, it doesn’t get any more of my cash.\n\nEditor’s note: This editorial originally published in November 2024, but was updated after YouTube rolled out the $8 Premium Lite subscription to include reference in the relevant section."}
