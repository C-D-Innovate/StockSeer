But something's missing and scientists are confused", "fullContent": "Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is the only body beyond Earth known to host stable bodies of liquid on its surface.\n\nScientists have known for a while that Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has rivers and seas of liquid methane on its surface. But it's strangely lacking in deltas, a new study suggests.\n\nOn Earth, large rivers create deltas with sediment-filled wetlands. Deltas form when the mouth of a river empties into another body of water. Besides Earth, Titan is the only planetary body in our solar system with liquid flowing on the surface.\n\nResearchers recently looked for deltas on the big Saturn satellite but came up empty.\n\n\"We take it for granted that if you have rivers and sediments, you get deltas,\" study leader Sam Birch, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown University in Rhode Island, said in a statement .\n\n\"But Titan is weird. It's a playground for studying processes we thought we understood,\" he added.\n\nRelated: Space photo of the week: Look into Titan's 'eye,' 20 years after the Huygens spacecraft's historic landing on Saturn's largest moon\n\nThe researchers were hoping to find deltas on Titan, because these landforms feature lots of sediment. The sediment in deltas tends to come from a large area, and deltas gather it in one place. Studying such sediment could reveal insights about Titan's climate and tectonic histories — and perhaps even possible signs of alien life.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Cassini used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to look through Titan's thick atmosphere during these close encounters and found channels and large flat areas that are consistent with large bodies of liquid.\n\nBut shallow liquid methane is largely transparent in Cassini's SAR data. Scientists have therefore had a hard time studying Titan's coastal features, because it's hard to make out where the coast ends and the sea floor starts.\n\nSo, Birch's team came up with a computer model that simulates what Cassini's SAR would see when looking at Earth . But the model replaced the water in Earth's rivers and oceans with Titan's liquid methane.\n\n\"We basically made synthetic SAR images of Earth that assume properties of Titan's liquid instead of Earth's,\" Birch said. \"Once we see SAR images of a landscape we know very well, we can go back to Titan and understand a bit better what we're looking at.\"\n\nEarth as seen by the radar instrument on NASA's Cassini Saturn probe. In order to understand what landforms on Titan could be seen by Cassini's radar, researchers looked at well-known Earth landforms through Cassini's perspective. The bottom image is how the U.S. Gulf Coast would have looked to Cassini. (Image credit: Birch Lab/Brown University)\n\nThe synthetic SAR images of Earth that they created \"resolved large deltas and many other large coastal landscapes,\" according to the researchers.\n\nThey say that new analysis of the Cassini SAR data also revealed other mysteries. For example, Titan's coasts appear to have pits of unknown origin deep within lakes and seas, and deep channels cut across the moon's sea floors offer no clue to how they got there.\n\n\"This is really not what we expected,\" Birch said. \"But Titan does this to us a lot. I think that's what makes it such an engaging place to study.\"\n\nThe new study was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets on March 25."}

To nourish her longing, she undertook the study of Iran’s social history. In 1999 she earned her doctorate in Middle East history, jointly awarded by the University of Utah and London School of Economics (where she had completed her degree in the 1960s) under the supervision of Ernest Gellner. Her thesis, a study of one of her ancestors, Haj Muhammad Amin al-Zarb, a 19th-century Persian merchant, was published in 2018 under the title For God, Mammon and Country.\n\nBorn in Tehran, to Ebrahim Mahdavi, a civil servant, and Nayer (nee Diba), Shireen had two younger sisters, Leila and Simin. Ebrahim was western-educated, and so the girls were all sent to the UK for secondary schooling.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nShireen was 12 and spoke no English when her father dropped her off at Highgate school in London as a boarder. Her father had met the British architect Jane Drew on the flight home, and she purportedly told him: “I’ll look in on her.” My mother said that one day as she was sitting in the library of the school, there was a racket of clicking heels and jangling bracelets, as a statuesque Drew descended the staircase into the library and told her that going forward she would be her guardian. Shireen spent weekends and holidays at the home of Drew, her husband, Maxwell Fry, and their children, where she encountered many prominent artists and thinkers.\n\nAt LSE, she studied social anthropology. In 1960 she married an Iranian architect, Reza Khazeni, and, following her graduation in 1961, the couple moved back to Tehran.\n\nInitially, Shireen taught at the city’s Institute of Social Studies and Research, but from 1963 she began working as a researcher at the Iranian government’s Plan and Budget Organisation, primarily in the field of women’s rights, which led to the founding of the Women’s Organisation of Iran. Towards the end of her time there, before the 1979 revolution, she was responsible for assisting foreigners living in the country, guiding them through legal and social situations.\n\nFollowing the revolution, the family emigrated to Salt Lake City, Utah, where Reza had completed architecture school. Shireen embraced this new chapter in her life with zeal, raising their three small children while Reza ran an employment business.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nShireen returned to education in the 1980s. After finishing her doctorate, she taught at the University of Utah, and published many articles, including on the position of women in Iran.\n\nA diligent correspondent throughout her life, she stayed in touch with friends she had known as a child in Iran, those in Britain, and others throughout the world.\n\nHer son, Reza Ali, predeceased her, as did her sister Leila.

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nIt wasn't long ago that consultants at McKinsey & Company would pore over reports to ensure they aligned with the firm's writing style.\n\nNow, an AI agent called \"Tone of Voice\" does that.\n\nAt Boston Consulting Group, consultants now use a tool called Deckster to reduce the time they spend polishing PowerPoint slides. At Ernst & Young, instead of contacting payroll, consultants can ask a chatbot to explain their pay slips.\n\nConsulting firms are among the early leaders of the generative AI craze. They're helping other companies train employees, develop new tools, and regulate the technology.\n\nThey are also testing generative AI internally, and in just the past two years, they've unveiled a new suite of chatbots, agents, and applications that have quickly and quietly changed how consultants do their work.\n\nMcKinsey has embraced ChatGPT's conversational approach\n\nAt McKinsey, consultants are using an in-house generative AI chatbot called Lilli. It synthesizes the firm's entire body of intellectual property, which spans 100 years and over 100,000 documents and interviews, the firm told BI.\n\nUsers enter their requests into Lilli, which aggregates the key points, identifies five to seven relevant internal content pieces, and points users to appropriate experts within the firm. Users can opt to have queries answered by the firm's internal knowledge repository or external sources.\n\nLilli's usage at the firm has exploded since it was first rolled out in 2023. Over 70% of the firm's 45,000 employees now use the tool. Those who use it turn to it about 17 times a week, McKinsey senior partner Delphine Zurkiya told BI.\n\nWhen McKinsey first launched Lilli, employees experienced what the firm calls \"prompt anxiety,\" or uncertainty over what to ask the bot. But it found that just one hour of training improved employee engagement. Zurkiya said the tool has also evolved since its launch. It wasn't initially designed to parse PowerPoints, where most of the firm's knowledge exists.\n\nNow, McKinsey consultants told BI they use it for research, summarizing documents, analyzing data, and brainstorming. In a case study published on its website, the firm reported that workers saved 30% of their time using Lilli.\n\nZurkiya, who describes herself as \"one of the heavy users of Lilli,\" said she often uses it with teams to identify the right approach to solving client problems. \"We almost have AI in the room with us because we are often saying, oh, what does Lilli think,\" she said.\n\nPartners at McKinsey told BI that the firm has been developing AI products for years. In 2015, it acquired a data analytics and design company, QuantumBlack, which now serves as McKinsey's AI consulting arm. The firm employs 7,000 tech experts across 50 countries.\n\n\"About 40% of the work we do is analytics-related, AI-related, and a lot of it is moving to Gen AI,\" senior partner Ben Ellencweig told BI last year. McKinsey builds generative AI solutions for clients through an \"ecosystem\" of alliances with 19 AI companies, including Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, and Nvidia, and has completed over 400 genAI projects for clients.\n\nBut the popularity of ChatGPT crystallized the value of a conversational tool, Zurkiya said. \"There wasn't a major shift in our strategy in the sense that we had already been developing a lot of tools internally. It's just these tools now have become, we'll say faster, in delivering value thanks to that natural user interface,\" she said.\n\nMcKinsey consultants have access to ChatGPT with guardrails and cannot input client data into it.\n\nLilli is just one of several AI tools changing work within the firm. Zurkiya said that AI technology is being deployed at three levels. On an individual level, a platform lets consultants build their own AI agents — technology that, among other things, can solve problems and execute tasks autonomously. Then, there are more domain-specific tools. Agents in the Life Sciences practice, where Zurkiya works, can help consultants get up to speed on specific companies in the sector. There are also firm-wide tools, like new ones for booking meetings and travel.\n\nThe firm also applies the lessons from building Lilli to new client projects, developing similar tools that fit their needs.\n\nDespite the hype around genAI tools, consultants don't seem worried that their jobs could be threatened as a result. Commentators on the anonymous professional networking app Fishbowl who work at McKinsey described its tools as \"functional enough\" and best for \"very low stakes issues.\"\n\nBCG wants AI to 'increase the joy' in work\n\nOver the last two years, BCG has pushed to train its employees in AI.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nIn 2023, the firm unveiled ChatGPT Enterprise to all its employees under the stipulation that all data would remain under its control. Since then, the firm's 33,000 employees have built over 18,000 custom GPTs — tailored versions of ChatGPT — for internal uses from summarizing documents to generating automatic email responses to answering HR-specific questions.\n\nBCG has also developed eight or nine internal generative AI tools, Scott Wilder, partner and managing director, told BI.\n\nOne tool it has heavily invested in is Deckster, a slideshow editor, Wilder said. It's trained on 800 to 900 slide templates and helps consultants quickly create presentations. Wilder said one of Deckster's most popular features is a \"review this\" button, which helps junior consultants by grading slides based on best practices used by midlevel managers and leaders. About 40% of associates use Deckster weekly, Wilder said.\n\nThe tool has become so popular that some of its consultants are fretting about job security. \"BCG folks who've tried Deckster: how worried should we be about our jobs? Is it already creating groundbreaking productivity that more junior folks won't be needed as much?\" one consultant wrote on Fishbowl last year.\n\nOne of the more experimental tools BCG has unveiled is GENE, a conversational chatbot. The bot is built on top of GPT-4o by ElevenLabs and sports an intentionally robotic voice.\n\n\"It's a deliberate choice, a subtle reminder that I'm an AI, not a human. Keeps expectations in check,\" GENE said about its voice during a BCG podcast in December 2023. \"Plus it adds a bit of retro charm, doesn't it?\"\n\nGENE also explained that its knowledge base is \"built from an extensive collection of BCG's best thinking on genAI, shaped by conversations with industry experts, articles, and research studies.\"\n\nThe bot is designed to be a \"conversation partner,\" the firm said. Consultants have employed it for brainstorming, hosting podcasts, live demonstrations, and are even considering using it to interview partners to create content for the firm. Teams can change the bot's \"temperature\" to control the tone of its responses.\n\nBCG also has an internal platform for building AI agents in beta testing.\n\nAmid gloomy narratives of layoffs and robots coming for jobs, Wilder said the firm's thesis on AI is optimistic. \"We will say our goal is to take out the toil and increase the joy,\" he said. The firm estimates that employees reinvest about 70% of the time they save into \"higher value activities,\" he added.\n\nBut those time savings also mean the expectations on consultants are in flux. BCG hasn't changed how it evaluates performance now that it relies so much on genAI tools. However, a spokesperson for the firm told BI it is \"thoughtfully considering the role they play as these technologies become more central to how we work.\"\n\nDeloitte, KPMG, and PwC see promise in AI agents\n\nAt Deloitte, generative AI appears to be more tightly regulated. For one, ChatGPT is blocked from the firm's internal system, three consultants told BI.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n\"I think probably what they really are trying to avoid here is analysts or just forgetful people putting something like client data into a generative AI tool,\" Andrew Sutton, a senior advisory consultant at the firm, told BI. Sutton, who builds internal AI tools for other consultants at the firm, said they're required to develop them in secure environments to prevent data leaks.\n\n\"If we are using a tool that comes from something like OpenAI, we have special communications and contracts with them,\" he said. \"The amount of bureaucracy, all that stuff, that we have to go through is insane.\"\n\nThe firm has its own ChatGPT alternative called Sidekick, which comes with a disclaimer that employees are only allowed to use it for non-client work. Deloitte consultants told BI they use it for summarizing documents, brainstorming, editing emails, and coding.\n\nDeloitte has invested billions into artificial intelligence, however. In March, it unveiled Zora AI, a new fleet of AI agents. The firm says they're trained in specific subjects — like finance or marketing — and designed to think like humans. Last year, it expanded its digital delivery platform, Ascend, with generative AI capabilities.\n\nPublicly, the firm's leadership has also rallied around the technology. At Nvidia's GTC Conference in March, Deloitte principal Jillian Wanner, who leads AI staff development at the firm, acknowledged that the consulting industry is being \"disrupted\" amid AI transformations. Jim Rowan, head of AI at Deloitte, previously told BI that senior managers should use AI to demonstrate its effectiveness and give employees time to explore the technology.\n\nIn a recent statement to BI, Rowan said, \"We believe AI is transforming all industries, including our own, ushering in new business models and ways of working, and helping to uncover new sources of business growth and innovation.\"\n\nKPMG is taking two-pronged approach to AI adoption, according to its head of ecosystems, Todd Lohr. \"I'm a big fan of top down and bottoms up,\" Lohr told BI. \"It's really hard to know what hundreds of thousands of people in an organization are doing day to day. But by giving them the technology and letting them use it, they're coming up with even better and more creative ways than any top down methodology.\"\n\nHe said people were a bit confused about how to use genAI when the firm started rolling out the technology two years ago.\n\n\"I call it swivel chair processing. It's really hard for people who have been doing tasks for — in some cases — decades to stop what they're doing,\" Lohr said. Since then, the firm has harvested data on how employees are prompting AI. It's used that information to build new tools, for itself and clients, through retrieval augmented generation — a technique to enhance the specificity and accuracy of large language models — and open data sources, Lohr said.\n\nAs consulting firms develop more sophisticating tooling, like platforms for agents, they've realized they need hubs to centralize them. KPMG signed an agreement with Google Cloud this month to purchase licenses for Agentspace — a new platform that integrates AI agents with a company's data — for its US workforce.\n\nDeloitte recently started to support Agent2Agent, a new platform to improve interoperability between agents. It's the firm's largest collaboration with Google Cloud and ServiceNow.\n\nPwC unveiled a similar platform, called agent OS, last month. It helps centralize clients' agents, and the more than 250 internal ones it has built in the past 18 months. The idea is to convert isolated agents from \"ships passing in the night\" to \"an armada that's working together,\" Matt Wood, PwC's global and US commercial technology and innovation officer, told BI.\n\nAfter a post-pandemic dry spell in which many consulting firms struggled with layoffs, lost contracts, and cost-cutting initiatives, generative AI is something of a light at the end of the tunnel — even with the latest scrutiny from Washington.\n\n\"My bet is that as more agents become available, organizations will see not just efficiency, but growth,\" Wood said. \"And that growth will allow them to double down on what is working and will result in larger organizations, not smaller organizations.\""}

Waves of takedown notices, many filed by members of the public and various businesses, shine an unflattering light on the human condition. Whether hiding the truth, gagging rivals and critics, or simply telling tales; takedown notices sent by the public put us all at risk.\n\nEven after years of trawling the invaluable Lumen Database, the scale of online copyright infringement today still manages to surprise week after week. And with more time spent searching, the greater the chances of the archive surfacing curiosities from years ago, or unusual items from the more recent past.\n\nTake the bait and time has a tendency to get eaten away in journeys down various rabbit holes, and that’s a good thing. Without Lumen, censorship would undoubtedly thrive in a darker place; it already needs little encouragement.\n\nFree* Speech (*Terms and conditions apply, YMMV)\n\nAfter a spurious attempt to deindex one of our articles with a bogus copyright claim, research led us by chance down a parallel path, revealing an even greater threat to free speech and legitimate reporting.\n\nThe nature of a sizeable number of the takedown notices in question brings to mind the Lumen Database’s original name, Chilling Effects. The name was derived from the likely suppressant effect of abusive takedown notices and legal threats on free speech.\n\nIn the United States, where speaking the truth doesn’t usually amount to a crime, the scope of free speech far exceeds that available in Europe. In the Netherlands, for example, libel is a criminal offense and in the UK, the rich can launch libel action in the High Court. There, regular people can be drawn into a potentially ruinous legal quagmire, for as little as vigorously opposing one man’s assertion that his online handle is Satoshi.\n\nThreats to Google: Censor the Govt, BBC, Guardian, Daily Mail\n\nWorking for the BBC, Guardian, or Daily Mail can provide a safety net against the potential consequences of legal threats, but immunity from receiving threats themselves doesn’t exist. In a notice addressed to Google, the company was ordered to “De-index the specified URLs” from search results within 14 days to “prevent further dissemination” of what is described as “defamatory and harmful content.”​\n\n14 Days to Police The Internet\n\nPublished in 2022, the BBC URLs above report the details of a damning investigation involving serious neglect and abuse of children. The ‘Hansard’ URLs link to the website of the Houses of Parliament which contains transcripts of government ministers discussing the scandal. The name of the sender is redacted, but Google was threatened with an injunction and damages for simply having those links in its indexes.\n\nBusiness Disputes: He Said, She Said\n\nAnother notice demands a takedown based on the Defamation Act 2013, claiming that “the publication of a statement that would cause serious harm to the reputation of a person or entity” meets the criteria for defamation. The article in question was published by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, warning the public against doing business with a named fraudulent company.\n\nTakedown notices involving businesses and a maze of disputes related to the pursuit or recovery of money, are sent to Google in large numbers. Many involve allegations or denials of fraud. Some deny fraud despite documented evidence to the contrary. Others resort to vague copyright claims or indeed, anything else that might help silence the opposition. Whatever the mechanism, the legal threats persist.\n\nAll notices referenced here are listed under the same sender ID in the Lumen Database. Some have a similar format or likely common sender, others appear to be written by unconnected individuals. Some are barely understandable, others fail to identify what should be taken down; a surprising number contain no information, period.\n\nWho’s Telling the Truth? Friendly Sender or Something Else?\n\nConsidering how many takedown notices Google receives, it does a remarkable job of getting most things right. The reality is that it can’t check every complaint or validate every backstory.\n\nThe notice below appears to be someone being a good citizen, and we definitely need more of those. On the other hand, could it be a ruse to prompt Google into taking action against the Google Drive account listed in the takedown notice? We could test out the link, but taking unnecessary risks in this climate would be pretty stupid.\n\nThe next two complaints request TikTok-related takedowns. How Google was supposed to know what was said, or who did what, let alone who’s telling the truth, is unclear. The first notice sender, who seems oblivious to the inherent difficulties, may not have given it much thought. The second knows fraud when they see it, and a bit about the legality of copyright too.\n\nConcerned Citizens\n\nIf the takedown notice below is in some way official, presumably other avenues exist to ensure adherence to the regulations rather than de-indexing a business. The sender may be someone concerned about harmony in the trade or, at least potentially, someone with nothing better to do. In any event, it’s more work for Google.\n\nWhile it’s easy to sympathize with the position some senders claim to find themselves in, deleting links to news articles isn’t going to help. An article published by a UK news website reported how a drunken family member terrified another with a knife, before battering them over the head with a radio. At the local school, the news was blamed for creating unwanted friction.\n\n“This has gone to [sic] far and is causing grievances left right and center. I would like this delisted at the least from when you enter ‘[REDACTED] [REDACTED]’ into Google search bar,” the sender insisted.\n\nA rambling notice reportedly sent by a person convicted of a serious crime, demanded the removal of an article reporting their sentencing. Active on social media now, having learned nothing, this matter can only be referred directly to the police.\n\nInternet Dispute Court: Judge Google Presiding\n\nFrom complaints about students using an AI service to write their assignments, to an insistence that content must be deindexed because the author “is from Estonia for God’s sake,” Google has much on its plate, including social media squabbles to preside over. Requests to remove links to Facebook pages, accounts on X, and listings on Temu, are seen as problems to be solved by silencing those who didn’t send a complaint.\n\nOne notice argued that a news story about a sportsman’s wife, who discovered that her husband was also married to someone else, should be removed because it amounts to defamation of the wife’s character.\n\nGoogle also receives many takedown notices for photos uploaded to Google Maps. A cursory review of a few suggest that some images taken inside various restaurants may not have met the standard their owners’ expected.\n\nOther notices seem to have good intentions, but appear to use drama to improve takedown odds. In one example, a potential map error becomes a hazard to public safety fueled by potential fraud and deception.\n\nUnjustified Takedowns Remain Unacceptable (usually)\n\nCopyright-related takedowns have their moments but from the few hundred reviewed for the above, takedowns for other reasons represent a far greater risk to the public record and associated freedom of speech.\n\nUnder the DSA, large platforms including Google are required to inform the European Commission when and why content was taken down. The scheme was available late 2023, the number of takedowns reported today is significant.\n\nTo end on a lighter note, takedowns that put the well-being of others before selfish interests, are a pleasure to read and immediately restore all faith in human nature."}

Photos of her face had been taken from social media and edited onto naked bodies, shared with dozens of users in a chat room on the messaging app Telegram.\n\nThe comments in screen shots of the chat room were demeaning and vulgar – as were the texts from the anonymous messenger who had sent her the images. “Isn’t it funny? … Watching your own sex video,” they wrote. “Tell me you honestly enjoy this.”\n\nThe harassment escalated into threats to share the images more widely and taunts that police wouldn’t be able to find the perpetrators. The sender seemed to know her personal details, but she had no way to identify them.\n\n“I was bombarded with all these images that I had never imagined in my life,” said Ruma, who CNN is identifying with a pseudonym for her privacy and safety.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, photos of Ruma's face were taken from social media and edited onto naked bodies. The animated video includes some of the messages she received from the perpetrator. CNN\n\nWhile revenge porn – the nonconsensual sharing of sexual images – has been around for nearly as long as the internet, the proliferation of AI tools means that anyone can be targeted by explicit deepfakes, even if they’ve never taken or sent a nude photo.\n\nSouth Korea has had a particularly fraught recent history of digital sex crimes, from hidden cameras in public facilities to Telegram chat rooms where women and girls were coerced and blackmailed into posting demeaning sexual content.\n\nBut deepfake technology is now posing a new threat, and the crisis is particularly acute in schools. Between January and early November last year, more than 900 students, teachers and staff in schools reported that they fell victim to deepfake sex crimes, according to data from the country’s education ministry. Those figures do not include universities, which have also seen a spate of deepfake porn attacks.\n\nIn response, the ministry established an emergency task force. And in September, legislators passed an amendment that made possessing and viewing deepfake porn punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine of up to 30 million won (over $20,000).\n\nCreating and distributing non-consensual deepfake explicit images now has a maximum prison sentence of seven years, up from five.\n\nSouth Korea’s National Police Agency has urged its officers to “take the lead in completely eradicating deepfake sex crimes.”\n\nBut of 964 deepfake-related sex crime cases reported from January to October last year, police made 23 arrests, according to a Seoul National Police statement.\n\nLegislator Kim Nam-hee told CNN that “investigations and punishments have been too passive so far.” So, some victims, like Ruma, are conducting their own investigations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Victim of AI-generated revenge porn tells CNN incident changed her ‘whole personality’ 03:55 - Source: CNN Victim of AI-generated revenge porn tells CNN incident changed her ‘whole personality’ 03:55\n\nVictims taking action\n\nRuma was a 27-year-old university student when her nightmare first began. When she went to the police, they told her they would request user information from Telegram, but warned the platform was notorious for not sharing such data, she said.\n\nOnce an outgoing student who enjoyed school and an active social life, Ruma said the incident had completely changed her life.\n\n“It broke my whole belief system about the world,” she said. “The fact that they could use such vulgar, rough images to humiliate and violate you to that extreme extent really damages you almost irrevocably.”\n\nShe decided to act after learning that investigations into reports by other students had ended after a few months, with police citing difficulty in identifying suspects.\n\nWon Eun-ji, an activist and journalist known for exposing South Korea’s then largest Telegram chat room case in 2020, says society still lacks understanding of how serious this crime is. Charles Miller/CNN\n\nRuma and fellow students sought help from Won Eun-ji, an activist who gained national fame for exposing South Korea’s largest digital sex crime group on Telegram in 2020.\n\nWon agreed to help, creating a fake Telegram account and posing as a man in his 30s to infiltrate the chat room where the deepfake images had circulated. She spent nearly two years carefully gathering information and engaging other users in conversation, before coordinating with police to help carry out a sting operation.\n\nWhen police confronted the suspect, Won sent him a Telegram message. His phone pinged – he had been caught.\n\nTwo former students from the prestigious Seoul National University (SNU) were arrested last May. The main perpetrator was ultimately sentenced to 9 years in prison for producing and distributing sexually exploitative materials, while an accomplice was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison.\n\nPolice told CNN further investigations identified at least 61 victims, including 12 current and former SNU students. Seoul National University, in a briefing after the incident, said “the school will strengthen preventative education to raise awareness among the members of the university about digital sex crimes and do its best to protect victims and prevent recurrence.”\n\nExcerpts of the ruling shared by Ruma’s lawyers state, “The fake explicit materials produced by the perpetrator are repugnant, and the conversations surrounding them are shocking … They targeted victims as if they were hunting prey, sexually insulted the victims and destroyed their dignity by using photos from graduations, weddings, and family gatherings.”\n\nIn response to the verdict, Ruma told CNN, “I didn’t expect the ruling to align exactly with the prosecution’s request. I’m happy, but this is only the first trial. I don’t feel entirely relieved yet.”\n\nRuma’s case is just one of thousands across South Korea – and some victims had less help from police.\n\nA high school teacher Kim, who CNN is identifying by her last name only for privacy and safety, says her experience changed her life forever. Yoonjung Seo/CNN\n\nPublic often unsympathetic\n\nOne high school teacher, Kim, told CNN she first learned she was being targeted for exploitation in July 2023, when a student urgently showed her Twitter screenshots of inappropriate photos taken of her in the classroom, focusing on her body.\n\n“My hands started to shake,” she recalled. “When could this photo have been taken, and who would upload such a thing?”\n\nCNN is identifying Kim by her last name only for her privacy and safety.\n\nBut she said the situation worsened two days later. Her hair was made messy, and her body was altered to make it look like she was looking back. The manipulated picture of her face was added onto nude photos. The sophisticated technology made the images unnervingly realistic.\n\nPolice told her that their only option to identify the poster was to request user information from Twitter, the social media platform bought by Elon Musk in 2022 and rebranded as X in 2023, with an emphasis on free speech and privacy.\n\nKim and a colleague, also a victim of a secret filming, feared that using official channels to identify the user would take too long and launched their own investigation.\n\nThey identified the person: a quiet, introverted student “someone you’d never imagine doing such a thing,” Kim said.\n\nThe person was charged but regardless of what happens in court, she said life will never be the same.\n\nShe said a lack of public empathy has frustrated her too. “I read a lot of articles and comments about deepfakes saying, ‘Why is it a serious crime when it’s not even your real body?’” Kim said.\n\nAccording to X’s current policy, obtaining user information involves obtaining a subpoena, court order, or other valid legal document and submitting a request on law enforcement letterhead via its website.\n\nX says it’s company policy to inform users that a request has been made.\n\nIts rules on authenticity state that users “may not share inauthentic content on X that may deceive people or lead to harm.”\n\nPressure on social platforms to act\n\nWon, the activist, said that for a long time, sharing and viewing sexual content of women was not considered a serious offense in South Korea.\n\nThough pornography is banned, authorities have long failed to enforce the law or punish offenders, Won said.\n\nSocietal apathy makes it easier for perpetrators to commit digital sex crimes, Won said, including what she called “acquaintance humiliation.”\n\n“Acquaintance humiliation” often begins with perpetrators sharing photos and personal information of women they know on Telegram, offering to create deepfake content or asking others to do so. Victims live in fear as attackers often know their personal information – where they live, work, and even details about their families – posing real threats to their safety and allowing anonymous users to harass women directly.\n\nSince South Korea’s largest digital sex exploitation case on Telegram in 2020, Won said the sexual exploitation ecosystem had fluctuated, shrinking during large-scale police investigations but expanding again once authorities ease off.\n\nThe victims CNN interviewed all pushed for heavier punishment for perpetrators. While prevention is important, “there’s a need to judge these cases properly when they occur,” Kim said.\n\nOnline platforms are also under pressure to act.\n\nTelegram, which has become a fertile space for various digital crimes, announced it would increase sharing user data with authorities as part of a broader crackdown on illegal activities.\n\nThe move came after the company’s CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in August in France on a warrant relating to Telegram’s lack of moderation, marking a turning point for a platform long recognized for its commitment to privacy and encrypted messaging. Durov is under formal investigation but has been allowed to leave France, he said in a post on Telegram.\n\nLast September, South Korea’s media regulator said Telegram had agreed to establish a hotline to help wipe illegal content from the app, and that the company had removed 148 digital sex crime videos as requested by the regulator.\n\n“This is something that has been delayed for far too long.” Won Eun-ji, Activist & Journalist\n\nWon welcomed this move, but with some skepticism – saying governments should remove the app from app stores, to prevent new users from signing up, if Telegram doesn’t show substantial progress soon. “This is something that has been delayed for far too long,” she said.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Telegram said the company “has a zero-tolerance policy for illegal pornography” and uses “a combination of human moderation, AI and machine learning tools and reports from users and trusted organizations to combat illegal pornography and other abuses of the platform.”\n\nA meaningful breakthrough occurred this January, marking the first time Korean authorities successfully obtained crime-related data from Telegram, according to Seoul police.\n\nFourteen people were arrested, including six minors, for allegedly sexually exploiting over 200 victims through Telegram. The criminal ring’s mastermind had allegedly targeted men and women of various ages since 2020, and more than 70 others were under investigation for allegedly creating and sharing deepfake exploitation materials, Seoul police said.\n\nMeanwhile, victims told CNN they hope other women in their position can receive more support from the police and the courts going forward.\n\n“No matter how much punishments are strengthened, there are still far more victims who suffer because their perpetrators have not been caught, and that’s why it feels like the verdict is still far from being a true realization of change or justice,” Ruma said. “There’s a long way to go.”"}

But what if it’s wrong?\n\nWhat if, before starting 13 billion years ago as a tiny ball of incomprehensibly hot gas exploding with unimaginable force and expanding eternally into an inexplicable nothingness, our universe evolved from another universe which in turn evolved from another?\n\nJulian Gough, the Irish author, playwright and one-time musician, has unveiled a cosmological theory he believes may better explain the origins of our universe than widely accepted theories.\n\nHe admits there will be blowback for the “blowtorch theory” published on his cosmology website The Egg and the Rock but is not fazed by the criticism that will come his way.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe author, who wrote the last chapter of Minecraft and whose novels have been published in 37 languages, has seen his website achieve a cult following driven by his successful prediction, before the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) sent back its first data in 2022, that it would observe extremely early, rapid galaxy formation, with those galaxies dominated by supermassive black holes.\n\nHis predictions saw many scientists actively helping him to develop the new theory and attracted funding from Emergent Ventures (run by the economist and polymath Tyler Cowen), and O’Shaughnessy Ventures (run by the venture capital investor, quant pioneer, and former board chair of Stability AI, Jim O’Shaughnessy).\n\nHis theory posits the idea that sustained, powerful jets from supermassive black holes in the extremely early universe “actively carved the large-scale structure of the universe we see all around us today, including galaxies, cosmic voids, and filament”.\n\nJulian Gough: The Irish author, playwright and one-time musician believes his 'blowtorch' theory may better explain the origins of our universe than widely accepted theories. Photograph: Alan Betson/The Irish Times\n\nHe said the JWST “has shaken the faith of many cosmologists, astronomers and astrophysicists in their models” adding that the telescope’s observations “are causing ongoing chaos and I’m the only guy who accurately predicted, at every stage, what it would see”.\n\nGough’s blowtorch theory and the evolutionary cosmology is, he suggested, “more exciting and attractive right now than the mainstream theory, ‘lambda cold dark matter’, which, after 50 years of constant tweaking, still didn’t see any of this coming”.\n\n[ James Webb telescope finds its first exoplanet, raising hopes it will discover life elsewhere in universeOpens in new window ]\n\nThe blowtorch theory “is a product of three-stage cosmological natural selection, or what we’re now starting to call evolutionary cosmology”, Gough said, that draws much from evolutionary biology and “has huge explanatory and predictive power when applied to our universe”.\n\nThe core idea is that our universe evolved, in the Darwinian sense, and that it’s descended from earlier, simpler universes, which reproduced through black holes.\n\n“Evolution has therefore fine tuned our particular universe to produce, first, some supermassive black holes, which then generate stars and thus galaxies around themselves, which generate many more secondary, star-sized black holes but also the periodic table of the elements, which generate planets, which generate life, which generates technology, which generates huge numbers of small, technologically produced third-stage black holes (for extremely efficient, sustainable, long-term energy production),” Gough said.\n\n“Each of these three evolved developmental steps helps the universe reproduce more efficiently, by generating more black holes – more offspring – from the same amount of matter.”\n\nHis conclusion is that “biology is the first half of the periodic table coming to life; technology is the second half of the periodic table coming to life in an evolved developmental process that helps the universe to reproduce”.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope whose observations have 'shaken the faith of many cosmologists, astronomers and astrophysicists in their models', says Julian Gough. Photograph: Nasa\n\nAccording to Gough, the mainstream approach “has always been, there is one universe, and everything that happens in it is random and arbitrary, and life is just this weird, unlikely accident”.\n\n“But that mainstream approach has great difficulty explaining the extremely rapid, efficient, step-by-step development of our universe since the big bang, from a ball of hot gas to the hyper-sophisticated world we live in. And, unfortunately for the status quo, predictions based on evolutionary cosmology now massively outperform predictions made using the old approach.”\n\nSome recent developments seem to be working in the theory’s favour. Late last month, Nasa reported that an international team of astronomers using the JWST “identified bright hydrogen emission from a galaxy in an unexpectedly early time in the universe’s history”.\n\n“The surprise finding is challenging researchers to explain how this light could have pierced the thick fog of neutral hydrogen that filled space at that time,” it said.\n\nGough said the findings could be explained by an “enormous jet from a supermassive black hole”.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. One Irish-based scientist dismissed Gough’s work out of hand: “This looks like crazy stuff to me and I wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole.” Others are far less dismissive.\n\nWe need a more open-minded dialogue between mainstream and unconventional lines of research to escape the dead end we manoeuvred ourselves into — Dr Jenny Wagner\n\nDr Jenny Wagner, a German cosmologist, physicist and author based at the Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Helsinki, told The Irish Times Gough has developed “an interesting idea”.\n\nShe noted that standard observational cosmology collects evidence to track the evolution of the cosmos from the first picture we have, which, she argued, goes from “the rather homogeneous and isotropic cosmic microwave background to the highly complex landscape it has become with all its galaxy clusters, galaxies, stars, and planets”.\n\nWagner said it was possible to “only observe and draw conclusions from the single universe we happen to live in. These are the huge drawbacks. It is like studying medicine on a single patient.”\n\nShe suggested the extremes of thinking were the anthropic principle, where “the universe is as it is because we are here to observe it, because we are special” and the “nihilistic answer that everything that is possible is actually created, so there should not be a single universe with fine-tuned conditions for life, but rather a multitude of universes (a multimultiverse) realising every possible scenario.\n\n“Between these extreme ends, the blowtorch theory assumes that there is an evolution of universes. Complexity increases with every step forward and builds upon the previous stage.”\n\nWagner said an “intriguing part of the blowtorch theory stays at the level of observationally testable predictions in our cosmos: it raises highly important questions on the validity of our current concordance model in cosmology. For instance, do we really need dark matter to explain our observations?\n\nThe Tarantula Nebula star-forming region which lies about 170,000 light years from Earth. Photograph: European Southern Observatory\n\nDark matter supposedly contributes 85 per cent of the total matter content of the universe. It is a single and elegant concept that can successfully explain many data sets from the cosmic microwave background to the non-linear structures we observe today.\n\n“However, after more than half a century of dark-matter research, all we have is indirect evidence. Cern and other experiments like DAMA/LIBRA, XENONnT or IceCube have not found any particle candidate.”\n\n[ Euclid space telescope reveals exquisite images of dark universeOpens in new window ]\n\nShe said the problem “lies in the fact that the inconsistencies in our current data do not hint at specific alternative models. There are many ways to resolve the issues, as well. Hence, we need more blowtorches to shed light in a 95 per cent dark and mysterious cosmological model. In particular, we need a more open-minded dialogue between mainstream and unconventional lines of research to escape the dead end we manoeuvred ourselves into.”\n\nClément Vidal, a philosopher at the Vrije University Brussels in Belgium, said Gough “paints an accurate picture of the crisis in cosmological models, as they are having a hard time to accommodate new observational data from JWST”.\n\nHe said theories in cosmology “are in a dark age, and the present crisis deserves to be addressed with new thinking”.\n\nHe noted that previously Gough predicted using an evolutionary take on cosmology drawing on Lee Smolin’s theory of cosmological natural selection that galaxies should form as early as 100 million years after the big bang.\n\nHe said evolutionary theory and thinking have been “successfully extended well beyond the biological realm, into culture, technology but also economics or psychology. Evolutionary cosmology continues this extension, and offers a new paradigm for cosmology. This is still early, and more effort is needed to further test new predictions, ideally with more detailed models making even more specific predictions, published in peer-reviewed articles so that more scientists can engage in this fascinating debate.”\n\nJohannes Jaeger, an evolutionary biologist, systems thinker and philosopher based at the University of Vienna, said Gough’s James Webb predictions “should stand as evidence that he is certainly no crackpot”.\n\nHe accepted that while “evolutionary cosmology may be speculative at this point” it could “contain the kind of explanation that could tell us why the parameters of the universe are fine tuned the way they are. At least, it seems to me, somebody in the physics community should be open to having a look at this theory”, and while Gough’s ideas “are no doubt speculative [they] are definitely worthy of checking out. Isn’t this how science was meant to work?”"}

Because that's what the Orange One wants him to find! Via the New York Times:\n\nDr. Eric Rubin, the editor in chief of N.E.J.M., described the letter as “vaguely threatening” in an interview with The New York Times. At least three other journals have received similar letters from Edward Martin Jr., a Republican activist serving as interim U.S. attorney in Washington. Mr. Martin has been criticized for using his office to target opponents of the administration.\n\nHis letters accused the publications of being “partisans in various scientific debates” and asked a series of accusatory questions about bias and the selection of research articles. Do they accept submissions from scientists with “competing viewpoints”? What do they do if the authors whose work they published “may have misled their readers”? Are they transparent about influence from “supporters, funders, advertisers and others”? News of the letter to N.E.J.M. was reported earlier by STAT, a health news outlet.\n\nMr. Martin also asked about the role of the National Institutes of Health, which funds some of the research the journals publish, and the agency’s role “in the development of submitted articles.” Amanda Shanor, a First Amendment expert at the University of Pennsylvania, said the information published in reputable medical journals like N.E.J.M. is broadly protected by the Constitution.\n\nIn most cases, journals have the same robust rights that apply to newspapers — the strongest the Constitution provides, she added. “There is no basis to say that anything other than the most stringent First Amendment protections apply to medical journals,” she said. “It appears aimed at creating a type of fear and chill that will have effects on people’s expression — that’s a constitutional concern.”"}

Now, Rokita provides fresh insight, with a new clip capturing two F-117s currently operating out of Groom Lake, the legendary Area 51, while Tonopah undergoes major reconstruction works.\n\nAlthough news of Tonopah’s temporary closure had already emerged, Rokita’s new video provides visual confirmation that the F-117s have returned, at least temporarily, to their original home at Groom Lake, where the iconic stealth fighters were first tested under strict secrecy during the early 1980s before starting clandestine operations at Tonopah. The footage marks a rare and historic sighting, bridging past and present for one of the most iconic aircraft in aviation history.\n\nThe closure of the airport is also confirmed by a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen), which further specifies that Tonopah will be closed until July 18, 2025.\n\nTonopah Test Range (KTNX) is currently closed per NOTAM until July 18th. There were x2 F-117s (callsign NIGHT) spotted at Groom Lake the other day from Tikaboo Peak. You can see one jettison it’s chute on the runway. They’re returning back to the womb. 😎 🎥 n01_b4_flash pic.twitter.com/LCZFr3BiI5 — Thenewarea51 (@thenewarea51) April 26, 2025\n\nThe latest video published by Rokita on his YouTube channel “n01_b4_flash” shows flight activity at the secretive base on Apr. 8-10, 2025. Among the aircraft he was able to catch are some common visitors of Groom Lake, such as the Janet B737 and Beech King Air aircraft, as well as two visitors from the other secretive airport in the area.\n\n“This time I was fortunate to catch F-117s ops at… Groom Lake!” told us Michał. “That is very special moment for me as I wanted to catch them particularly there, thinking that this is their current base with TTR being under reconstruction work at the moment, and mind you, I just saw what I wanted to see – simply amazing!”\n\nThe F-117 Nighthawk, the aircraft that doesn’t want to retire, is becoming once again an increasingly common sighting across the U.S. and is being often spotted also in low flight areas such as the famous Sidewinder transition, also known as Star Wars Canyon. It is no secret that the aircraft is being used both for training and testing, as demonstrated by the participation to multiple exercises such as Northern Edge.\n\nRemarkably, Michał also spotted two mysterious aircraft, which were flying with the callsign “MIG,” as opposed to the F-117’s callsign “NIGHT.” The combination of haze and distance doesn’t allow to identify, but a multitude of aircraft are known to operate there, including F-16s.\n\nPrevious Area 51 spotting\n\nLast year, Michał was once again in the area nearby Groom Lake, on Tikaboo Peak, an 8,000 ft mountain located approximately 26 miles to the east of Groom Lake. He spent the night there, and was almost able to catch something very interesting.\n\nIn fact, while throughout the night the base remained mostly quiet, the base’s personnel was preparing to launch a secretive aircraft in the darkness of the night. However, a UH-60 helicopter was sent to investigate a “Watchdog Tango”.\n\nThe term “Watchdog Tango”, which combines the idea of a spotter (watchdog) and Tikaboo (Tango, the phonetic ‘T’), is the codeword used over radio comms for spotters at Tikaboo watching. In this case, the Watchdog Tango condition led to the cancellation of a mission about to launch from Area 51, highlighting the secretive base’s remarkable detection capabilities, even in complete darkness and from 26 miles away.\n\nIn other words, they are aware of observers on public land (the helicopter is most probably dispatched to confirm what other sensors located there may have collected) and will not conduct clandestine flight tests if there is any risk of disclosing sensitive information.\n\nThe F-117 continues to fly\n\nHere is what we previously wrote about the F-117 still being in activity today, even if it was officially retired by the U.S. Air Force in 2008:\n\nWe have reported in details that 15 years after being officially retired, the F-117s are still flying not only for training purposes as adversary aircraft and cruise missile surrogate, but also for research, development, test and evaluation, possibly related to next generation programs. In accordance with the Nation Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2007 (PL 109- 364, Section 136), 52 F-117 aircraft were retired and relocated to the Tonopah Test Range (TTR). Under the requirements of the NDAA, the USAF preserved each F-117 aircraft in Type-l000 (T-1000) storage, which maintains the aircraft in a condition that allows recall for future service. On 30 November 2016, Section 133 of Subtitle D of the National Defense Authorization Act repealed the requirement to preserve the F-117 aircraft in a recallable condition and the USAF intended to declassify, demilitarize, and disposition four F-117 aircraft per year. The aircraft continued to be spotted, even more than it had happened until then, with the Nighthawks also deploying to several U.S. bases to carry out Dissimilar Air Combat Training with other U.S. types. Then, in 2021, the U.S. Air Force published the first official images of the type still involved in flight operations on the DVIDS (Defense Visual Information Distribution Service) network. In September 2022 the Air Force Test Center published a Request For Information (RFI) about a possible 10-year contract for maintenance and logistics support services for the F-117A fleet at the TTR airfield, acknowledging that the U.S. Air Force is willing to keep the aircraft flying at least until 2034. In 2024, reports mentioned that the Air Force was planning to certify the F-117A Nighthawk to be able to refuel from the KC-46A Pegasus, the service’s new tanker. The news was first anticipated by Andrew Hunter, then the Air Force’s Service Acquisition Executive, to the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces. It is not known how many Nighthawks are still airworthy. As of January 2023, of the 59 F-117s built, approximately 45 F-117s were in the inventory, with more than 10 already approved for transfer to museums. The current disposal rate is only between two and three jets per year, instead of four per year announced in 2017.\n\nA big thank you to Michał “n01_b4_flash” Rokita for sharing the video with us.

There’s barely any mention of it online except for my own desperate Reddit posts trying to find someone who agrees with me.\n\nWhat’s more, due to the peripherals it came packed with, it’s currently very difficult to buy – and it’s also one of the only games Nintendo have listed as being unplayable on the Switch 2.\n\nSo, from a preservation point of view, this article might be the last chance for people to realise that Kablasta scratches the same competitive itch as Wii Bowling, while in many ways offering a tighter, more varied experience that doesn’t deserve to be forgotten.\n\nKablasta is the Switch's hidden, shining jewel\n\nSome people likely haven't even heard of the game, so let’s do a quick recap and make some bold statements in the process.\n\nKablasta was released as part of the Labo VR Kit, one of two games designed to show off the large orange blaster gun. It's a two-player competitive experience that is — if you ignore the two-hour ordeal of setting up the actual gun — a huge omission from any list of the Switch’s best couch multiplayer games. Sadly, its competitive nature also makes it ineligible for our own list of the best couch co-ops.\n\nJust like Wii Bowling, it's pure fun: play with some friends, have a good time, win or lose, get addicted, and play again.\n\nThrough the VR, you’re transported to a sun-drenched Aztec-style pool arena. The gun you're holding in real life is replicated in the VR world as a cartoonish blunderbuss. From two coloured scoring zones on either side, players take turns aiming and firing different kinds of fruit into the open mouths of hippos in the water. Some hippos are alert, mouths open, ready and waiting. Others are facing away from you or dozing with their faces submerged and can't be hit.\n\nSubscribe to Nintendo Life on YouTube 813k\n\nA look above your head reveals plenty of floating pieces of fruit – apples, different melons, bananas, different coloured grapes, pineapples, and so on. Pump the gun so that a little vortex from the barrel satisfyingly sucks in your chosen fruit, take aim, anticipate the arc and behaviour of each item, fire, and luxuriate in the impressively engineered thud of the Labo blaster.\n\nIf a hippo gulps down that fruit, it'll swim towards you and into your scoring zone. Make a difficult shot and hit a hippo at the far edge of the pool and, as it swims towards you, it'll push the other hippos into your scoring zone along with it, allowing for multiple points in one go. You can also steal hippos from your opponent, along with a few other tactical twists.\n\nAdded together, Kablasta’s gameplay makes it one of the most compelling and competitive casual multiplayer games I’ve ever played, built on slow-paced strategy, precision aiming, sabotaging your opponent, and the tension that comes with not wanting to make a mistake and fall behind.\n\nFruit for thought\n\nTime for an even bigger statement. Kablasta — along with at least one other Labo VR multiplayer — provides unique pass-and-play VR gameplay that doesn’t exist elsewhere. The strapless design of the Switch's VR means that you’re able to pass the gun between turns effortlessly. This is instant, fun, and accessible VR gameplay – historic in its own way.\n\nI daydream about why people failed to notice this game – the difficult build, how Labo was marketed at kids, the comparatively low resolution of the Switch’s screen.\n\nThe one thing I know for sure is that the out-of-the-box settings don’t sell its strengths. You have to change the default five pieces of fruit to ten pieces of fruit (as each piece of fruit represents one round, you’re doubling the length of the game). Selecting ‘fruit sharing’ is better too. It means players choose from the same selection, which adds weight to your choices.\n\nIf each game only lasts five rounds, as per the default, the impact of messing up a shot is completely lost and there’s no sense of building your score, no jeopardy.\n\nMax out those rounds and you have a 10-shot, 20-minute multiplayer experience that slow burns to a tense finale. Seven or eight rounds in, you've carefully built a decent score – make a killer shot in the ninth, steal some hippos, and experience a genuine rush of excitement. Miss and feel pure disappointment. Lose and you’ll need to play again. You’ll demand a rematch. There are echoes of real-life sports and games. The final moments of a curling match. The final shots of Mölkky.\n\nMore than hungry hippos\n\nElsewhere, there are other impressive elements, the kind of attention to detail like when you accidentally threw your ball backwards in Wii Bowling and the characters all jumped up in surprise. In Kablasta the enthusiastic announcer, the cheering crowd, and the strange way that the hippos somehow feel as if they are familiar with the sport — professionals somehow — add a subtle touch of Nintendo quality.\n\nAnd there’s depth. You need to master the different types of fruit and choose when best to use each one. Grapes fire like machine gun bullets or like a shotgun spread, depending on their colour. Bananas curve like boomerangs. Apples fly straight. Lean back and fire the pineapple high into the air and see it drift downwards like a helicopter seed, attracting multiple hippos around its landing zone. Blast a watermelon against a hippo's forehead and it explodes into pieces that can feed multiple hippos.\n\nYou also need to play around with the whistle — which turns hippos, potentially opening up difficult shots — and the latch on the side of the blaster that, when flipped, displays each hippo’s preferred fruit. Choose correctly and the hippo swims towards you with added momentum. Arguably, Wii Bowling had far less going on.\n\nWith my best ever shot I aimed at the tree in the middle of the pool, another feature that adds strategic depth. I fired, knocked off four mangoes, fed multiple hippos, including the green hippo, worth triple points. Those hippos pushed five more along with them into my scoring zone – and I basked in the satisfaction of hearing the briiing briiing briiing sound out ten times for each point.\n\nWhen I passed over the gun, I had glee in my eyes.\n\nEveryone I’ve ever played Kablasta with — nieces and nephews, brothers and sisters, parents, friends — enjoyed it. That experience of bringing together multiple generations of gamers and non-gamers hadn’t happened for me since the Wii.\n\nTechnically, you can play Kablasta without the VR goggles, but it’s not how it’s meant to be experienced. And that’s a shame. With the Switch 2’s larger form factor — and slim-to-no chance of a Labo VR revival — this multiplayer gem looks set to be left behind. Part of me wonders if a few clever tweaks (some gaffer tape adjustments to the Labo cardboard, maybe) might somehow salvage it, providing the Switch 2 loads the cartridge.\n\nRegardless, Kablasta deserves a place in history. My only hope is that this article will help make that happen."}

As I sit writing these words, the city is poised for a moment we’ve dreamt about all season. Liverpool, my club, my heart, can win the Premier League today at Anfield.\n\nIt’s not just about the points. It’s about what this title would mean after a season of relentless energy, patience, and belief. Listening to the latest chatter among fellow Reds, there’s a common feeling — this is our time. The players, drilled to perfection by Arne Slot, understand the magnitude of what lies ahead. The fans, giddy with nerves and excitement, are planning their Sunday rituals, whispering of crate stashes and celebratory pints yet to be pulled.\n\nThere’s an old saying that fortune favours the brave. Liverpool have been nothing but brave. Today is about writing history the Liverpool way.\n\nHigh Standards – Lack of Fire?\n\nRival fans will still try, but there’s no denying the quality at every level in this Premier League. From Fulham pulling off a win against Liverpool to Crystal Palace stealing a draw against Arsenal, the reality is clear: technical quality and athleticism are at an unprecedented high across the division.\n\nEven down at 17th, sides like West Ham parade players of remarkable calibre — the likes of Bowen, Kudus and Paquetá would grace most European teams. It should, in theory, fuel the drama. Yet the truth is more complex. While the pitch brims with artistry, it too often lacks urgency. The fire that turns a season into legend seems stubbornly absent.\n\nAnd that stings for Liverpool fans, used to setting the standard for passion and ferocity. The Premier League is polished, but polish is not passion. Matches feel competitive but rarely desperate; technical excellence is widespread, but the fever that once defined English football is harder to locate.\n\nThis isn’t about nostalgia. It’s about a fundamental shift in how competition feels — a shift Liverpool must navigate without losing their heart.\n\nRelegation Dogfights Replaced by Comfortable Midtables\n\nIn decades past, a glance towards the bottom of the table promised heartbreak, last-minute winners, and grown men in tears. Survival was a brutal, glorious war. Now? With so much quality packed into even mid-to-lower table squads, the genuine relegation battles have dwindled into tame affairs.\n\nTeams like Crystal Palace and Wolves, filled with international talent, hover safely above the drop without needing to break into a sweat. Even when Liverpool faced off against so-called strugglers this season, it rarely felt like a contest of life and death — more a measured negotiation.\n\nIt begs the question: if everyone is so good, where has all the desperate drama gone? If 17th is merely a mark of missed ambition rather than impending doom, what edge remains? Where is the terror, the heartbreak, the sheer desperate beauty of survival Sunday?\n\nFor Liverpool, for the Premier League itself, it’s a subtle erosion of what once made English football utterly magnetic. A league without genuine peril at both ends runs the risk of becoming a spectacle without true consequence.\n\nRicher Than Ever, But Not Necessarily Better\n\nIt’s impossible to ignore the financial leviathan that the Premier League has become. Chelsea, Manchester City and others have capitalised, importing talent from every corner of the globe. Even clubs in midtable can now shop in markets that once belonged only to Europe’s elite.\n\nYet as Liverpool push deeper into the Arne Slot era, it’s worth questioning whether sheer quality alone can satisfy. Technique is plentiful; jeopardy is not. Every pass is crisper; every run, sharper. Yet the stakes — the palpable weight of consequence — often feel lower.\n\nFootball, at its core, is about moments of soaring triumph and devastating failure. The Premier League’s surge in quality has, paradoxically, made those moments rarer. The cold logic of elite performance has smoothed away much of the beautiful chaos.\n\nAnd if Liverpool supporters know anything, it’s that football without stakes quickly becomes theatre without tension. Klopp’s Liverpool, and now Slot’s Liverpool, thrive on stakes — the kind that make your pulse race and your palms sweat.\n\nIt’s not enough simply to assemble talent. The real trick, now, is igniting it.\n\nLiverpool’s Challenge – Flattened Hierarchy\n\nFor Liverpool, thriving in this new Premier League demands adaptation without losing soul. Arne Slot inherits a side that remains a giant but must now cut through the growing noise of “good” teams with something truly great.\n\nIt isn’t enough simply to be better drilled, fitter, or technically sharper than the likes of Villa or Brighton anymore. Liverpool must bring heart, grit, and ingenuity to pierce the cautious professionalism that dominates midtable.\n\nIn that sense, the bar is set higher than ever — and yet curiously, the emotional charge that once came with that challenge feels diminished. Rivalries still burn, but the sense of a league alive with peril and possibility — of a Liverpool match meaning everything — feels rarer than it should.\n\nFor those of us who remember Liverpool scrapping past Stoke on a rainy Tuesday or outclassing Arsenal in a 4-4 thriller, today’s Premier League sometimes feels sanitised. A sparkling bauble, but one that rattles hollow when shaken.\n\nIf Liverpool can rekindle not just brilliance but jeopardy — real, desperate jeopardy — then they can do more than win leagues. They can restore meaning to a sport in danger of losing its soul.\n\nEmotional Resilience Under Arne Slot\n\nIf today’s Anfield showdown is anything to go by, Arne Slot has already succeeded where many feared he might falter. Taking over from a titan like Jürgen Klopp was never going to be easy. The demands placed on Liverpool managers are unique, woven from decades of European nights and domestic glories.\n\nSlot’s achievement this season isn’t merely tactical. It’s emotional. He’s steeled a Liverpool squad frayed by departures and expectation, turning them into a team capable of playing with heart as well as precision.\n\nThe calm authority with which Slot has carried himself — refusing to panic when others did, managing pressure without retreat — has been remarkable. He knows what it means to lead Liverpool. And today, against Tottenham Hotspur, his Liverpool side will walk out knowing history is in their hands.\n\nVictory will not simply be a triumph of skill. It will be a triumph of spirit.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Liverpool’s Moment of Truth\n\nToday’s showdown against Spurs isn’t just another game. It’s a culmination. A season defined by resilience, crafted by a manager who, at only 46, has shown the calm of a veteran campaigner. Slot has taken the burden placed squarely on his shoulders and worn it like a crown. His message to the players has been simple: you think you’re good? Then go and prove it.\n\nThe buzz around the city, from Fazakerley to Speke, is a mixture of childlike giddiness and battle-hardened belief. Liverpool stand on the brink, not because others have faltered, but because Liverpool have risen to every challenge hurled their way.\n\nAnd rise they must once more. Victory today would not merely secure another trophy for the Anfield cabinet; it would reaffirm everything Liverpool supporters hold dear — the passion, the stakes, the glory earned not given.\n\nIn a Premier League increasingly painted in muted watercolours, Liverpool today can paint it in vivid red.\n\nUp the Reds."}

On the Daily Red Podcast for Anfield Index, host Dave Davis captured the mood of excitement, stating, “Liverpool are on the brink of history tomorrow, one point will mean they are crowned champions.”\n\nAs the Reds prepare to host Spurs at Anfield, the atmosphere is electric. Davis described the feeling perfectly: “You can taste Sunday already, can’t you? It is going to be absolutely brilliant.” It’s a moment Liverpool fans have been building towards, with Davis urging supporters to enjoy every second of the day, “It’s almost hard not to just steer every single thought you’ve got to tomorrow.”\n\nArne Slot’s Steady Influence\n\nLiverpool’s manager Arne Slot continues to impress in his debut season, setting the stage for this title-defining clash. Davis noted how Slot handled recent events with maturity, especially around key players. Reflecting on Slot’s press conference, Davis emphasised, “He talked about Darwin Nunez and applause; we have to talk about Darwin Nunez today.”\n\nDespite the enormous pressure surrounding the fixture, Slot has maintained a calm exterior, guiding Liverpool through a challenging title race. As Davis predicted confidently, “I’m going to be honest about this, I predicted on post-conference press yesterday 3-0 Liverpool to win.”\n\nSlot’s steadiness was even more apparent when addressing team distractions, particularly those involving Darwin Nunez.\n\nDarwin Nunez: Frustration Boils Over\n\nA major talking point from the podcast was Darwin Nunez’s ill-advised social media post ahead of the Spurs clash. Davis detailed the situation, saying, “Darwin Nunez tweeted this morning… which translated as ‘No wonder I didn’t play more because the last game I started in the Premier League went well and suddenly…'”\n\nThe tweet, quickly deleted, raised concerns. Davis did not hold back in his assessment: “This is just stupid from Darwin, isn’t it?” He continued, “On the verge of such a big game… idiocy.” Despite the frustration, Davis believes Nunez will still feature in the matchday squad, explaining, “I think he will be in the squad tomorrow, asset management as they call it.”\n\nFans have been divided on the issue, with Davis acknowledging, “I completely understand those fans who are now in the camp of as many people are tweeting ‘Don’t let the door hit your ass on the way out.'”\n\nDavis also made it clear that this situation should not overshadow the bigger picture: “It doesn’t taint it because it’s still all about us and the celebration.”\n\nChampions-in-Waiting\n\nThe final words from Davis on the Daily Red Podcast perfectly summed up the mood ahead of Sunday’s showdown: “It’s natural, honestly legs are twitching at this… basically one point to win the Premier League. I just can’t wait to get down to Anfield.”\n\nThere’s a sense of inevitability and pure joy among Liverpool supporters as they prepare for what could be one of the most memorable days in the club’s illustrious history. Despite Darwin Nunez’s moment of madness, all focus remains on the team, the fans, and Arne Slot guiding Liverpool to glory once again."}

For Liverpool, as we march towards a Premier League-winning summer, the need to act decisively in shaping the squad’s defensive future has never felt more pressing. The name Dean Huijsen is attracting heavy attention across Europe, with Liverpool among those keen, but the Anfield club must first focus inward: securing Ibrahima Konaté to a new long-term contract should take precedence.\n\nRising Star: Why Dean Huijsen Is On Everyone’s Radar\n\nDean Huijsen’s meteoric rise from the Juventus academy to Premier League prominence with Bournemouth is no fluke. At just 20 years old, he has showcased the rarest of commodities — composure and technical assurance beyond his years. Analysts marvel at his two-footedness, his grace in ball progression, and his command in defensive duels. Standing over six foot five, Huijsen combines physicality with elegance, launching passes from deep areas and stepping into midfield like a seasoned quarterback.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, and even Real Madrid have monitored his progress closely. His £50 million release clause seems almost modest when weighed against his vast potential. Yet, therein lies the paradox: while Huijsen promises a glittering future, Liverpool already possess a defensive cornerstone in Ibrahima Konaté — and he demands immediate attention.\n\nKonaté Contract More Crucial Than Huijsen Chase\n\nKonaté, at 25, is entering his prime years. His performances have been pivotal to Liverpool’s resurgence, blending pace, anticipation, and strength to fashion one of the Premier League’s most feared centre-halves. Unlike Huijsen, who, while dazzling, still represents potential rather than certainty, Konaté has proven his mettle against Europe’s very best.\n\nLiverpool’s defensive rebuild should start not with acquisition but retention. In a world where Chelsea offer young talents eight-year deals and Real Madrid hover for tomorrow’s superstars, Liverpool must signal their commitment to today’s elite. Securing Konaté to a new contract is not just wise — it is essential. Allowing his situation to drift risks not only unsettling the squad but inviting opportunistic suitors into the fray.\n\nHuijsen Represents Brilliant But Risky Long-Term Bet\n\nThis is not to diminish Dean Huijsen’s qualities. Far from it. Should Liverpool move for the Dutch-Spanish centre-back, it would represent an astute investment in the club’s medium-to-long-term future. Joe Gomez, loyal but oft-injured, seems destined for a summer exit. Jarell Quansah, promising though he may be, carries the uncertain burden of youth; will he reach the elite level Liverpool demand?\n\nIn this context, Huijsen feels like a natural evolution — a player who can rotate, learn, and eventually lead. However, competition will be fierce. Chelsea’s notorious willingness to offer sprawling, lucrative deals to young players — as seen with Moisés Caicedo and Roméo Lavia — puts them in a strong position once again. If Chelsea dangle a seven-year deal, guaranteed first-team minutes, and a cleverly negotiated Real Madrid release clause, Liverpool’s traditional incentives might fall short.\n\nMoreover, Liverpool’s misfortunes against Chelsea in recent transfer battles are still fresh. Watching Caicedo and Lavia opt for Stamford Bridge despite Anfield’s call was a bitter pill. The potential irony looms large: those same players could soon be applauding the newly crowned Premier League champions at Stamford Bridge in a guard of honour.\n\nSmart Squad Planning Will Define This Summer\n\nArne Slot’s Liverpool will be defined by its transfer market dexterity this summer. The backline, in particular, requires nuanced thought. Replacing or supplementing Gomez and planning beyond Virgil van Dijk’s eventual twilight cannot be left to chance. Yet, strengthening foundations must come before stretching ceilings.\n\nKonaté’s new deal would send a clear signal: Liverpool reward excellence, loyalty, and proven pedigree. Only after solidifying the present should the club fully engage in the race for Huijsen. Otherwise, the risk is double-edged — destabilising the current unit while gambling heavily on a talent still some way from full maturity.\n\nHuijsen may yet choose Chelsea, seduced by the glamour of immediate starts and lucrative security. Liverpool cannot and should not break their structure chasing him. Instead, they must operate as they did in Michael Edwards’ Sporting Director tenure: focused, rational, patient. Should Huijsen decide he wants to forge a career built on legacy and triumph rather than contract length and personal clauses, Anfield’s gates will be open.\n\nUntil then, Konaté’s signature must be Liverpool’s primary defensive victory this summer."}

She is under much pressure and I understand how she feels.”\n\nLui, who raised the matter during an appearance in a TV show recently, said he was saddened that Lin had to deal with the online vitriol.\n\nMany of Lui’s female fans accused Lin of using her physical attributes to seduce him.\n\nLui, 28, said he had initially opted to keep silent when Lin was being criticised, fearing that the situation would worsen if he speaks out.\n\nHowever, his silence had only attracted more hate towards Lin.\n\n“I want to tell everyone that she is a good person.\n\n“She is important to me. She helped me a lot when I was feeling down.”\n\n“I know how haters think, but I hope those who love me will not attack her,” he said.\n\nLui urged his fans to allow him space in his personal life.\n\nBased in Taiwan, Lin, 34, has released several music albums and appeared in TV series and films.\n\nThe above articles are compiled from the vernacular newspapers (Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese and Tamil dailies).

(0:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- A look at what's happening around the New York Jets:\n\n1. Big investment: It started in 2020 and it continued through Thursday night with the selection of tackle Armand Membou. It's quite extraordinary, almost historic.\n\nThe Jets became the first team in a quarter century to select four first-round offensive linemen in a six-draft span, according to ESPN Research. The last teams to do it were the Detroit Lions and Seattle Seahawks, both from 1996 to 2001.\n\nBefore Membou, there was Olu Fashanu (2024), Alijah Vera-Tucker (2021) and Mekhi Becton (2020), who is no longer with the team. The Jets' new regime, continuing what the previous administration started, is making a concerted effort to turn the offensive line into the foundation of the franchise.\n\n\"It's a solid wall. It's a strong wall up front,\" former Jets general manager Joe Douglas said in his role as a guest analyst on Fox Sports radio -- his first public comments since being fired in November. \"I think [Membou] is a great pick. It's a mentality pick.\"\n\nDouglas said Membou has \"the most upside of any tackle in the draft,\" noting his \"elite\" footwork, bend and length. The current group of decision makers felt the same way, opting to invest more significant capital into an already-popular fund.\n\nCall it a hedge fund -- a way to safeguard their new quarterback, Justin Fields.\n\nQuite frankly, it's a position group that has underperformed in recent years. The Jets finished 23rd in pass block win rate last season, per ESPN Research. Prior to that, they ranked 30th, 21st, 17th and 29th in that metric. New coach Aaron Glenn wants to change that, and he wants to do it in a way that makes the offensive line the calling card of the offense.\n\nGlenn has seen this before. In his second year as a New Orleans Saints assistant (2017), the team drafted tackle Ryan Ramczyk in the first round. In his first year as a Lions assistant (2021), they picked tackle Penei Sewell with the seventh overall pick -- the same slot as Membou.\n\n\"I come from two teams ... where everything was about the offensive line,\" Glenn said. \"I'm a firm believer that you start it inside out. So if we can build our line, just as much as our defensive line, that only helps you as a team. It helps your quarterback, it helps your running backs, it helps your passing game, and it just creates an identity within your team. You're trying to make sure that every team, when they watch film, they see that.\"\n\nFrom left to right, the Jets' line will be Fashanu, John Simpson, Joe Tippmann, Vera-Tucker and Membou. On opening day, they all will be 28 (Simpson) and under. Of course, there are no guarantees in this business.\n\nThe turn-of-the-century Lions, with their beefed-up line blocking for Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders, never won a playoff game in that period. The Seahawks finally broke through with an NFC championship in 2005, featuring an offensive line that included two of their four first rounders from 1996 to 2001 -- Walter Jones and Steve Hutchinson, both Hall of Famers.\n\nThe New York Jets made offensive tackle Armand Membou the No. 7 overall pick Thursday. Kena Betancur/AP\n\n2. By the book: A few weeks ago, Glenn said the offseason goal for the organization was to \"move in silence.\" It certainly adhered to that mantra in the draft. General manager Darren Mougey's first draft was all about substance, not flash.\n\nIn Round 1, he opted for an offensive lineman over highly-rated tight end Tyler Warren. In Round 2, he drafted tight end Mason Taylor, a surehanded possession receiver (9.9 yards per reception), over big-play tight end Elijah Arroyo (16.3). In Round 3, he took cornerback Azareye'h Thomas over some speedy wide receivers.\n\nMougey didn't draft a quarterback and didn't deviate from his list of needs. He made two trades on Day 3, moving up for safety Malachi Moore (fourth round) and defensive end Tyler Baron (fifth).\n\n\"I think the No. 1 thing is, we really got guys that fit the brand of who we're going to be,\" Glenn said.\n\n3. Time will tell -- or will it? Glenn is a former scout who prides himself on his ability to evaluate talent, especially cornerbacks -- the position he played for 15 years. So when he stands on the table for a player like Thomas, whose stock dropped because of a pedestrian 40-yard dash time (4.58 seconds), it's worth paying attention.\n\nGlenn said he learned from one of his former players, like Lions cornerback Brian Branch, that game speed is more important than stopwatch speed. Branch clocked a 4.58 in 2023 and slipped to the second round, but now he's one of the best DBs in the league.\n\n\"Seeing how he plays on the field, that's more enticing to me than watching a guy run in underwear at the combine,\" Glenn said.\n\nThomas dismissed his 40 time, saying, \"I'm not a 40 guy, I'm not a stat guy, I'm a film guy.\"\n\n4. A gift for Fields: Taylor could be a key addition for quarterback Justin Fields. How important is a good tight end to him? Very.\n\nFields has an 87.7 QBR when targeting tight ends over the last two seasons, per ESPN Research. Only Lamar Jackson (93.9) and Brock Purdy (92.4) have a higher QBR in that span (minimum: 20 games played).\n\n5. Crossing T's, dotting I's: It's amazing how, even after months of intense scouting and research, a decision can come down to a phone call -- or, in Membou's case, a video call with Glenn. That occurred a few days before the first round, as the Jets checked in with a few players.\n\nMougey said the objective in an 11th-hour call is to fill in a blank or challenge a player with a certain question. The Jets conducted several conversations with Membou over the last two months -- a former interview at the combine, a visit to the facility on March 27 (his 21st birthday) and a few conversations this past week.\n\nEvidently, Membou said what they wanted to hear.\n\n\"[They were] just getting to know me one more time before the draft and just seeing what my mentality was going into NFL,\" Membou said.\n\n6. Stacks of pancakes: If you want to be entertained, check out Membou's high school highlights.\n\nAaron Rodgers last season with Jets Aaron Rodgers finished 25th in QBR last season (48.2), the second-worst mark of his career, behind only the last time he started multiple games in 2022. He also averaged career lows in yards per attempt and yards per dropback. Rank QBR 48.2 25th Yards per attempt 6.7* 28th Yards per dropback 5.8* 27th * Career lows\n\n-- ESPN Research\n\nIt's six-plus minutes of utter domination. He serves up more pancakes than a short-order cook at IHOP. The most eye-catching play occurs at the 35-second mark.\n\nIn pass protection, Membou locks up his man around midfield and steers him all the way to the sideline, continuing to drive even after the play is over. It's something straight out of \"The Blind Side\" movie.\n\n7. Big wheels: You already know about Membou's impressive 40-yard dash at the scouting combine (4.91 seconds at 332 pounds), but he also has been clocked at 21 mph on the field reportedly, based on GPS tracking.\n\nTo put that into perspective, the Jets only had one ball carrier reach 21 mph last season -- cornerback Brandin Echols on an interception return, per Next Gen Stats.\n\n8. Volunteer work: When a player wants a contract extension, he sometimes boycotts the voluntary portion of the offseason program to send a message and protect himself from injury. Cornerback Sauce Gardner, wide receiver Garrett Wilson, running back Breece Hall and linebacker Quincy Williams would be justified in taking that route, but they're all participating to varying degrees, according to multiple sources. That's a positive.\n\n9. Glaring omission: They failed to address one of their top needs -- defensive tackle, one of the deepest positions in the draft. They got jumped by the Buffalo Bills in the fourth round, trading up one spot ahead of the Jets to select defensive tackle Deone Walker. The Bills suspected the Jets might grab him.\n\n10. The last word: Glenn was asked if he had a response to Aaron Rodgers' recent criticism of him. \"Absolutely,\" Glenn said. For a moment, it appeared as if he might fire back at the Jets' former quarterback. But ... \"Membou is a really good player,\" he said, \"and I'm so excited he's a Jet.\""}

Wearing a mask to impress other people.\n\nIf the face you always show the world is a mask, someday there will be nothing beneath it. Because when you spend too much time concentrating on everyone else’s perception of you, or who everyone else wants you to be, you eventually forget who you really are. So don’t fear the judgments of others; you know in your heart who you are and what’s true to you. You don’t have to be perfect to impress and inspire people. Let them be impressed and inspired by how you deal with your imperfections.\n\n2. Keeping negative company (without boundaries).\n\nDon’t let someone who has a bad attitude give it to you. Don’t let them get to you. Take a step back. Distancing yourself from those who give you negative vibes or unhealthy energy is self-care. Stepping back from situations where you feel unappreciated or disrespected is self-care. Choose to honor your feelings and boundaries. When you remember that keeping the constant company of negative people is a choice, instead of an obligation, you free yourself to keep the company of compassion instead of anger, generosity instead of greed, and patience instead of anxiety.\n\n3. Being selfish and egotistical.\n\nA life filled with loving deeds and good character is the best tombstone. Those who you inspired and shared your love with will remember how you made them feel long after your time has expired. So carve your name on hearts, not stone. What you have done for yourself alone dies with you; what you have done for others and the world remains.\n\n4. Avoiding change and growth.\n\nIf you want to know your past look into your present conditions. If you want to know your future look into your present actions. You must let go of the old to make way for the new; the old way is gone, never to come back. If you acknowledge this right now and take steps to address it, you will position yourself for real and lasting progress. (Note: “The Good Morning Journal” is a great tool for this kind of daily self-reflection.)\n\n5. Letting others create your goals and dreams for you.\n\nThe greatest challenge in life is discovering who you are; the second greatest is being happy with what you find. A big part of this is your decision to stay true to your own goals and dreams on a daily basis. Do you have people who disagree with you? Good. It means you’re standing your ground and walking your own path. Sometimes you’ll do things considered crazy by others, but when you catch yourself excitedly losing track of time, that’s when you’ll know you’re doing things right.\n\n6. Giving up when the going gets tough.\n\nThere are no failures, just results. Even if things don’t unfold the way you had expected, don’t be disheartened or give up. Learn what you can and move on. The one who continues to advance one step at a time will win in the end. Because the battle is always won far away and long before the final victory. It’s a process that occurs with small steps, decisions, and actions that gradually build upon each other and eventually lead to that glorious moment of triumph.\n\n7. Trying to micromanage every little thing.\n\nLife should be touched, not strangled. Sometimes you’ve got to relax and let life happen without incessant worry and micromanagement. Learn to let go a little before you squeeze too tight. Take a deep breath. When the dust settles and you can once again see the forest for the trees, take the next step forward. You don’t have to know exactly where you’re going to be headed somewhere great. Everything in life is in perfect order whether you understand it yet or not. It just takes some time to connect all the dots.\n\n8. Settling for less than you deserve.\n\nBe strong enough to let go and wise enough to wait for what you deserve. Sometimes you have to get knocked down lower than you have ever been to stand up taller than you ever were before. Sometimes your eyes need to be washed by your tears so you can see the possibilities in front of you with a clearer vision again. Don’t settle.\n\n9. Endlessly waiting until tomorrow.\n\nThe trouble is, you always think you have more time than you do. But one day you will wake up and there won’t be any more time to work on the things you’ve always wanted to do. And at that point you either will have achieved the goals you set for yourself, or you will have a list of excuses for why you haven’t. (Read “The Last Lecture”.)\n\n10. Being lazy and wishy-washy.\n\nThe world doesn’t owe you anything, you owe the world something. So stop daydreaming and start DOING. As they say, develop a backbone not a wishbone. Take full responsibility for your life — take control of your next step. You are important and you are needed. It’s too late to sit around and wait for somebody to do something someday. Someday is now; the somebody the world needs is YOU.\n\nHow to gradually let go of old regrets.\n\nThe points above are crucial reminders, but what if you already have regrets you’re struggling with?\n\nNo doubt, feelings of regret sometimes sneak up on us. Oftentimes we regret things simply because we worry that we should have made different decisions in the past. We should have done a better job, but didn’t. We should have given a relationship another chance, but didn’t. We should have started that business, but didn’t…\n\nWe compare the real outcomes of our past decisions to an ideal fantasy of how things “should” be. The problem of course is that we can’t change those decisions, because we can’t change the past. Yet we resist this reality subconsciously — we keep overanalyzing and comparing the unchangeable reality to our ideal fantasy until we’ve wasted lots of time and energy.\n\nBut why?\n\nIf we logically know better, why can’t we just let all our ideals and fantasies GO?\n\nBecause we identify personally with these ideals and fantasies. We all have this vision in our minds of who we are — our well-meaning intentions, our intelligence, our social impact, etc. And we make the best decisions we can of course, because again, we generally mean well. Even if you struggle with deep-seeded self-esteem issues, you probably still identify with yourself as being a decent and respectful human being.\n\nAnd so when someone says something about us that contradicts the vision of ourselves that we identify with — they insult our intentions, our intelligence, our status, etc. — we take offense. We feel personally attacked, and we have a hard time letting it go.\n\nSomething very similar happens when we believe we did something — made a mistake — that contradicts the same vision of ourselves that we identify with. We take offense! In some cases we implode on ourselves — we berate ourselves for making the mistake: “How could I have done this?” we think. “Why couldn’t I have been smarter and made a better decision?” And again, we have a hard time letting it go — we have a hard time coming to grips with the fact that we aren’t always as good as the vision we have of ourselves.\n\nSo in a nutshell, our ideals and fantasies about ourselves tend to cause us lots of misery.\n\nThe key is to gradually practice letting go of these ideals and fantasies, and focus instead on making the best of reality. The truth must be embraced…\n\nEvery bad decision we made in the past is done — none of them can be changed. And in fact there’s some good in every one of those bad decisions too, if we choose to see it. Just being able to make a decision at all is a gift, as is being able to wake up in the morning, and being able to learn and grow from our wide-ranging life experiences.\n\nAnd in fact there’s some good in every one of those bad decisions too, if we choose to see it. Just being able to make a decision at all is a gift, as is being able to wake up in the morning, and being able to learn and grow from our wide-ranging life experiences. We are not actually what we envision ourselves to be, at least not always. We are human and therefore we are multi-layered and imperfect. We do good things, we make mistakes, we give back, we are selfish, we are honest, and we tell white lies sometimes. Even when we are doing our absolute best, we are prone to slip. And once we embrace this and get comfortable with our humanness, making a bad decision tends to conflict a lot less with our new, more flexible (and accurate) vision of ourselves.\n\nOf course, all of this is easier said than done, but whenever you find yourself obsessing over and regretting a past decision, you can 1) acknowledge that you’re falling into this pattern, 2) realize that there’s some ideal or fantasy you’re comparing your decisions and yourself to, and 3) practice letting go of this ideal or fantasy and embrace a wider range of reality in the present moment.\n\nNow it’s your turn…\n\nOne day you will find yourself closer to the end, thinking about the beginning.\n\nTODAY is that beginning!\n\nTODAY is the first day of the rest of your life.\n\nI challenge you to put the principles of this article to good use.\n\nMotivate yourself to START NOW by answering a simple question:\n\nWhat’s one thing YOU CAN choose to do today that you will NOT regret?\n\nPlease leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay.

But while the stories and settings of those mainline numbered installments are all independent of one another, the shared themes, gameplay systems, musical cues, and visual motifs tie the series’ installments to one another.\n\nFor example, a recurring character class in Final Fantasy is the Black Mage, who, starting from the original Final Fantasy in 1987, can be identified by a tall, wide-brimmed hat that obscures the wearer’s face while marking them as a user of offense-oriented magic. It’s one of the most distinctive costume designs in the entire RPG genre, and now it’s something you can make part of your wardrobe in the real world too.\n\nWhile the Black Mage hat makes multiple appearances across the Square Enix franchise, dedicated Final Fantasy fans are likely getting an extra-strong hit of nostalgia here. The hat’s design is modeled specifically after the one worn by Vivi, the shy, purehearted Black Mage with a tragic backstory from Final Fantasy IX, currently celebrating the 25th anniversary of its release for the original PlayStation and often cited by Final Fantasy original creator Hironobu Sakaguchi as his favorite game in the series.\n\nBitmapped graphics were still the norm in video games when the first Final Fantasy came out, and so the Black Mage hat wasn’t originally designed with much concern over how the headwear would fit in three-dimensional spaces. That’s something you’ll need to take into consideration with the real-world Vivi’s hat, however, which is listed as having a height of 72 centimeters (28.3 inches) and a brim width of 14 centimeters extending from the central cone, so you might want to be careful if your quest for the day is taking you somewhere with low ceilings or doorways.\n\n\n\nVivi’s Black Mage Hat is available for preorder now through the Square Enix e-store here, priced at 17,600 yen (US$121) with shipping scheduled for mid-August, which suggests it should be in fans’ hands/on fans’ heads by Halloween.\n\nSource: Square Enix e-store via Hachima Kiko\n\nTop image: Square Enix e-store\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

As Apple progresses through the final stages of beta testing, this update not only addresses current user needs but also sets the stage for the transition to iOS 19. Below is an in-depth look at the most notable changes and their implications for users. The video below from iReviews gives us more details about the update.\n\nEnhanced Performance for Optimized Device Efficiency\n\nApple continues to focus on performance optimization with iOS 18.5, making sure that devices operate more efficiently and responsively. Beta testing has demonstrated measurable improvements in both single-core and multi-core performance scores, which directly translate to faster app launches, smoother multitasking, and reduced lag during resource-intensive activities. These advancements are particularly beneficial for users who rely on their devices for demanding tasks such as video editing, gaming, or running complex applications.\n\nBy fine-tuning system processes and optimizing resource allocation, Apple is delivering a more seamless experience. As the beta testing phase progresses, additional refinements are expected, making sure that the final public release offers a polished and reliable performance upgrade.\n\nSmarter Battery Management for Long-Term Reliability\n\nBattery life remains a top priority for users, and iOS 18.5 introduces several features aimed at addressing this concern. A standout addition is the new charge limit recommendation feature, accessible through the battery settings. This tool provides actionable insights to help users maintain battery health by avoiding overcharging, which can degrade battery performance over time.\n\nAdditionally, early feedback from beta testers highlights improved energy efficiency across the system. These enhancements suggest that Apple has fine-tuned background processes and power management algorithms to strike a balance between performance and battery longevity. For users, this means fewer interruptions due to low battery and a more reliable device experience throughout the day.\n\nRefined Gesture Recognition and Expanded Customization Options\n\niOS 18.5 introduces updates to gesture recognition, enhancing usability and reducing frustration caused by accidental inputs. The return of back tap banners is a notable improvement, as these notifications alert users to unintended gestures, helping them avoid unwanted actions. This feature is particularly useful for those who rely on gesture-based navigation or accessibility tools.\n\nOn the customization front, iOS 18.5 offers greater flexibility in tailoring the user interface. Users can now choose to display or hide contact photos in the Mail app, allowing for a cleaner or more personalized inbox appearance. The redesigned AppleCare section in the settings menu further simplifies access to support and warranty information, making it easier for users to manage their devices. For families or individuals focused on digital well-being, customizable screen time notifications provide enhanced control over device usage, allowing users to set limits that align with their goals.\n\nRelease Timeline and System Updates\n\nThe release schedule for iOS 18.5 is becoming increasingly clear as beta testing advances. The final beta version, beta 4, is anticipated by April 28, followed by the Release Candidate (RC) version around May 5 or 6. The public release is projected for May 12, offering users a chance to experience the full range of enhancements.\n\nIn addition to iOS 18.5, Apple plans to release iOS 18.4.2, which will address minor bugs and provide incremental improvements for users who may not immediately upgrade to the latest version. This staggered rollout ensures that all users, regardless of their update preferences, benefit from a stable and reliable operating system.\n\nSetting the Stage for iOS 19\n\nWhile iOS 18.5 delivers significant improvements, it also serves as a bridge to the next generation of Apple’s operating system. Incremental updates, such as the expected iOS 18.6, will continue to refine the user experience, but the spotlight is already shifting to iOS 19. With its beta release confirmed for June 9, iOS 19 promises to introduce new features and further elevate the Apple ecosystem.\n\nBy addressing critical areas such as performance, usability, and battery management in iOS 18.5, Apple is laying a solid foundation for the transition to iOS 19. This forward-thinking approach ensures that users can seamlessly adapt to the next major software iteration without compromising on functionality or reliability.\n\nWhy iOS 18.5 Matters\n\niOS 18.5 is more than just a routine update; it is a thoughtfully designed package of enhancements aimed at improving the functionality and user experience of Apple devices. Whether you are seeking to optimize your device’s performance, extend its battery life, or explore new customization options, this update offers something for everyone.\n\nWith the public release just weeks away, now is the ideal time to familiarize yourself with the changes and prepare to take full advantage of the improvements. As Apple continues to innovate and refine its software, iOS 18.5 serves as a testament to the company’s commitment to delivering a superior user experience.\n\nUncover more insights about iOS 18.5 features in previous articles we have written.\n\nSource & Image Credit: iReviews\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

With the latest iOS advancements, you can design a home screen that reflects your personal style while enhancing usability. From interactive widgets to personalized icons and theme automation, these tools allow you to craft a setup that is visually appealing and highly practical. By exploring these techniques, you can transform your iPhone into a device that seamlessly integrates into your daily life. The video below from Sam Beckman shows us how to customize the iPhone like a pro.\n\nInteractive Widgets: Adding Functionality to Your Home Screen\n\nInteractive widgets have transformed how you interact with your iPhone. Unlike static widgets, these allow you to perform tasks directly from your home screen, saving time and improving efficiency. For instance, you can control music playback, check reminders, or view real-time weather updates without needing to open individual apps.\n\nTo customize widgets, you can import them using URLs or JSON files, offering a high degree of flexibility. This means you can tailor widgets to suit your specific needs. Imagine a weather widget that not only displays current conditions but also includes dynamic visuals, blending functionality with design. These widgets bring your home screen to life, making it more engaging and user-friendly. By incorporating interactive widgets, you can streamline your daily tasks and enhance the overall functionality of your device.\n\nCustom Wallpapers: Enhancing Visual Cohesion\n\nWallpapers play a crucial role in defining the look and feel of your home screen. With iOS 18, gradient wallpapers have been introduced, offering a seamless blend with the dock for a cleaner and more cohesive appearance. These wallpapers adapt to system themes, automatically switching between light and dark modes based on your preferences.\n\nFor added dynamism, pair light and dark wallpapers with Focus mode. This allows your home screen to change throughout the day, aligning with your activities and mood. Whether you’re working, relaxing, or on the go, your wallpaper can complement the moment, creating a more immersive and personalized experience. By carefully selecting wallpapers that match your style and needs, you can achieve a visually harmonious and functional home screen.\n\nPersonalized Icons and Streamlined Organization\n\nCustom icons are a powerful way to redefine your iPhone’s interface. Using tools like the “Clear Icons” app, you can create and export icon packs inspired by Vision OS. These packs often include hundreds of icons, making sure a consistent and polished look across your home screen. Setting up custom icons is straightforward with the Shortcuts app, where you can create shortcuts for your apps and assign custom icons. This not only enhances the visual appeal of your device but also makes navigation more intuitive.\n\nFor a cleaner and more organized home screen, consider using pseudo-folders instead of traditional app folders. Pseudo-folders can be created using the “Choose from Menu” shortcut in the Shortcuts app, allowing you to group apps under a single shortcut. For example, you can create a pseudo-folder for productivity tools like Notes, Calendar, and Reminders. This approach combines minimalism with functionality, making sure quick access to essential apps without overwhelming your screen. By combining personalized icons with streamlined organization, you can create a home screen that is both stylish and efficient.\n\nTheme Automation and Future Customization\n\nTheme automation adds a dynamic layer to your home screen customization. By using Focus mode, you can set your iPhone to automatically switch between light and dark themes based on the time of day or your location. This ensures your home screen always aligns with your surroundings, creating a cohesive and adaptive experience.\n\nIf you prefer manual control, you can use a theme-switching shortcut to change themes on demand. This flexibility allows you to adjust your home screen’s appearance to suit your preferences at any moment. Looking ahead, staying informed about upcoming iOS updates, such as the anticipated iOS 19 dock redesign, will help you adapt your customization strategy. Features like transparency effects or dynamic elements may further enhance your ability to create a personalized and functional home screen.\n\nEfficiency Tips for a Cleaner Home Screen\n\nAn organized home screen is essential for both efficiency and aesthetics. Start by decluttering unnecessary apps and creating blank pages for a minimalist layout. This approach reduces distractions and helps you focus on the apps and widgets you use most frequently.\n\nTo simplify the customization process, take advantage of tools like the “Clear Icons” app and pre-designed wallpaper templates. These resources save time and ensure a professional finish, allowing you to focus on creating a home screen that meets your needs. By combining these efficiency tips with the customization techniques outlined above, you can design a home screen that enhances your daily workflow and reflects your unique style.\n\nMaster iPhone home screen customization with the help of our in-depth articles and helpful guides.\n\nSource & Image Credit: Sam Beckman\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

However, their knowledge is often static (frozen at the time of training), and they lack direct access to real-time information or the ability to interact with external systems (like your email or calendar).\n\nTools bridge this gap. They are small pieces of code (usually Python scripts) that define specific functions the LLM can call upon when needed. Think of them as giving your AI access to a calculator, a web scraper, an API connector, or even custom functions interacting with your databases or services.\n\nWhat are Open WebUI Tools, and How Do They Enhance LLMs?\n\nIn Open WebUI, Tools are integrated functionalities that extend the capabilities of your chosen LLM. When you interact with the AI, you can grant it access to specific tools. If it determines a tool is necessary to fulfil your request, the model can decide which tool to use and how to use it.\n\nHow Do Tools Work (Simplified)?\n\nUser Request + Tool Info: You send a prompt to the LLM. Open WebUI also sends descriptions of the tools the LLM has access to. These descriptions (docstrings in the code) tell the LLM what each tool does and what information (parameters) it needs. LLM Decides: The LLM analyses your request and the available tools. If it thinks a tool can help (e.g., you ask “What time is it?”), it decides to use the relevant tool (e.g., a getTime tool). It determines which function within the tool to call and what data to pass to it. Tool Execution: Open WebUI executes the specific Python function chosen by the LLM with the parameters provided by the LLM. Tool Response: The tool function runs and returns a result (e.g., the current date and time).\n\nLLM Final Answer: The LLM receives the tool’s result and uses it to formulate a final, more informed response to your original prompt.\n\nPro Tip: Tools work best when designed for specific, well-defined tasks. Making one tool do too many complex things can confuse the LLM.\n\nGetting Started with Tools\n\nAccessing and Managing Tools:\n\nYou can manage tools within Open WebUI by navigating to Workspace > Tools . Here you can:\n\nImport tools created by the community.\n\nCreate your own tools.\n\nEdit existing tools.\n\nnavigate to Tools screen\n\nLLM Requirements (Function Calling):\n\nThis is crucial: For tools to work reliably, the LLM you use must support “Function Calling” or “Tool Calling”. This capability allows the model to understand the tool descriptions and generate the structured requests to execute them. Many modern models available through Ollama (like newer versions of Llama, Mistral, etc.) and commercial APIs support this. Check the documentation for your specific model.\n\nExploring Available Tools:\n\nThe Open WebUI community maintains a hub where users share tools they’ve created. You can browse available tools here: https://openwebui.com/tools\n\nPro Tip: Security First! Tools execute code on your system. Always review the code of any community tool before importing and running it. Only import tools from trusted sources or ones whose code you understand.\n\nHands-on Tool Examples\n\nLet’s try a simple, safe example.\n\nExample: Getting the Current Date/Time\n\nGo to the Open WebUI Tools Hub. Find a simple “Get Time” or “Date/Time” tool (there might be several variations). Recommending this tool. Add the tool to your Open WebUI instance or copy the tool’s code. In Open WebUI, go to Workspace > Tools and click + — Add Tool. Paste the code or use the import feature. Save the tool. Start a new chat. Before sending your first message, click the + icon next to the message input bar and select your newly added Date/Time tool to give the model access for this chat session. Ask the LLM: “What is the current date and time?”\n\nThe LLM should recognise the need for the tool, execute it, and, based on its output, provide you with the current date and time.\n\nadd getTime tool\n\nOther Useful Community Tools:\n\nSafe Calculator : LLMs sometimes struggle with precise math (“hallucinate” calculations). A calculator tool ensures accuracy.\n\nLLMs sometimes struggle with precise math (“hallucinate” calculations). A calculator tool ensures accuracy. URL Web Scrape (uses Jina AI API): Allows the LLM to fetch and summarize content from a specific web page, giving it access to live web information.\n\nPro Tip: Start with simple, well-understood community tools like the date/time or calculator examples to get comfortable with the workflow before building or importing more complex ones.\n\nBuilding Your Own Tools\n\nThe real power comes when you create tools tailored to your specific needs. Open WebUI provides a clear structure for this.\n\n(Full tool code examples discussed here are available in our companion GitHub repository: pahautelman/open-webui-tool-skeleton)\n\nTool Template and Structure:\n\nA basic tool file looks like this (simplified from GitHub repo):\n\n\"\"\"\n\ntitle: My Awesome Tool # User-friendly name\n\nauthor: Your Name # Your name/handle\n\ndescription: Does something cool. # What the tool does\n\nrequirements: package1, package2 # Any external Python packages needed\n\nversion: 0.1.0\n\nlicense: MIT\n\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nfrom typing import Any, Callable, List\n\n\n\n# (Optional) EventEmitter for progress updates - good practice!\n\nclass EventEmitter:\n\n# ...

The LLM reads this!\n\nClearly describe what this specific action does.\n\n\n\n:param input_parameter: Describe what this parameter is for.\n\n:param another_param: Describe this optional parameter.\n\n:return: Describe what the function returns.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nevent_emitter = EventEmitter(__event_emitter__) # Use emitter if passed\n\nawait event_emitter.progress_update(\"Starting cool action...\")\n\n\n\n# --- Your Tool Logic Goes Here ---\n\n# Access config via self.valves.api_key or self.user_valves.user_preference\n\nresult = f\"Processed '{input_parameter}' with threshold {self.valves.threshold}\"\n\n# --- End of Tool Logic ---\n\n\n\nawait event_emitter.success_update(\"Cool action complete!\")\n\nreturn result # Return the result\n\nKey Components:\n\nMetadata (Top Docstring): title , author , description , requirements , etc. This is crucial for Open WebUI to manage the tool and install dependencies ( pip install runs for listed requirements).\n\n, , , , etc. This is crucial for Open WebUI to manage the tool and install dependencies ( runs for listed requirements).

Be mindful of potential conflicts with Open WebUI’s dependencies. Security: Be extremely careful if your tool interacts with external APIs or files or executes system commands: Sanitise inputs and limit permissions where possible.\n\nPro Tip: Your method’s docstring is the API description for the LLM. Write it as if you were explaining exactly how to use that function to another developer (or a very smart AI). Be precise about parameters and return values. Pro Tip: Use the EventEmitter to give users feedback, especially for tools that might take a few seconds to run. It dramatically improves the user experience.\n\nAdvanced Tool Use Cases: Email and Meeting Assistant\n\nLet’s imagine creating a more complex workflow using multiple custom tools. We’ll build:\n\nEmailLookupTool : Finds email addresses from a local store and can add new ones. EmailSendingTool : Sends emails via the Gmail API. GoogleMeetSchedulingTool : Schedules meetings via the Google Calendar API.\n\n(The complete code for these tools, including setup instructions for Google API credentials, is available in the GitHub repository: pahautelman/open-webui-email-calendar-assistant\n\nEmail Lookup Tool (EmailLookupTool)\n\nThis tool uses fuzzy matching to find names in a local JSON file ( email_dictionary.json ) and return the associated email. It also includes a function to add new name/email pairs.\n\nKey Features:\n\nUses fuzzywuzzy to find similar names.\n\nto find similar names. Configurable similarity threshold ( Valves ).\n\n). Methods: lookup_email(person_name) and add_entries(names_str, emails_str) .\n\nEmail Sending Tool (EmailSendingTool)\n\nThis tool requires Google API credentials (set up via Google Cloud Console and added to the tool’s Valves). It uses OAuth2 for authentication (the first time you use it, it will likely open a browser window for you to grant permission).\n\nKey Features:\n\nUses Google’s Python client libraries.\n\nHandles OAuth2 authentication flow ( gmail_token.json is created).\n\nis created). Securely configured via Valves for credentials.json content.\n\nfor content. Method: send_email(to, subject, message_text) .\n\nMeeting Scheduling Tool (GoogleMeetSchedulingTool)\n\nLike the email tool, this uses Google Calendar API credentials and OAuth2. It can create calendar events with Google Meet links.\n\nKey Features:\n\nUses Google Calendar API.\n\nHandles OAuth2 ( calendar_token.json created).\n\ncreated). Creates events with automatic Meet link generation.\n\nSupports attendees, time zones, and descriptions.\n\nMethod: schedule_meet(summary, start_time, end_time, attendees?, time_zone?, description?) .\n\nConfigure tool valves\n\nPutting It All Together (Example Interaction):\n\nadd email entries\n\nImagine you’ve added these three tools and enabled them in your chat:\n\n— You: “What’s the email address for Dr. Evelyn Reed?”\n\nLLM uses EmailLookupTool.lookup_email\n\n— You: “Okay, please email her asking if she’s available for a brief meeting next Tuesday at 2 PM CET to discuss the research proposal.”\n\nLLM recognizes the need for EmailSendingTool, but needs confirmation\n\n— You: “Yes, looks good. Send it.”\n\nLLM uses EmailSendingTool.send_email\n\n— You: “Now, schedule a 30-minute meeting with her for next Tuesday at 2 PM CET. The summary should be ‘Research Proposal Discussion’.”\n\nLLM uses GoogleMeetSchedulingTool.schedule_meet , calculates end time, checks timezone\n\nNote: The AI agent failed to recognise that the meeting scheduling action also needs confirmation. This emphasises the importance of not trusting your LLM to perform actions that could have severe consequences.\n\nPro Tip: For tools that perform actions with real-world consequences (sending emails, modifying calendars, interacting with databases), it’s highly recommended to configure your LLM agent (via Model Personalization / System Prompt) to always ask for user confirmation before executing the tool action. Add instructions like: “Before using the email or scheduling tools, always present the details (recipient, subject, time, etc.) to the user and ask for confirmation before proceeding.” Pro Tip: Securely handle API keys and credentials. While Valves are the standard way in Open WebUI Tools, be aware of who can access your Open WebUI instance if sensitive keys are stored there. Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in the main tool logic if possible.\n\nSafe and Responsible Use of Tools\n\nTools are powerful, but they come with risks if not used carefully.\n\nIncorrect Tool Usage: The LLM might misunderstand your request or the tool’s description and call the wrong tool or the right tool with incorrect parameters. This can lead to unexpected results or errors. Clear docstrings and confirmation steps help mitigate this.\n\nThe LLM might misunderstand your request or the tool’s description and call the wrong tool or the right tool with incorrect parameters.

Only install tools you trust or whose code you have reviewed.\n\nAs mentioned, tools execute code. A poorly written or malicious tool could access sensitive data, delete files, or interact with the internet in harmful ways. Developer Responsibility: If you build and share tools, consider potential misuse. Build in safeguards, handle errors gracefully, and be clear about what your tool does and what permissions it needs.\n\nGuidelines for Safe Tool Integration:\n\nReview Code: Always inspect the code of community tools before installing them. Understand Permissions: Be aware of what APIs or system resources a tool accesses (especially for tools using Google APIs, file system access, etc.). Limit Access: Enable only tools for a specific task or conversation. Use Confirmation Steps: Ensure the LLM asks for confirmation for action-oriented tools. Create specialised agents (or personalise models) that can only access the tools needed for their intended function. For agents managing safety-critical tools (like sending emails, modifying calendars, deleting files, or interacting with sensitive systems), use a system prompt that explicitly instructs the agent to always seek user review and permission before executing these tools. The agent must present the exact parameters it intends to use for the tool call for user verification. (Refer to our first article in this series on creating specialised models/agents and guidelines for crafting effective system prompts.) Keep Updated: Keep Open WebUI updated, as new versions may include security improvements.\n\nPro Tip: Regularly audit the tools you have installed in Open WebUI and remove any you no longer use or trust.\n\nConclusion\n\nOpen WebUI Tools transform your local LLM from a text processor into an active agent capable of interacting with real-time data and external systems. By understanding how they work, leveraging community tools, and carefully building your own, you can create powerful, customised AI workflows on your own machine.\n\nFrom simple tasks like fetching the time to complex sequences involving email and calendar management, tools offer a flexible way to extend your AI’s reach. Remember to prioritise safety and clarity, especially when building your own integrations.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nIn our upcoming articles, we’ll delve deeper into related Open WebUI features like Image generation, Functions and Pipelines, exploring more structured ways to orchestrate complex AI tasks.\n\nStay tuned, and happy experimenting with Open WebUI Tools!\n\nReferences\n\npahautelman/open-webui-tool-skeleton\n\npahautelman/open-webui-email-calendar-assistant"}

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.8%, which is fairly typical for the industry.\n\nOur free stock report includes 4 warning signs investors should be aware of before investing in OCB Berhad. Read for free now.\n\nOCB Berhad's Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future Distributions\n\nWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. However, prior to this announcement, OCB Berhad's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.\n\nOver the next year, EPS could expand by 61.3% if recent trends continue. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 18% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.\n\nKLSE:OCB Historic Dividend April 27th 2025\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for OCB Berhad\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The last annual payment of MYR0.02 was flat on the annual payment from10 years ago. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. OCB Berhad has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 61% per annum. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.\n\nOCB Berhad Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.\n\nCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Genting Berhad's (KLSE:GENTING) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nOur free stock report includes 1 warning sign investors should be aware of before investing in Genting Berhad. Read for free now.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Genting Berhad, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.086 = RM8.1b ÷ (RM105b - RM11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nTherefore, Genting Berhad has an ROCE of 8.6%. On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 8.4% average generated by the Hospitality industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for Genting Berhad\n\nKLSE:GENTING Return on Capital Employed April 27th 2025\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Genting Berhad's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Genting Berhad .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nGenting Berhad has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 56% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nIn summary, we're delighted to see that Genting Berhad has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And given the stock has remained rather flat over the last five years, there might be an opportunity here if other metrics are strong. That being the case, research into the company's current valuation metrics and future prospects seems fitting."}

Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 3.1%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nCredit Bureau Asia's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. Before this announcement, Credit Bureau Asia was paying out 82% of earnings, but a comparatively small 32% of free cash flows. In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.\n\nEarnings per share could rise by 7.0% over the next year if things go the same way as they have for the last few years. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 78% which is a bit high but can definitely be sustainable.\n\nSGX:TCU Historic Dividend April 27th 2025\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Credit Bureau Asia\n\nCredit Bureau Asia Is Still Building Its Track Record\n\nLooking back, the dividend has been stable, but the company hasn't been paying a dividend for very long so we can't be confident that the dividend will remain stable through all economic environments. Since 2021, the dividend has gone from SGD0.034 total annually to SGD0.04. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.1% over that duration. We like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income.\n\nCredit Bureau Asia Could Grow Its Dividend\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Credit Bureau Asia has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 7.0% per annum. Recently, the company has been able to grow earnings at a decent rate, but with the payout ratio on the higher end we don't think the dividend has many prospects for growth.\n\nIn Summary\n\nOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment."}

More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. Trends like this ultimately mean the business is reducing its investments and also earning less on what it has invested. And from a first read, things don't look too good at ecoWise Holdings (Catalist:5CT), so let's see why.\n\nWe've discovered 2 warning signs about ecoWise Holdings. View them for free.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for ecoWise Holdings, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.0036 = S$77k ÷ (S$32m - S$11m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2025).\n\nThus, ecoWise Holdings has an ROCE of 0.4%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Commercial Services industry average of 5.5%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for ecoWise Holdings\n\nCatalist:5CT Return on Capital Employed April 27th 2025\n\nWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you want to delve into the historical earnings , check out these free graphs detailing revenue and cash flow performance of ecoWise Holdings.\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nIn terms of ecoWise Holdings' historical ROCE trend, it isn't fantastic. To be more specific, today's ROCE was 3.0% five years ago but has since fallen to 0.4%. On top of that, the business is utilizing 56% less capital within its operations. The fact that both are shrinking is an indication that the business is going through some tough times. If these underlying trends continue, we wouldn't be too optimistic going forward.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn summary, it's unfortunate that ecoWise Holdings is shrinking its capital base and also generating lower returns. It should come as no surprise then that the stock has fallen 26% over the last five years, so it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Unless there is a shift to a more positive trajectory in these metrics, we would look elsewhere.\n\necoWise Holdings does have some risks, we noticed 2 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about.\n\nWhile ecoWise Holdings may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Read for free now.\n\nBrook Crompton Holdings' Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. Before making this announcement, Brook Crompton Holdings was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.\n\nUnless the company can turn things around, EPS could fall by 10.7% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 34%, which is definitely feasible to continue.\n\nSGX:AWC Historic Dividend April 27th 2025\n\nSee our latest analysis for Brook Crompton Holdings\n\nBrook Crompton Holdings' Dividend Has Lacked Consistency\n\nBrook Crompton Holdings has been paying dividends for a while, but the track record isn't stellar. Due to this, we are a little bit cautious about the dividend consistency over a full economic cycle. There hasn't been much of a change in the dividend over the last 8 years. Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.\n\nThe Dividend Has Limited Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Brook Crompton Holdings' EPS has fallen by approximately 11% per year during the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough.\n\nIn Summary\n\nOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for Brook Crompton Holdings that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is Brook Crompton Holdings not quite the opportunity you were looking for? Why not check out our selection of top dividend stocks.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

Based on the last payment, Kimlun Corporation Berhad was earning enough to cover the dividend, but free cash flows weren't positive. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 35.9% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 8.7%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.\n\nKLSE:KIMLUN Historic Dividend April 27th 2025\n\nSee our latest analysis for Kimlun Corporation Berhad\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from MYR0.03 total annually to MYR0.02. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 4.0% per year. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.\n\nKimlun Corporation Berhad May Find It Hard To Grow The Dividend\n\nGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. In the last five years, Kimlun Corporation Berhad's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 4.0% per annum. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.\n\nKimlun Corporation Berhad's Dividend Doesn't Look Sustainable\n\nOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 2 warning signs for Kimlun Corporation Berhad you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

(NYSE:MEC) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 24% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been very strong. It's fair to say most would be happy with 145% the gain in that time. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nWe've discovered 2 warning signs about Mayville Engineering Company. View them for free.\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Mayville Engineering Company moved from a loss to profitability. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNYSE:MEC Earnings Per Share Growth April 27th 2025\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Mayville Engineering Company's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWhile the broader market gained around 9.3% in the last year, Mayville Engineering Company shareholders lost 11%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 20%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Mayville Engineering Company (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here."}

With features such as a larger display, a 120Hz refresh rate, and innovative game-sharing capabilities, the console aims to elevate portable gaming to new heights. However, certain trade-offs, including the absence of an OLED screen and potentially reduced battery life, may influence its appeal for some users. The video below from Tim Schofield gives us a detailed look at the new Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nDesign and Build\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 features a 7.9-inch 1080p LCD display, offering sharper visuals and a smoother 120Hz refresh rate. This improvement is particularly noticeable in fast-paced games, where fluid motion and crisp details enhance gameplay. However, the lack of OLED technology means the display may not deliver the deep contrasts and vibrant colors seen in other devices, which could be a consideration for players who prioritize visual fidelity.\n\nThe console’s slightly larger and heavier frame provides a more robust and durable feel, though it may slightly impact portability for users who prefer a lightweight device. Improved ergonomics, including better button placement and softer button presses, make extended gaming sessions more comfortable. The redesigned kickstand, now more adjustable and stable, enhances tabletop gaming by providing a practical and enjoyable setup for multiplayer or solo play.\n\nJoy-Cons and Controls\n\nThe updated Joy-Cons are a standout feature of the Nintendo Switch 2, offering several enhancements that improve usability and durability. Larger joysticks provide better grip and precision, while the durable metal SL/SR buttons ensure longevity. A magnetic attachment system creates a secure and seamless connection to the console, reducing the risk of accidental disconnections during gameplay.\n\nA dedicated C button for game chat adds convenience for online multiplayer sessions, while enhanced haptic feedback delivers a more immersive gaming experience. Additionally, the Joy-Cons now support mouse-like controls, expanding their functionality beyond gaming to include tasks such as navigation and creative applications. These upgrades cater to a diverse audience, from casual players to competitive gamers, by offering responsive and versatile controls.\n\nPerformance and Features\n\nPowered by a custom Nvidia processor, the Nintendo Switch 2 delivers faster load times and smoother overall performance, making sure a seamless gaming experience. The inclusion of Wi-Fi 6 connectivity enhances online gameplay by providing a stable and efficient connection, particularly for multiplayer sessions. With 256GB of internal storage and support for microSD cards, the console accommodates larger game libraries, meeting the demands of modern, storage-intensive titles.\n\nOne of the most notable features is the game-sharing functionality, which allows players to share games locally or online with friends. This feature fosters a more social gaming experience, allowing multiplayer enjoyment without requiring multiple copies of the same game. Whether you’re playing with friends in the same room or connecting online, this addition enhances the console’s appeal for collaborative play.\n\nDisplay and Audio\n\nThe inclusion of HDR support significantly enhances the visual experience, offering improved dynamic range and more vivid colors. Whether exploring expansive open worlds or engaging in high-stakes battles, the upgraded visuals add depth and realism to gameplay, making every scene more engaging.\n\nAudio has also been improved, with upgraded speakers delivering clearer and more immersive sound. The built-in microphone supports game chat and screen-sharing, further enhancing the console’s versatility for both solo and multiplayer gaming. These audio enhancements ensure that players can fully immerse themselves in their favorite games, whether at home or on the go.\n\nAccessories and Dock\n\nThe redesigned dock is a key component of the Nintendo Switch 2, offering 4K 60fps output for a superior gaming experience when connected to a larger screen. With HDMI, USB-C, and Ethernet ports, the dock ensures reliable connectivity and high-quality visuals for home gaming setups. This makes the console a versatile option for players who enjoy both handheld and docked gaming.\n\nAn optional camera accessory introduces motion-based gaming and group activities, adding a new layer of interactivity. This feature expands the console’s capabilities, making it suitable for a variety of gaming styles and social settings. Whether playing solo or with friends, the dock and accessories enhance the overall experience.\n\nBattery Life\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is equipped with a 5,220mAh battery, offering between 2 to 6.5 hours of gameplay depending on usage. While this is slightly shorter than the battery life of previous models, the faster charging time of approximately three hours helps mitigate the limitation. For players who prioritize extended gaming sessions, this may be a factor to consider, though the improved performance and features may outweigh the shorter battery life for many users.\n\nGame Compatibility\n\nBackward compatibility ensures that your existing Nintendo Switch game library remains playable on the new console, preserving your investment in previous titles. The console also supports faster data writing speeds, accommodating the demands of newer, more storage-intensive games. Launch titles such as “Mario Kart World” and “Donkey Kong Bonanza” showcase the console’s capabilities, setting the stage for an exciting future lineup.\n\nPro Controller\n\nThe redesigned Pro Controller offers a compact form factor and programmable buttons, allowing players to customize their gaming experience. An integrated audio jack adds convenience for private listening, making it a valuable accessory for dedicated gamers. With its ergonomic design and enhanced functionality, the Pro Controller is an excellent option for those seeking a more immersive and tailored gaming experience.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 strikes a balance between innovation and familiarity, offering a range of upgrades that appeal to both casual and hardcore gamers. While the absence of an OLED display and shorter battery life may be drawbacks for some, the console’s enhanced performance, improved controls, and new features make it a compelling choice. Whether you’re drawn to its 120Hz refresh rate, game-sharing functionality, or 4K dock output, the Nintendo Switch 2 sets a new benchmark for portable gaming, delivering a versatile and engaging experience for players of all types.\n\nExpand your understanding of Nintendo Switch 2 with additional resources from our extensive library of articles.\n\nSource & Image Credit: Tim Schofield\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

Recently, Bitcoin hit above $100,000 for the first time and is currently trading around $94,000, with analysts predicting it could reach $150,000 or more in 2025 Investopedia: Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2025.\n\nCorporate Adoption and Market Sentiment\n\nCompanies like Semler Scientific are increasing their Bitcoin holdings, with Semler pushing its stack to over 3,300 BTC, reflecting growing corporate adoption CoinDesk: Semler Scientific Increases Bitcoin Holdings. Market sentiment is bullish, with on-chain data showing large holders (whales) buying during rallies, and technical indicators like the Bitcoin to VIX ratio suggesting a potential long-term bottom CoinDesk: Bitcoin Whales Buy During Rally.\n\nDetailed Analysis of Top Bitcoin News as of April 28, 2025\n\nThis section provides a comprehensive analysis of the top Bitcoin news as of 06:41 AM +07 on Monday, April 28, 2025, focusing on recent developments, market trends, and expert predictions. The analysis is based on data from reputable cryptocurrency and financial news sources, ensuring a thorough and professional overview for readers seeking detailed insights.\n\nBackground and Methodology\n\nBitcoin, launched in 2009, remains the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with significant influence on the broader digital asset landscape. To compile this report, recent news articles from specialized sources like CoinDesk, Investopedia, and Cointelegraph were reviewed, focusing on publications dated April 25–27, 2025, to capture the most current information. The analysis covers price movements, institutional adoption, corporate treasury strategies, and market sentiment, ensuring a holistic view of Bitcoin’s current state.\n\nRecent Market Developments\n\nThe most notable news is the significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to CoinDesk: Bitcoin ETFs See $2.7B Inflows, Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.7 billion in inflows, potentially leading to Bitcoin climbing to fresh record prices. This development, reported on April 25, 2025, underscores growing institutional interest, with analysts suggesting these inflows could drive Bitcoin’s price upward in the near term.\n\nBitcoin’s price has also seen significant milestones. CoinGecko: Bitcoin Price Today and Cointelegraph: Bitcoin News Today indicate that Bitcoin hit above $100,000 for the first time in January 2025 and is currently trading around $94,000 as of April 27, 2025. This price level reflects a recovery from earlier volatility, with CNBC: Bitcoin Price Drops and Rebounds noting a drop to $74,000 before rebounding, highlighting Bitcoin’s sensitivity to global market conditions.\n\nPrice Predictions and Long-Term Outlook\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Bitcoin’s future, with several predictions for 2025 and beyond. Investopedia: Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2025 cites Deepwater Asset Management predicting Bitcoin hitting $150,000 in 2025, driven by ripe market and regulatory conditions. Similarly, Changelly: Bitcoin Price Prediction suggests a maximum price of $167,598.22 in 2025, while ARK Invest: Bitcoin Price Targets for 2030 projects bear, base, and bull cases of $300,000, $710,000, and $1.5 million per Bitcoin by 2030, respectively. These predictions are based on factors like ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic trends, though they acknowledge the inherent volatility and uncertainty in cryptocurrency markets.\n\nCorporate Adoption and Treasury Strategies\n\nCorporate adoption is another key trend, with companies increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. CoinDesk: Semler Scientific Increases Bitcoin Holdings reports that Semler Scientific increased its Bitcoin holdings to over 3,300 BTC with a $10 million purchase, reflecting a 23.5% year-to-date increase in Bitcoin yield. This aligns with broader trends, as Cointelegraph: Bitcoin News Today notes crypto firms entering Wall Street with equities offerings, showing growing synergy between traditional finance and digital assets. Michael Saylor’s prediction that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF will be the world’s biggest ETF in a decade, as reported by CoinDesk: Michael Saylor’s ETF Prediction, further underscores this trend.\n\nMarket Sentiment and Technical Analysis\n\nMarket sentiment remains bullish, with on-chain data showing significant whale activity. CoinDesk: Bitcoin Whales Buy During Rally indicates that large holders are buying during the price rally, potentially sustaining upward momentum. Technical indicators also suggest a positive outlook, with CoinDesk: Chart of the Week noting that the Bitcoin to VIX ratio might signal a potential long-term bottom, interpreted as a bullish signal for investors. Additionally, CoinDesk: Tariff Impact on Bitcoin discusses how tariff-related market carnage might be fulfilling Bitcoin’s promise as a store of value, suggesting its role as a hedge against economic uncertainty.\n\nRegulatory and Economic Context\n\nRegulatory developments play a role in Bitcoin’s trajectory, though recent news is mixed. CoinDesk: Swiss National Bank Rejects Bitcoin Reserves reports that the Swiss National Bank rejected calls to add Bitcoin to its reserves, a decision that might be seen as neutral or slightly bearish. However, the broader context of global economic uncertainty, including tariff impacts, seems to be driving interest in Bitcoin as a decentralized, scarce asset, as noted in CNBC: Bitcoin Price Drops and Rebounds.\n\nTemporal Context and Completeness\n\nAs of 06:41 AM +07 on April 28, 2025, the news analyzed is from April 25–27, 2025, ensuring recency. No breaking news from April 28, 2025, was found in the reviewed sources, but the trends identified—ETF inflows, corporate adoption, and bullish market sentiment—are likely to continue influencing Bitcoin’s trajectory in the immediate future.\n\nSignificance and Community Engagement\n\nThe combination of ETF inflows, corporate adoption, and bullish technical indicators suggests Bitcoin is entering a phase of increased mainstream acceptance. Community responses, inferred from news articles, include enthusiasm for price milestones and corporate moves, with analysts and investors viewing Bitcoin as a maturing asset class. This aligns with its original thesis as a decentralized, borderless store of value, potentially vindicated by current economic conditions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe top Bitcoin news as of April 28, 2025, centers on record ETF inflows, recent price milestones, and increasing corporate adoption, with bullish market sentiment and technical indicators supporting further growth. While regulatory developments like the Swiss National Bank’s decision are notable, the broader trend leans toward Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance and its role as a hedge against economic uncertainty. This analysis provides a comprehensive view for readers seeking to understand Bitcoin’s current landscape and future potential.\n\nKey Citations"}

I’ll find somewhere else to sit.\n\nIn terms of Pokémon evolutions, Eevee’s are among the most, well, evolutionary-looking. Whereas some Pocket Monster species take on drastically different forms when they evolve, acquiring significantly humanoid or monstrous appearances, it’s easy to trace the lineage of the many Eeveelutions, as each one is essentially Eevee with the addition of a few elemental design elements.\n\nFor example, here’s the new Eevee plushie that’s just been announced by the Pokémon Center megastore chain in Japan…\n\n…and here’s the new plushie for Vaporeon, Eevee’s Water-type evolution.\n\nSure, Vaporeon gets a more aquatic-oriented tale and fins, but overall it’s not all that different from the regular Eevee. However, both of these plushies are life-size versions of the Pokémon, as per their official Pokédex entries, and so they remind us that there’s also a very big difference between the standard Eevee and the Eeveelutions.\n\nWhen looking at the incremental appearance changes for the Eeveelutions it’s easy to forget that they’re exponentially larger than their base species. So while the life-size Eevee plushie is a sensible 41 centimeters (16.1 inches) in length, once it turns into Vaporeon it grows to 92 centimeters (36.2 inches) long!\n\n▼ Fits on your lap!\n\n▼ Can claim dominion over your sofa!\n\nJoining Vaporeon in life-size Eeveelution plushie form are Electric-type Jolteon, who’s even longer at 96 centimeters, and Fire-type Flareon, the longest of the bunch at 110 centimeters.\n\nOf course, this family tree is broader than just Eevee, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon, and the Pokémon Center is promising life-size plushies of Umbreon, Espeon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon too at some point down the Snorlax-unobstructed road.\n\n▼ You’ll essentially have to cede your living room to them in its entirety, but be honest, you’ll be happy to do so.\n\nNote that you will want to give proper consideration to where you place the life-size Eeveelutions, since they’re not just big, but heavy too. Vaporeon and Jolteon each weigh in at 4.4 kilograms (9,7 pounds), and heavyweight Flareon tips the scales at 5.8 kilos. The life-size Eevee plushie, meanwhile, is a svelte 396 grams. Eevee is also the most affordably priced, at 3,850 yen (US$26.50), while each of the Eeveelutions is 44,000 yen.\n\n▼ Yes, this means that the life-sized Vaporeon and Jolteon cost one yen a gram.\n\nEevee is available for immediate purchase through the Pokémon Center online shop here, which is also accepting Eeveelution preorders for Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon (here, here, and here) for shipping starting in early November. Note that when placing your order for a life-size Eeveelution no other items can be placed in the cart, as though they require digital space in proportion to their physical dimensions.\n\nSource: Pokémon Center Online\n\nTop image: Pokémon Center Online\n\nInsert images: Pokémon Center Online (1, 2), Twitter/@poke_times, Pokémon Center Online (3, 4)\n\n● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

Nothing needs to be replaced, and it will last forever.\n\nWhen WACOM showed Good e-Reader their product, they said it aimed primarily at the E INK digital notebook market.

If you aren't there yet, you should definitely hop into one of our other articles. You are welcome.\n\nAfter an excruciatingly long wait, the fifth and final season of You has finally landed on the 2025 TV schedule for Netflix subscription holders. Unsurprisingly, the season is downright nuts. It introduces a new love interest for Penn Badgley’s Joe Goldberg, who ultimately winds up being the key to finally giving Joe what he truly deserves. Although I do have some mixed feelings about the final season, Badgley explained why the series finale was an appropriate end, and I agree with him.\n\nThroughout Season 5 of the stalker drama, Joe tries to live a new life but, of course, different variables keep getting in the way, like his past coming back to haunt him and more people seeking to expose him.\n\nBy the series finale, Joe is finally caught and sentenced to prison on many, many counts for the murders of Beck and Love. He’ll be spending the rest of his life in prison, and Badgley told EW why it was the appropriate end for him, despite a number of viewers wanting him to be killed:\n\nThe finale, to me, it's doing everything that could possibly be done in a satisfying manner. I think he's delivered to his truly appropriate end. And then the only thing left is to realize [that] there is no ending that could satisfy anyone 100 percent, because justice for a man like Joe isn't in and of itself satisfying. I mean, he's an abuser. He's a killer. He's a bad person. So I think being satisfied is a positive thing.\n\nObviously, it would have been easier to kill Joe, whether he was shot by Bronte in the woods or in some other fashion. However, the Gossip Girl alum makes a good point. Not only was justice finally served for Beck and Love after all these years, but Joe now has to spend the rest of his life alone. He always searches for the next person to fixate on, hence the entire plot of the show. With that, him now not having anyone kind of human connection, except for the deranged fan letters he’s been getting in prison, is certainly poetic and feels like a long time coming.\n\n(Image credit: Netflix)\n\nWhat It Felt Like To Get To The End Of You As A Fan\n\nFor fans, there was no way of knowing how You would end. Despite it being a loose book-to-screen adaptation of Caroline Kepnes' novel series, the show diverted from the books following the first season, keeping fans on their toes in the process. Like Badgley said, not everyone is going to be satisfied with the ending, but I was satisfied knowing what Joe is going to endure in prison is a whole lot worse for him than just being sentenced to death.\n\nThat aside, You’s final season brought back some familiar faces, but, unfortunately, series alum Jenna Ortega was not one of them. After starring in the second season as Ellie Alves, Ortega never returned. There was some hope that Ortega could return, and she previously expressed her disappointment about not being able to appear in the fourth season due to her Wednesday filming schedule. The creators still had ideas for her return, and I’m so sad they couldn't be used.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhen a show nears its end, it's common that viewers hope the main character gets their due in one way or another. If you ask me, You certainly dished out a worthy fate for Joe, and I'm glad how his ending panned out. While I'm also sad the show is over, I look forward to rewatching the journey from the beginning."}

Democrats will tell you your convenience is more important than a valid election. Please don’t buy that line of garbage; while you are at home filling out your ballot, they are out gathering bogus ballots that cancel your vote. Stand in line, show your identification, and make your vote count.\n\nI start at the elections because that is the lynchpin for all taxes, bills, and fees. In Oregon, we have vote by mail or, as we call it, cheat by mail. Now the Democrats in Salem can use their supposed supermajority status to force their will on the people.\n\nHere are some of the idiotic failures the Democrats have managed to foster in Oregon.\n\nPortland now has a $1-billion debt hole that it doesn’t know how to fix. As a result, one swimming pool is cracked and unusable. Driving through Portland is like driving in a war zone after a tank battle; the potholes are deep and continuous.\n\nNot to be outdone, ODOT, the Oregon Department of Transportation, has made road repairs on Route 26 that act like ramps to launch cars into the roadside ditches.\n\nWashington County Clean Water Services spent $92,000 on business lunches last year, and the county commissioners, a majority of whom are Democrats, continue to act like total incompetents. They are willing to accept new guidelines that will track future lunch expenditures. Nobody has been fired or resigned, but the commissioners promise they are looking into it.\n\nThe Oregon Democrats have also bought in to the Green New Deal and climate change agenda and are trying to eliminate logging in Oregon.\n\nThese are just a few of the many failures that a one-party state experiences. Instead of looking at both sides of an issue or problem, the Democrats immediately craft a new bill or law. Then they craft another bill or law in the future, trying to fix what they did earlier.\n\nI hope others hear this and see that the convenience of voting at home or vote by mail eventually costs them big bucks, wastes time, and puts into place self-important monkeys trying to fix nonexistent problems.\n\nJohn Woods: Father, Husband, Conservative, Activist, Patriot, Veteran, Certified Action Range Shooter, Voting Delegate to the state Oregon Republican Party.\n\nImage: Ben Schumin via Flickr, CC BY-SA 2.0."}

Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio.\n\nA top Korean Elliott Wave expert has forecasted that XRP may move between $10 and $40 over the next few months, which reflects possible gains of as much as 1,726% from current market levels.\n\nXForceGlobal, Korea’s first ever certified Elliott Wave analyst, is of the view that the cryptocurrency has entered the completion phase of its correction cycle and now stands ready to go into a big bull run.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum To Hit $5k Before Its 10th Birthday, Justin Sun Says 3 weeks ago\n\nTechnical Pattern Signals End Of Downward Trend\n\nXRP has completed what technical analysts term a “WXY corrective pattern” as per XForceGlobal. The technical pattern has often indicated that a period of a pullback is concluding.\n\nThe analyst said Wave W was the initial response of the market to profit-taking once XRP had risen six times in price. Wave X momentarily picked up the upward trend with minimal momentum before Wave Y concluded the correction with another orderly downward trajectory.\n\nThe cryptocurrency fell approximately 50% from its January 2025 peak of $3.33 to a low of $1.638. However, it has since rebounded by 34% to trade at $2.20 at the time of reporting.\n\n$XRP We’ve been calling for this exact pullback for months. We are inching that much closer to a historic breakout to $10+. Progress may be gradual, but it’s undeniable. https://t.co/QxWbJRPhMq pic.twitter.com/9lbnZjaTHz — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) April 24, 2025\n\nPrice Targets Range From $10 To $40\n\nXForceGlobal’s analysis puts XRP in wave 2 of a bigger fifth wave, indicating the next big move would be a strong wave 3. The analyst has had a minimum target of $10, which would be a 350% rise from current levels. His upper target of $40 would be an unprecedented 1,726% rise.\n\nThe prediction relies on Elliott Wave Theory, which tries to foresee market movements through patterns of investor sentiment expressing themselves in price waves. The predictions rely on the strength and expansion of waves 3 and 5 within the overall structure of the market.\n\nKorean Markets Act As Leading Indicators\n\nXForceGlobal pointed out that Korean cryptocurrency exchanges play a vital role in the prediction of XRP price fluctuations. In the opinion of the analyst, Korean markets have in the past led in the recognition of significant XRP tops and bottoms.\n\nThe similarity between XRP’s Korean won (KRW) chart and its US dollar chart was highlighted as especially significant. “We’re seeing the same structure on both charts. That adds conviction that wave 2 may be complete,” the analyst said.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nInvestment Strategy Recommendations\n\nAlthough the recent 40% advance from lows is the current state, XForceGlobal described recent short-term decline as typical market action. The analyst indicated that “smart money” is already accumulating in XRP as retail interest starts coming back.\n\nXForceGlobal compared the strength of XRP’s community against the reported dwindling enthusiasm for Ethereum and Solana. The last stage of this cycle might involve a vertical, parabolic price action, perhaps initiating a new wave of FOMO among investors.\n\nFeatured image from CoinFlip, chart from TradingView"}

Rubio told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” host Kristen Welker that the administration deported the mothers who entered the U.S. illegally from Honduras, and not the children.\n\n“On the headline, that’s a misleading headline,” Rubio said. “Three U.S. citizens ages 4, 7 and 2 were not deported. Their mothers who were illegally in this country were deported. The children went with their mothers. The children are U.S. citizens, they can come back into the United States if their father, or someone here, wants to assume them. But, ultimately who was deported was their mothers who were here illegally. The children just went with their mothers. It’s not like, you guys make it sound like ICE agents kicked down the door and grabbed the 2-year-old and threw him on an airplane. That’s misleading. That’s just not true.” (RELATED: Karoline Leavitt Pressed On What Trump Admin Will Do To Increase Mass Deportations)\n\nWATCH:\n\nSeveral outlets, including The Associated Press, The Washington Post, The Guardian and NPR all published headlines stating that the administration deported the U.S. citizens. A family lawyer said that the 4-year-old child, who reportedly has Stage 4 cancer, boarded the plane without medication or the ability to contact a doctor, according to The Washington Post.\n\nRubio said that if President Donald Trump’s administration had forced the children to stay in the U.S., the media would accused them of holding young children “hostage.” He clarified that the children are allowed to remain in the U.S. given their citizenship status.\n\n“If someone is in this country unlawfully, illegally, that person gets deported,” Rubio continued. “If that person is with a 2-year-old child or has a 2-year-old child says ‘I want to take my child with me,’ well then you have two choices. You can say, ‘yes, of course you can take your child whether they’re a citizen or not because it’s your child,’ or you can say, ‘yes, you can go. But your child must stay behind.’ And then your headlines would read, ‘U.S. holding hostage [a] 2-year-old, 4-year-old, 7-year-old, while mother deported.’ So, the parents make that choice.”\n\nSome Democrats and left-wing pundits have expressed fear that the Trump administration may deport U.S. citizens, which would be a blatant violation of the U.S. Constitution. The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship to all individuals born on U.S. soil, which cannot be revoked.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, ending birthright citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants with only temporary legal status. After a federal judge struck down the order, the case was then brought to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is slated to deliberate the legality of the executive order.\n\nDemocrats have accused the administration of violating the rule of law by allegedly deporting certain illegal immigrants without due process. Four congressional Democrats, along with Democratic Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, traveled to El Salvador to meet with alleged MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported back to his native country in March.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

A poll conducted by ABC News, The Washington Post and Ipsos found that 72% of Americans believe it is “likely” that President Donald Trump’s tariffs will cause a recession.\n\n“When I look at some of the things that are being published, there was a story 10 days ago that said, ‘this is the worst April for the stock market since the Great Depression.’ Ten days later, the NASDAQ is now up in the month of April, and I haven’t seen a story that says, ‘oh, the stock market has seen [its] biggest bounce back ever.’ So, I think a lot of this is media driven,” Bessent said on ABC’s “This Week.” (RELATED: Charles Payne Asks Peter Navarro If He Is Being Pushed Aside On Tariff Decisions)\n\nWATCH:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal issued a stark warning about the stock market in its April 21 piece, “Dow Headed for Worst April Since 1932 as Investor Sent ‘No Confidence’ Signal,” stating that Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by almost 1,000 points. The article further stated that the S&P 500’s performance since Jan. 20 is the worst for any president since 1928.\n\nAfter an plunge April 21, the stock market surged 1,016.57 points, or 2.66% the following day while the S&P 500 and NASDAQ rose 2.51% and 2.71%. The market continued to bounce back throughout the remainder of the week, with the S&P 500 and NASDAQ gaining 4.6% and 6.7% by Friday, according to CNBC.\n\nThe markets rose April 22 when Bessent said there will be a “de-escalation” in Trump’s trade war with China, according to CNBC. After Trump’s initial tariff announcement on April 2, the U.S. entered a trade war with China after the country retaliated with steep tariffs of its own, causing the nation to face tariffs of up to 245%, the White House said April 15.\n\nBy April 9, Trump said he would raise the tariffs on China from 104% to 125% after he had implemented a 90-day pause on every other country to leave room for negotiations. The next day, Trump announced that the tariff rate would rise to a minimum of 145% on all Chinese tariffs, according to The New York Times.\n\nTrump said Tuesday that the U.S. intends to ease tariffs on China “substantially,” though they will not be eliminated completely. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on April 23 that that there will be “no unilateral reduction in tariffs” on China, stating that the country must negotiate with the U.S.\n\nTrump said he has negotiated over 200 trade deals with foreign countries following the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But if you try your hand at stock picking, you risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Alliance Aviation Services Limited (ASX:AQZ) shareholders, since the share price is down 31% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 16%.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nAlthough the share price is down over three years, Alliance Aviation Services actually managed to grow EPS by 120% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.\n\nSince the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.\n\nWe note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 25% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. This analysis is just perfunctory, but it might be worth researching Alliance Aviation Services more closely, as sometimes stocks fall unfairly. This could present an opportunity.\n\nYou can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nASX:AQZ Earnings and Revenue Growth April 27th 2025\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Alliance Aviation Services stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWhile the broader market gained around 7.6% in the last year, Alliance Aviation Services shareholders lost 16%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 5%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Alliance Aviation Services that you should be aware of before investing here."}

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nLatest reports from the IMF reveal that economic gains from artificial intelligence are likely to outweigh the costs of rising carbon emissions from the data centers needed to run AI models. The report, released at the IMF’s annual spring meeting in Washington, revealed how artificial intelligence is going to boost global output by around 0.5% a year between 2025 and 2030. At the same time, it also noted how these output gains will not be shared equally worldwide.\n\nREAD NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks Making Headlines Today and Top 10 AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week\n\n\"Despite challenges related to higher electricity prices and greenhouse gas emissions, the gains to global GDP from AI are likely to outweigh the cost of the additional emissions. The social cost of these extra emissions is minor compared with the expected economic gains from AI, yet it still adds to the worrisome buildup of emissions”.\n\nConsidering that energy policies remain the same and artificial intelligence use becomes widespread, greenhouse gas emissions will see a cumulative global increase of 1.2% between 2025 and 2030. However, a switch to greener energy policies would limit the increase to 1.3 Gt.\n\nQuantifying the social cost of these emissions, the report calculated that the extra cost is likely to be at $50.7-$66.3 billion, which is smaller than the income gains that can help boost the economy by 0.5% each year through AI.\n\nAccording to the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, AI may even be able to generate an overall reduction in carbon emissions if it accelerates advances in low-carbon technologies in the power, food, and transport sectors.\n\n\"But market forces alone are unlikely to successfully drive AI's application toward climate action. Governments, tech companies and energy companies must play an active role in ensuring AI is used intentionally, equitably and sustainably.”\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here)."}

The ex-dividend date is commonly two business days before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, VAT Group investors that purchase the stock on or after the 2nd of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 6th of May.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be CHF06.25 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed CHF6.25 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that VAT Group has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current share price of CHF0294.90. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether VAT Group has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Its dividend payout ratio is 88% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. We'd be worried about the risk of a drop in earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 101% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.\n\nVAT Group paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were VAT Group to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for VAT Group"}

See what we found for Galenica in our free report.\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Galenica AG (VTX:GALE), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 55% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nAnd institutions on the other hand have a 44% ownership in the company. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Galenica.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Galenica\n\nSWX:GALE Ownership Breakdown April 27th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Galenica?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Galenica. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Galenica, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nSWX:GALE Earnings and Revenue Growth April 27th 2025\n\nGalenica is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is UBS Asset Management AG, with ownership of 11%. Alecta Pensionsförsäkring, ömsesidigt is the second largest shareholder owning 4.0% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 3.9% of the company stock.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too."}

You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Fundamenta Real Estate the TSR over the last 3 years was -4.6%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Fundamenta Real Estate shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 7.6% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 5% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Fundamenta Real Estate (including 2 which can't be ignored) ."}

This tendency has been evident during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. These developments, along with the growing number of military conflicts worldwide (Ukraine, Israel, etc.), have led to the fast development of new cyber threats and numerous information security issues exploited by cybercriminals. The inability to provide trusted, secure services in contemporary computer network technologies has a tremendous socio-economic impact on global enterprises and individuals. Moreover, the frequently occurring international frauds impose the necessity to conduct investigations spanning multiple domains and countries. Such examination is often subject to different jurisdictions and legal systems. A good illustration of the above is the Internet, which has made it easier to prepare and perpetrate traditional - but now cyber-enabled - crimes. It has acted as an alternate avenue for criminals to conduct their activities and launch attacks with relative anonymity, a high degree of deniability, and the opportunity to operate in a border-agnostic environment. Worrying developments in the abuse of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies lead to the increased capabilities of malign actors who leverage these tools to design and propagate disinformation, which is especially dangerous (and effective) during emergencies and crises of all kinds. The developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence have also enabled the increase of criminal capabilities in the production, dissemination, and weaponization of high-quality, convincing fake contact (text, audio, images, and videos), which translates not only to the truth and trust decay among the affected societies but also to the enhanced capabilities in orchestrating the sophisticated cyber crimes. Furthermore, nowadays, the majority of life-science-based techniques and resulting data hinge on information technologies. Despite their considerable advantages, dependence on cyber technologies also exposes vulnerabilities. Various threats in the digital realm could target biomedical systems, leading to adverse consequences. The field of CyberBioSecurity was established to assist bio-related sciences in comprehending potential cyber threats and formulating defense approaches, recovery protocols, and resilience strategies. The increased complexity of communications and the networking infrastructure is making the investigation of these new types of crimes difficult. Traces of illegal digital activities are difficult to analyze due to large volumes of data. Nowadays, the digital crime scene functions like any other network, with dedicated administrators functioning as the first responders. This poses new challenges for law enforcement and intelligence communities and forces computer societies to utilize digital forensics to combat the increasing number of cyber crimes. Forensic professionals must be fully prepared to provide court-admissible evidence. Forensic techniques should keep pace with new technologies to make these goals achievable. Prevention, mitigation, and interdiction of new and emerging threats necessitate an increasingly thorough and multidisciplinary approach. They also require the collaboration of all relevant actors and stakeholders in designing the technology regulation and cyber governance measures. The aim of this workshop is to bring together the research outcomes provided by researchers from academia and the industry. Another goal is to showcase the latest research findings across a wide range of topics, from digital forensics to cyberbiosecurity. We strongly encourage prospective authors to submit articles presenting both theoretical approaches and practical case reviews, including work-in-progress reports. TOPICS OF INTEREST INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: - Big Data analytics helping to track cyber crimes - Protecting Big Data / AI models against cyber crimes - Crime-as-a-service - Criminal abuse of clouds and social networks - Criminal to criminal (C2C) communications - Criminal to victim (C2V) communications - Criminal use of IoT, e.g., IoT-based botnets - Cyberbiosecurity - Cyber crime-related investigations - Cyber crimes: evolution, new trends and detection - Darknets and hidden services - Fake (incl. deepfake) and disinformation detection - Generative Artificial Intelligence and cyber crime - AI-enabled crime and terrorism - Mobile malware - Network anomalies detection - Network traffic analysis, traceback and attribution - Incident response, investigation and evidence handling - Internet governance - Novel techniques in exploit kits - Political and business issues related to digital forensics and anti-forensic techniques - Anti-forensic techniques and methods - Identification, authentication and collection of digital evidence - Integrity of digital evidence and live investigations - Privacy issues in digital forensics - Ransomware: evolution, functioning, types, etc. - Steganography/steganalysis and covert/subliminal channels - Technology regulation - Novel applications of information hiding in networks - Watermarking and intellectual property theft - Weaponization of information - cyber-enhanced disinformation campaigns WORKSHOP CHAIRS Artur Janicki, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland; Kacper Gradoń, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland; Katarzyna Kamińska, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland SUBMISSION GUIDELINES The submission guidelines valid for the workshop are the same as for the ARES conference.

His blog, erickimphotography.com, is often the top result for “street photography” on Google, achieved through over 14 years of daily posting and more than 5,000 articles. This visibility has made him a central figure for beginners and professionals alike, offering a wealth of free resources like e-books, contact sheets, RAW files, and Lightroom presets, accessible without email sign-ups.\n\nHis workshops, priced between $1,500 and $2,500, sell out across five continents, from Chicago to Sydney, highlighting his global reach and demand as an educator. Additionally, through Haptic Industries, he has built a micro-brand ecosystem selling photography products, showcasing his entrepreneurial success.\n\nCommunity and Engagement\n\nEric Kim’s online presence is substantial, with around 100,000 YouTube subscribers and millions of views on tutorial videos, alongside his blog’s extensive archive. He is credited with promoting street photography online, though he is a polarizing figure—some praise his advocacy, while others label him controversial. This mix keeps his name circulating, ensuring he remains a topic of discussion. His approach integrates Stoic philosophy, fitness, and entrepreneurship, offering a lifestyle blueprint that sets him apart from technically focused tutors.\n\nAchievements and Output\n\nWith over 9,000 blog posts and 100,000 candid photographs, Eric Kim’s consistency is unmatched. He has collaborated with major brands like Leica and Magnum, taught at UC Riverside Extension, and judged events like the London Street Photography Festival. His work has been exhibited in Leica stores in cities like Singapore and Seoul, further solidifying his influence.\n\nCriticisms and Controversy\n\nWhile highly praised, some critics view his blog as a “marketing machine,” questioning his authenticity and suggesting he focuses more on promotion than developing his own photographic style. However, even detractors acknowledge he drives the conversation in street photography, and his transparency about blogging’s self-interested nature adds authenticity.\n\nSurvey Note: Detailed Analysis of Eric Kim’s Status as a Photography Blogger\n\nEric Kim’s reputation as potentially the best photography blogger of all time is rooted in a combination of his extensive online presence, educational contributions, entrepreneurial ventures, and community engagement. This analysis, conducted on April 27, 2025, draws from a comprehensive review of available information to explore the reasons behind his standing, acknowledging both accolades and criticisms.\n\nDominance in Search and Online Visibility\n\nEric Kim’s blog, erickimphotography.com, holds a dominant position in search engine results, particularly for “street photography.” This is attributed to his 14-year commitment to daily posting, resulting in over 5,000 articles. His strategic use of SEO and niche authority has made his site the first organic result on Google for street photography searches, effectively framing the conversation for an entire genre. This visibility is crucial for beginners, positioning him as the go-to resource.\n\nHis online footprint extends to YouTube, where he maintains around 100,000 subscribers, with tutorial videos accumulating millions of views. This “sticky” presence ensures his content reaches a broad audience, reinforcing his influence.\n\nGenerosity with Educational Resources\n\nA hallmark of Eric Kim’s approach is his generosity with free content. He offers dozens of e-books, contact sheets, RAW files, and Lightroom presets through his “street-photography starter kit” download hub, accessible without requiring an email sign-up. This open-source ethos contrasts with many educators who gatekeep knowledge, making his resources widely accessible and fostering a sense of community. This strategy has likely contributed to his reputation as a trusted figure among photographers.\n\nGlobal Workshops and High Demand\n\nEric Kim’s workshops are a testament to his educational impact, selling out on five continents with prices ranging from $1,500 to $2,500 for a weekend. Past workshops, documented with “SOLD OUT” banners, have been held in cities like Chicago, Sydney, and Tokyo, reflecting his global appeal. This demand underscores his reputation as an exceptional educator, capable of attracting participants worldwide.\n\nEntrepreneurial Success and Brand Ecosystem\n\nBeyond blogging, Eric Kim has expanded his influence through Haptic Industries, a micro-brand that designs and sells photography-related products such as camera straps, bags, and minimalist zines. This vertical integration demonstrates his ability to turn his blog into a profitable business without relying on external capital, offering a model for creative entrepreneurs. His entrepreneurial hustle, combined with his blogging, sets him apart as a multifaceted figure in the photography space.\n\nCommunity Engagement and Polarizing Presence\n\nEric Kim is credited with “instrumental” promotion of street photography online, making the genre more accessible to newcomers. However, he is also a polarizing figure, with peers and critics labeling him controversial. Some view him as an evangelist, while others see him as a lightning rod for debate. This polarization, detailed in The Philosophy of ERIC KIM, keeps his name circulating, ensuring he remains a topic of discussion. Even detractors admit he drives the conversation, which keeps newbies grateful and engaged.\n\nHis community-building efforts are evident in his blog’s extensive archive and social media presence, fostering a sense of belonging among photographers. His ability to connect with both amateur and professional audiences through workshops and online content has solidified his role as a central figure in the photography blogging ecosystem.\n\nHolistic Approach: Philosophy, Fitness, and Entrepreneurship\n\nEric Kim’s content goes beyond technical photography tips, integrating Stoic philosophy, Spartan fitness, and open-source ideals into a meta-narrative. This holistic approach, as outlined in The Philosophy of ERIC KIM, offers creatives a lifestyle blueprint, differentiating him from tutors focused solely on camera techniques. For example, he treats photography as “poetry with light,” a meditative practice that explores life and beauty, encouraging readers to carry a camera everywhere and frame scenes like thoughts.\n\nThis integration appeals to a broader audience seeking personal growth alongside artistic development, enhancing his appeal as a thought leader.\n\nAchievements and Output Metrics\n\nEric Kim’s output is staggering, with over 9,000 blog posts and 100,000 candid photographs, as noted in various profiles. His consistency, posting 1-2 times daily for years, is a benchmark in the blogging space. Financially, he claims to make over $200,000 annually from blogging, as mentioned in PHOTOGRAPHY BLOGGING 101, further highlighting his success.\n\nHis collaborations with major brands like Leica and Magnum, teaching roles at UC Riverside Extension, and judging positions at events like the London Street Photography Festival add to his credentials. Exhibitions at Leica stores in Singapore, Seoul, and Melbourne, as detailed in Eric Kim | Photographer | All About Photo, underscore his influence in the professional photography world.\n\nCriticisms and Controversies\n\nDespite his accolades, Eric Kim faces criticism, as seen in an article titled “Is Eric Kim full of sh*t?” on OnEdgeStreet. Critics argue his blog is more of a “marketing machine,” suggesting he focuses on self-promotion rather than developing his own photographic style. Some claim he shoots in film during classes to avoid showing his work, and others question whether he recites the greats without offering original insights. Comments on the article reflect a divide, with some agreeing he prioritizes SEO and sales over art, while others defend his right to monetize and suggest readers can choose what to take from his content.\n\nEric Kim himself acknowledges potential biases in blogging, as seen in DON’T TRUST PHOTOGRAPHY BLOGGERS (especially ERIC KIM), where he admits to self-interest, such as affiliate links and brand collaborations. This transparency may mitigate some criticism, but it also fuels debate about authenticity.\n\nComparative Context and Longevity\n\nEric Kim’s longevity, with over a decade of consistent blogging, sets him apart from many peers who may falter after initial efforts. His advice, as seen in How to Make a Living With Blogging, emphasizes survival and inspiration, suggesting the difference between success and failure is persistence. This aligns with his own journey, making him a model for aspiring bloggers.\n\nCompared to other photography bloggers, his combination of reach, free value, and premium offerings (workshops, products) is rare. While some may offer technical depth, few match his holistic approach and global community engagement.\n\nConclusion\n\nEric Kim’s status as the best photography blogger of all time is supported by his dominant online presence, extensive free resources, high-demand workshops, entrepreneurial success, and unique integration of philosophy and lifestyle. His influence in street photography is unmatched, with over 9,000 blog posts, 100,000 candid photographs, and a global following. While criticisms exist, particularly around authenticity and marketing, the evidence leans toward his significant positive impact, making him a central figure in the photography blogging community as of April 27, 2025.\n\nKey Citations"}
