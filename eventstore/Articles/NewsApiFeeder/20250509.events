In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Chris Rokos' other stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nOne of the traits that define investors who become billionaires is the ability to make money regardless of market conditions. Chris Rokos is one example. For instance, in March 2025, the hedge fund gained 3.4% amid heightened volatility. At the same time, fellow big-name asset managers like Point72, Citadel, and Millennium struggled to handle the volatility.\n\nChristopher Charles Rokos is a British hedge fund manager. He co-founded Brevan Howard in 2002 after nearly 10 years with Goldman Sachs, where he traded interest rate products. In 2015, he established Rokos Capital Management. The asset manager has approximately $20 billion worth of assets under management (AUM) as of 2025. Rokos is the fund‚Äôs Chief Investment Officer (CIO).\n\nThe billionaire hedge fund manager made the most of Trump‚Äôs election in November last year. According to a Bloomberg report, Rokos netted nearly $1 billion in profits in a single day following Trump‚Äôs victory. This, according to the report, is a ‚Äústandout trading performance‚Äù since Rokos Capital started operating in 2015.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire Ray Dalio‚Äôs Bridgewater‚Äôs 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential and Billionaire Mario Gabelli‚Äôs 10 Large-Cap Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential.\n\nAnd the winning didn‚Äôt stop there. Since that election victory, Trump has fueled rallies and routs in almost equal measure. But, interestingly, Rokos keeps turning up profits regardless of market conditions. Thanks to the Trump-fueled rally in November 2024, Rokos Capital Management ended the year with 31% in returns.\n\nIn early April 2025, Trump‚Äôs tariffs triggered a large sell-off, and many hedge funds lost money. But not Rokos. The asset manager advanced 4.5% in the first two weeks of the month. This gain helped the hedge fund‚Äôs returns for the year to reach 8% as of mid-April 2025.\n\nBut whether Rokos Capital Management will keep winning this year is something that remains to be seen, especially in light of the conditions in the market. On Monday, May 5, 2025, the S&P 500 snapped out of a nine-day rally‚Äîthe longest winning streak in 20 years. The broader market index fell 0.64%, while the Nasdaq shed 0.74% and the Dow lost 0.24%.\n\nMarket observers quoted by CNN put the decline on tariffs. For instance, Argent Capital Management‚Äôs Jed Ellerbroek said that the ‚Äúmarket is intensely focused on where the tariff rates end up, and it‚Äôs bouncing around day to day as those assessments change.‚Äù"}

AWS revenue jumped 16.9% year over year in the most recent quarter, while its operating income rose 22.6%. AWS has now surpassed a $100 billion annual run rate, playing a central role in helping businesses modernize infrastructure, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation.\n\nThe market often overlooks Amazon‚Äôs ads business, which is generating more than $10 billion in quarterly revenue despite being built from scratch. In the first quarter, ad revenue rose 19% from a year earlier to $13.9 billion, continuing to support overall profitability."}

Grease two 9-inch cake pans, and line with waxed paper. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. In another mixing bowl, cream the butter until light, add the 3/4 cup of sugar and mix well. Add the orange rind to the creamed mixture. Stir the orange juice and rum together, and add to the creamed mixture alternately with the dry ingredients. Add the almond and vanilla extracts and the walnuts. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Add the 1/4 cup of sugar and beat until stiff peaks are formed. Fold the egg whites into the batter, pour into pans and bake for 25 minutes. Cool 10 minutes, then remove from the pans. Notes: I used the peel from 1 whole orange, and juiced it to get the 1/2 cup of juice. There was no frosting recipe, so I made a half-recipe of this Cream Cheese Icing: cream together 8 ounces of softened cream cheese and 1/2 cup (1 cube) of softened butter of margarine. Sift a 16-ounce box of powdered sugar and add to the creamed mixture. Beat until light. Stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Makes enough icing for a 3-layer cake. (This cake needed only 4 ounces cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 8 ounces of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.)\n\n(Thanks, Dorothy.)"}

Jones, who shot to fame on profiting from the 1987 market crash, has etched his name on Wall Street owing to his extraordinary ability to foresee market shifts and try to capitalize on them.\n\nThe tariff war has put the US central bank in a tight spot as it tries to balance interest rates amid a tariff war likely to spark inflation. The US Federal Reserve has had to keep its key overnight lending rate steady since December, on growing concerns that the trade war will trigger a significant spike in inflation. Fed chair Jerome Powell, insisting that policymakers wait for greater clarity, has not only rattled the markets but also triggered a backlash from the US president.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôll dial it back to 50% or 40%, whatever. Even when he does that ... it‚Äôd be the largest tax increases since the ‚Äô60s,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúSo you can kind of take 2%, 3% off growth.‚Äù\n\nThe remarks come on Trump slapping 145% tariffs on imported Chinese goods as one of the ways of getting Beijing into the negotiation table. While the administration has hinted at the possibility of dialing it back to about 50% or 40%, Jones insists it will be too little too late.\n\n‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs pretty clear. You have Trump who‚Äôs locked in on tariffs. You have the Fed who‚Äôs locked in on not cutting rates. That‚Äôs not good for the stock market,‚Äù Jones said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll probably go down to new lows, even when Trump dials back China to 50%.‚Äù\n\nThe hedge fund manager insists stocks are bound to hit new lows even on Trump toning down on aggressive tariffs on China. That‚Äôs because macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate.\n\nIt‚Äôs all gloomy regardless of what US President Donald Trump does. That‚Äôs the sentiment echoed by billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones, who is taking issue with the aggressive tariffs aimed at settling the trade deficit between the US and its trading partners. While the US markets have pulled back by up to 8% in response to the tariff war woes, Jones believes the dust is unlikely to settle anytime soon.\n\nWe recently published an article titled Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' 10 Stocks Picks with Huge Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Paul Tudor Jones' other stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nStory Continues\n\nJones has constantly reiterated the need to concentrate on risk management and protecting current investments during heightened market volatility. Instead of daydreaming about possible gains, he advises investors to spend 90% of their time considering the cash at risk in their investments.\n\n‚ÄúPeople need to focus on the money that they have at risk and how much capital is at risk in any single investment they have. If everyone spent 90% of their time on that, not 90% of the time on pie-in-the-sky ideas of how much money they're going to make, then they would be incredibly successful investors,‚Äù Jones said.\n\nTudor Investment Corporation, founded in 1980, is the investment firm that the hedge fund manager uses to pursue opportunities in the equity markets while leveraging solid risk management strategies. The firm has generated an average return of 19% over the years, affirming a solid stock-picking strategy. With that, let's take a look at the firm's top stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe combed Tudor Investment Corporation Q4 2024 13F filings to identify Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' 10 Stocks Picks with Huge Upside Potential. We then settled on stocks with more than 30% upside potential based on analysts ratings and analyzed why the stocks stand out, as solid value investments well poised to generate significant long term value. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the stocks upside potential (as of May 7). We have also mentioned the broader hedge fund sentiment for these stocks, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) ‚Äì Datacenter Growth Offers Huge Upside Potential\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nTudor Investment Corporation Equity Stake: $116.39 Million\n\nStock Upside Potential as of May 7: 44.65%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 223\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor giant that designs and manufactures graphic processing units and related technologies at the heart of artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. While the stock has pulled back significantly from its record highs, it is one billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' 10 stock picks with huge upside potential amid the artificial intelligence frenzy.\n\nAlthough NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has dominated the semiconductor sector with its GPUs for powering AI models, its stock has received a rare Sell rating from Seaport Global Securities analyst Jay Goldberg. The Sell rating comes amid growing concerns that the company will feel the full brunt of recent export restrictions targeting China. Nevertheless, the analyst insists Nvidia remains the dominant player in developing advanced chips and is not at risk of losing its market-leading position.\n\nHowever, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) plans to launch a downgraded H20 AI chip for China in July, following U.S. export restrictions on the original model. The company aims to retain its market presence despite tighter semiconductor regulations. The modified H20 will have reduced memory capacity, though customers may adjust its performance. Nvidia‚Äôs China sales totaled $17B, or 13% of its revenue, in the fiscal year ended January 26.\n\nFor investors who believe in the AI opportunity overall, the company is a long-term play because of its strong position in both market share and innovation, which should help it overcome short-term obstacles. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has already reiterated that the market for AI chips is poised to reach $50 billion in China, insisting that the company should have access to the country.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of Paul Tudor Jones' stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) ‚Ä¶ [+6887 chars]", "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Among Paul Tudor Jones‚Äô Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential", "fullContent": "Amid the headwinds and uncertainties, Jones has positioned his portfolio to benefit from any bounce back once the selloff dust settles. Jones, who shot to fame on profiting from the 1987 market crash, has etched his name on Wall Street owing to his extraordinary ability to foresee market shifts and try to capitalize on them.\n\nThe tariff war has put the US central bank in a tight spot as it tries to balance interest rates amid a tariff war likely to spark inflation. The US Federal Reserve has had to keep its key overnight lending rate steady since December, on growing concerns that the trade war will trigger a significant spike in inflation. Fed chair Jerome Powell, insisting that policymakers wait for greater clarity, has not only rattled the markets but also triggered a backlash from the US president.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôll dial it back to 50% or 40%, whatever. Even when he does that ... it‚Äôd be the largest tax increases since the ‚Äô60s,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúSo you can kind of take 2%, 3% off growth.‚Äù\n\nThe remarks come on Trump slapping 145% tariffs on imported Chinese goods as one of the ways of getting Beijing into the negotiation table. While the administration has hinted at the possibility of dialing it back to about 50% or 40%, Jones insists it will be too little too late.\n\n‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs pretty clear. You have Trump who‚Äôs locked in on tariffs. You have the Fed who‚Äôs locked in on not cutting rates. That‚Äôs not good for the stock market,‚Äù Jones said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll probably go down to new lows, even when Trump dials back China to 50%.‚Äù\n\nThe hedge fund manager insists stocks are bound to hit new lows even on Trump toning down on aggressive tariffs on China. That‚Äôs because macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate.\n\nIt‚Äôs all gloomy regardless of what US President Donald Trump does. That‚Äôs the sentiment echoed by billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones, who is taking issue with the aggressive tariffs aimed at settling the trade deficit between the US and its trading partners. While the US markets have pulled back by up to 8% in response to the tariff war woes, Jones believes the dust is unlikely to settle anytime soon.\n\nWe recently published an article titled Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' 10 Stocks Picks with Huge Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Paul Tudor Jones' other stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nStory Continues\n\nJones has constantly reiterated the need to concentrate on risk management and protecting current investments during heightened market volatility. Instead of daydreaming about possible gains, he advises investors to spend 90% of their time considering the cash at risk in their investments.\n\n‚ÄúPeople need to focus on the money that they have at risk and how much capital is at risk in any single investment they have. If everyone spent 90% of their time on that, not 90% of the time on pie-in-the-sky ideas of how much money they're going to make, then they would be incredibly successful investors,‚Äù Jones said.\n\nTudor Investment Corporation, founded in 1980, is the investment firm that the hedge fund manager uses to pursue opportunities in the equity markets while leveraging solid risk management strategies. The firm has generated an average return of 19% over the years, affirming a solid stock-picking strategy. With that, let's take a look at the firm's top stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe combed Tudor Investment Corporation Q4 2024 13F filings to identify Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' 10 Stocks Picks with Huge Upside Potential. We then settled on stocks with more than 30% upside potential based on analysts ratings and analyzed why the stocks stand out, as solid value investments well poised to generate significant long term value. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the stocks upside potential (as of May 7). We have also mentioned the broader hedge fund sentiment for these stocks, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Among Stocks That Will Make You Rich In 3 Years\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nTudor Investment Corporation Equity Stake: $112.92 Million\n\nStock Upside Potential as of May 7: 30.58%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 338\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' 10 stock picks with huge upside potential owing to its diversified business empire. While the company is a market leader in e-commerce, it‚Äôs also flexing its muscle in the multibillion cloud computing and advertising segments. On May 2, UBS reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but cut the price target to $249 from $253.\n\nThe price cut comes against the backdrop of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) being vulnerable to trade tariffs as it maintains significant operations in China and abroad. Nevertheless, the tech giant delivered impressive first-quarter 2025 results characterized by a 9% revenue increase to $155.7 billion. North America continues to account for the biggest share of the company‚Äôs revenue at $92.9 billion, up 8% year over year.\n\nAmid the challenging macro environment, Amazon.com, Inc.‚Äôs (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q1 2025 net income increased to $17.1 billion or $1.59 a share compared to $10.4 billion or $0.98 a share a year ago. Advertising revenue, rising by 19%, emerged as a key profit driver. The company‚Äôs investments in the cloud computing unit are increasingly paying off as more businesses turn to it for AI needs. Amazon's management anticipates that both retail and AWS will continue to grow, although they have noted ongoing uncertainty due to possible new tariffs and macroeconomic turbulence. Consequently, it prioritizes inventory planning, supply chain flexibility, and AI technology investments.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 10th on our list of Paul Tudor Jones' stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, adjusted EPS was $0.12, surpassing expectations, with adjusted EBITDA of $81 million and a 14% EBITDA margin.\n\nThe company reaffirmed its full-year 2025 guidance, projecting total net revenue growth of approximately 8% and adjusted EBITDA between $410 million and $460 million.\n\nFollowing the earnings release, Stagwell‚Äôs stock initially rose 6% in premarket trading but later dropped by about 15% during regular trading hours.\n\nPenn said AI and digital transformation would play a pivotal role in Stagwell‚Äôs future. In April, the company appointed John Kahan, a veteran of Microsoft and IBM, as its inaugural chief AI officer.\n\nStagwell has been integrating AI more deeply into its offerings over the past year. This includes building out its PRophet Comms Tech Suite, which uses AI to help predict media interest and craft more effective pitches. Its machine learning suite also features tools that track earned media coverage for clients and an influencer matchmaking tool.\n\nStagwell‚Äôs Q1 performance contrasts with some competitors. Omnicom reported 1.6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 2025, while Interpublic Group (IPG) saw a 5.9% decline.\n\nAddressing investors during Stagwell‚Äôs earnings call, Penn expressed skepticism about industry consolidation: ‚ÄúWhile others in the industry are flailing about with endless reorganizations, behemoth mergers, and downsizing, Stagwell is on a steady course of growth, scale, and innovation.‚Äù"}

They were able to bypass authentication protection and gain shell access to the routers.\n\nOnce access to the routers was gained, the cybercriminal installed malware and used the routers in a bot network (botnet) they control to launch coordinated attacks or sell access to the devices as proxy services.\n\nThe malware communicated with a command-and-control (C2) server controlled by the threat actor through a two-way handshake between the server and the routers. The C2 server also performed regular check-ins with the routers and opened ports to make them available to users as proxy servers.\n\nThese services, associated with the Anyproxy and 5Socks proxy networks, could then be utilized by other cybercriminals to conceal their tracks while engaging in illicit activities online.\n\nWhile the FBI did not make any attribution at this time, the advisory noted, ‚ÄúChinese cyber actors are also among those who have taken advantage of known vulnerabilities in end-of-life routers or other edge devices to establish botnets used to conceal hacking into US critical infrastructure.‚Äù\n\nRead more: Chinese Hackers Implant Backdoor Malware on Juniper Routers\n\nFBI Recommends Upgrading Routers to Newer Models\n\n‚ÄúSince the malware is router-based, it is difficult for an end user to know if their device is compromised due to the inability of antivirus tools to scan these devices,‚Äù noted the FBI.\n\nTherefore, the Bureau advised replacing any routers vulnerable to known flaws with newer models or else disabling the remote administration of the said routers and rebooting them.\n\nOpenEoX: Standardizing End-of-Life Disclosures\n\nThis FBI advisory comes a few days after a coalition of major tech vendors, including Cisco, Microsoft and IBM published a new update on ‚ÄòOpenEoX,‚Äô a framework supported by the OASIS Open consortium to standardize the way companies announce when their products will no longer receive security patches or support.\n\nThe draft standard, released through the OASIS standards body, aims to address the issue of end-of-life notices being scattered, inconsistently worded and hard to track, which can cause significant problems for organizations running outdated software or hardware.\n\nThe OpenEoX framework proposes a shared data format that can be integrated into software bills of materials (SBOMs), security advisories and other cybersecurity documents."}

At the time, it was estimated that limiting the provision would temporarily raise about $120 billion from 2018 to 2027.\n\n‚ÄúA lot of those announcements are predicated on an expectation the administration and Congress will partner together on reinstating those R&D provisions,‚Äù said Jason Oxman, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that includes among its members Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Anthropic, Alphabet Inc., and IBM Corp.\n\nLobbyists representing tech companies that announced US investments have made similar claims to congressional aides and lawmakers, according to people familiar with the conversations. The companies behind those plans ‚Äî Apple Inc., Oracle Corp., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and TSMC ‚Äî did not respond to requests for comment on whether their investments are contingent on deducting their research and development expenses.\n\n‚ÄúEnabling R&D is essential to strengthening U.S. technology leadership, economic competitiveness, and national security,‚Äù according to a statement from Intel‚Äôs vice president for government affairs Al Thompson. ‚ÄúRestoring the R&D tax deduction will incentivize sustained investments that drive cutting-edge innovation across industries.‚Äù\n\nIn 2024, Intel invested $16.5 billion in R&D, the vast majority of which was in the US, one of the largest investments by any company.\n\nTech companies have paired those warnings with marketing pushes targeting lawmakers‚Äô districts, particularly events promoting the potential of artificial intelligence. Venture capital firms are also closely involved in the lobbying campaign."}

In the fast-evolving world of artificial intelligence, bridging the gap between AI agents and external systems is no longer a luxury‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. Enter two pivotal technologies: Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). While APIs have long been the backbone of system communication, MCP is the new contender, purpose-built for AI and large language models (LLMs). But here‚Äôs the catch: they‚Äôre not rivals. Instead, they complement each other, reshaping how developers integrate AI into dynamic, data-rich environments. The question isn‚Äôt which one to choose‚Äîit‚Äôs how to harness their combined power.\n\nIn this breakdown, IBM explore the distinct roles of MCP and APIs, uncovering how they simplify AI agent integration with external data. You‚Äôll discover why MCP‚Äôs dynamic discovery capabilities are a fantastic option for AI adaptability, and how APIs continue to provide the foundational versatility developers rely on. Along the way, we‚Äôll highlight the key differences, surprising overlaps, and practical benefits of these tools, offering a fresh perspective on their interplay. By the end, you‚Äôll see how using MCP alongside APIs can not only streamline your workflows but also future-proof your AI systems in an ever-changing tech landscape. Sometimes, the best solutions aren‚Äôt about choosing sides‚Äîthey‚Äôre about building bridges.\n\nMCP vs API\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized protocol introduced in 2024 by Anthropic, designed specifically for seamless integration of AI systems like large language models (LLMs) with external tools and data sources.\n\nMCP offers dynamic discovery capabilities, allowing AI agents to query and adapt to new tools and resources at runtime without requiring redeployment, enhancing flexibility in dynamic environments.\n\nUnlike general-purpose APIs, MCP is purpose-built for AI, providing features like runtime adaptability, standardization, and AI-optimized interfaces, making it more suitable for AI-driven applications.\n\nMCP organizes its functionality into three categories: Tools (discrete actions), Resources (read-only data access), and Prompt Templates (predefined structures for task-specific prompts), streamlining AI integration and functionality.\n\nMCP often acts as a wrapper for APIs, combining their flexibility with AI-specific optimizations, simplifying integration, and allowing scalable, efficient, and adaptable AI-driven solutions.\n\nWhat is MCP?\n\nMCP is a standardized protocol designed to enable seamless interaction between AI systems, such as LLMs, and external tools or data sources. It functions as a universal connector for AI applications, much like how a USB-C port connects various devices. Operating on a client-server model, MCP uses JSON RPC 2.0 for structured data exchange, making sure efficient and reliable communication.\n\nOne of MCP‚Äôs most notable features is its dynamic discovery capability. This allows AI agents to query available tools and resources at runtime, allowing them to integrate new functionalities without requiring redeployment. This adaptability is particularly valuable in environments where tools and resources are frequently updated or expanded. By providing a standardized framework, MCP simplifies the integration process and enhances the flexibility of AI systems.\n\nCore Capabilities of MCP\n\nMCP organizes its functionality into three primary categories, each designed to address specific integration needs:\n\nTools: These represent discrete actions or functions that AI agents can perform, such as retrieving weather data, sending emails, or scheduling events.\n\nThese represent discrete actions or functions that AI agents can perform, such as retrieving weather data, sending emails, or scheduling events. Resources: These provide read-only access to data, such as text files, database entries, or static documents, making sure that AI agents can retrieve necessary information without altering it.\n\nThese provide read-only access to data, such as text files, database entries, or static documents, making sure that AI agents can retrieve necessary information without altering it. Prompt Templates: Predefined structures that guide AI agents in generating appropriate prompts for specific tasks, improving the accuracy and relevance of their outputs.\n\nBy using these capabilities, MCP enables AI agents to dynamically adapt to new tools and resources, reducing the need for manual updates or extensive reconfiguration. This makes MCP an invaluable tool for developers working in dynamic and rapidly evolving environments.\n\nSimplifying AI Agent Integration with External Data\n\nExplore further guides and articles from our vast library that you may find relevant to your interests in Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\nWhat are APIs?\n\nAPIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are versatile interfaces that assist communication between different systems. Like MCP, APIs operate on a client-server model and often use RESTful architecture, which relies on standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. APIs are widely used across industries for tasks ranging from database queries to third-party service integrations.\n\nHowever, APIs are not specifically optimized for AI systems. For example, when an API is updated or new endpoints are introduced, developers must manually update their clients to maintain compatibility. This lack of adaptability can pose challenges in dynamic environments, particularly for AI applications that require frequent updates or new functionalities.\n\nSimilarities Between MCP and APIs\n\nDespite their differences, MCP and APIs share several fundamental similarities that make them effective tools for system integration:\n\nBoth rely on a client-server architecture to assist structured communication between systems.\n\nThey provide abstraction layers, simplifying integration by hiding the complexities of underlying implementation details.\n\nDevelopers can use both to connect systems without the need to build custom solutions from scratch, saving time and resources.\n\nThese shared principles highlight how MCP builds upon the foundational concepts of APIs while introducing enhancements specifically tailored for AI applications.\n\nKey Differences Between MCP and APIs\n\nThe distinctions between MCP and APIs lie in their purpose, design, and functionality, making each uniquely suited to specific use cases:\n\nPurpose: MCP is purpose-built for AI and LLMs, offering features optimized for these systems. APIs, on the other hand, are designed for general system-to-system communication.\n\nMCP is purpose-built for AI and LLMs, offering features optimized for these systems. APIs, on the other hand, are designed for general system-to-system communication. Dynamic Discovery: MCP enables runtime capability discovery, allowing AI agents to query and adapt to available tools and resources. APIs typically lack this feature, requiring manual updates for compatibility.\n\nMCP enables runtime capability discovery, allowing AI agents to query and adapt to available tools and resources. APIs typically lack this feature, requiring manual updates for compatibility. Standardization: MCP servers adhere to a uniform protocol, making sure consistency across implementations. In contrast, APIs vary widely in design and structure, which can complicate integration efforts.\n\nThese differences underscore MCP‚Äôs suitability for AI applications, where adaptability, standardization, and dynamic integration are critical for efficient operation.\n\nMCP as a Wrapper for APIs\n\nIn many scenarios, MCP acts as a wrapper for existing APIs, providing an AI-optimized interface while relying on APIs to perform underlying tasks. For instance, an MCP server might use APIs to interact with file systems, Google Maps, Docker, or Spotify. By serving as a translation layer, MCP abstracts the complexities of individual APIs, offering a consistent and standardized interface for AI agents to interact with diverse systems.\n\nThis approach not only simplifies the integration process but also enhances the flexibility and scalability of AI-driven solutions. Developers can use MCP to bridge the gap between AI systems and external tools, making sure seamless communication and functionality.\n\nBenefits of MCP Integration\n\nMCP offers several advantages when integrating AI agents with external systems, making it a valuable tool for developers and organizations:\n\nStandardization: MCP standardizes interactions, reducing the complexity of working with diverse services and tools.\n\nMCP standardizes interactions, reducing the complexity of working with diverse services and tools. Dynamic Adaptability: Its dynamic discovery feature allows AI agents to adapt to new tools and resources without requiring code changes or redeployment.\n\nIts dynamic discovery feature allows AI agents to adapt to new tools and resources without requiring code changes or redeployment. Enhanced Flexibility: By using APIs under the hood, MCP combines the flexibility of APIs with AI-specific optimizations, creating a more efficient integration process.\n\nThese benefits make MCP an essential component for developers aiming to enhance AI functionality while streamlining system integration. By addressing the unique challenges of AI applications, MCP enables the creation of more adaptable and scalable solutions.\n\nMaximizing the Potential of MCP and APIs\n\nMCP and APIs are complementary technologies that address different aspects of system integration. While APIs provide a versatile foundation for communication, MCP builds on this foundation to offer a standardized, AI-optimized interface. Acting as a wrapper for APIs, MCP simplifies integration and enables dynamic adaptability, making it an indispensable tool for modern AI applications.\n\nUnderstanding the interplay between MCP and APIs is crucial for developers seeking to unlock their full potential. By using the strengths of both technologies, you can create more efficient, adaptable, and scalable solutions for AI-driven systems, making sure that your applications remain at the forefront of innovation and functionality.\n\nMedia Credit: IBM Technology\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

A year ago, Klarna said that its chatbot, powered by OpenAI, does the work of 700 human agents and does it much faster. In December, the company revealed that it had hired no human workers for the previous year, with the CEO boasting that ‚Äúpeople internally at Klarna are just rallying to deploy as much efficiency AI as they can.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am of the opinion that AI can already do all of the jobs that we, as humans, do,‚Äù the CEO told Bloomberg in February.\n\nIt now seems that, while chatbots are cheaper, they‚Äôre just not as good as humans for some jobs, according to Siemiatkowski.\n\n‚ÄúAs cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor when organizing this, what you end up having is lower quality,‚Äù he told Bloomberg this week. ‚ÄúReally investing in the quality of the human support is the way of the future for us.‚Äù\n\nA Klarna spokesperson told Fortune the company was maintaining its policy of not replacing employees who leave, outside of hiring freelance customer-service agents for the company's outsourcing division, noting, \"we‚Äôre very much still AI-first.\"\n\nBut when it comes to tempering AI expectations, Klarna is far from alone. Just one in four AI projects delivers on the return on investment it promised, according to a recent IBM survey of 2,000 CEOs.\n\nAn even smaller portion, 16%, are scaled across the enterprise, the survey said.\n\nDespite this dismal success rate, companies are going all-in on AI, driven largely by the belief that everyone else is doing it. Nearly two-thirds of CEOs (64%) say ‚Äúthe risk of falling behind drives them to invest in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value they bring to the organization,‚Äù according to the study."}

The company announced it is ‚Ä¶ [+6404 chars]", "title": "DoorDash eats Deliveroo while OpenAI makes its biggest buy: this week‚Äôs news roundup", "fullContent": "From acquisitions by OpenAi and DoorDash to Microsoft adopting Google‚Äôs AI agent protocol, here‚Äôs the news that grabbed us this week\n\nMore developments at OpenAi this week. The company announced it is to buy Windsurf - formerly Codeium - for about $3 billion, reflecting a trend towards consolidation in the AI development tools sector. It also reflects OpenAI‚Äôs recent strategy to boost different segments of its AI products through acquisition, this includes buying Global Illumination, a New York-based startup focused on AI-driven creative tools and digital infrastructure, in 2023, and buying search and database analytics startup Rockset last year. If approved, the Windsurf buy will be OpenAI‚Äôs largest acquisition to date.\n\nMore fundamentally, the company this week confirmed it is abandoning plans to transform into a for-profit business. OpenAI‚Äôs non-profit arm will continue to control the business. A letter to employees from CEO Sam Altman said: ‚ÄúWe made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware. We look forward to advancing the details of this plan in continued conversation with them, Microsoft, and our newly appointed nonprofit commissioners. OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, is today a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit, and going forward will remain a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit. That will not change.‚Äù\n\nThe for-profit part of the business - the part which has enabled Altman to raise money - will transition to a public benefit corporation (PBC). This is a US for-profit corporate structure that legally requires companies to pursue both:profit for shareholders and a stated public benefit. The non-profit will be the largest shareholder of the PBC.\n\nIn truth, OpenAI's plan to convert to a for-profit business would probably have been fraught with challenges. Not least there was the prospect of a protracted fight with OpenAI co-founder and early funder Elon Musk who fell out with Altman and then accused him of betraying the organization's founding mission to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity, rather than for profit. In a lawsuit filed in February 2024, Musk alleged that OpenAI's transformation into a for-profit entity and its close partnership with Microsoft represent a \"stark betrayal\" of the original agreement.‚Äã He also asserted that OpenAI's actions have deviated from its original commitment to transparency and open-source principles.OpenAI also faced regulatory and legal pressure over the plan, with concerns that it might violate charitable trust laws. It could well have caused another crisis in corporate governance - let‚Äôs not forget that Altman was ousted for a while in 2023, to say nothing of the potential for community and employee backlash.\n\nFor product managers and developers OpenAI‚Äôs commitment to a continuing non-profit status means there is likely to be a stronger focus on ethical use, safety and transparency, and less risk of sudden pivots to monetise products. It should also mean clearer guard rails on use cases and greater confidence that OpenAI models will be developed responsibly.\n\nUS online food delivery business DoorDash is to buy UK-founded rival Deliveroo in an all-cash deal valued at ¬£2.9 billion ($3.9 billion). Deliveroo shareholders will receive 180 pence per share, a 29% premium on Deliveroo‚Äôs share price prior to the offer. Deliveroo operates in nine countries, with the UK and Ireland accounting for 59% of its 2023 business, and the acquisition will expand DoorDash's operations to over 40 countries. According to the Financial Times, Deliveroo had been struggling since going public four years ago, and the acquisition underlines concern about the UK's ability to retain its tech companies and the challenges UK-based tech companies face in public markets.\n\nIt‚Äôs official - Microsoft finally shut down Skype this week. As we covered here, When a product doesn‚Äôt fit: Skype‚Äôs decline inside Microsoft, Skype users are being moved to Teams, and Skype‚Äôs downfall is an apt illustration of how often big tech companies struggle to integrate acquisitions.\n\nIn his keynote at IBM‚Äôs annual conference Think 25, CEO Arvind Krishna outlined the company‚Äôs strategy for embedding AI into enterprise operations. He introduced tools to help customers create their own agents and highlighted the effectiveness of smaller, specialised AI models over large, general-purpose ones. IBM has a $6-billion book of business for generative AI, he said, and it is growing.\n\nMicrosoft announced it is supporting Google Agent2Agent (A2A) open protocol to enable AI agents to communicate and collaborate effectively. It‚Äôs support that should help to unify development standards, speed up development of multi-agent systems and simplify integration of AI agents into workflows.\n\nFigma doubled its product offering with the launch of four new products at its annual Config conference in San Francisco this week - Figma Make, Figma Sites, Figma Draw, Figma Buzz. Posting on LinkedIn, CPO Yukhi Yamashita said: ‚ÄùWith these additions, we hope everyone can contribute meaningfully to the design and development process. AI enables anyone to quickly visualize ideas and make them real. Our new tools help designers push the limits of their craft, to build beautiful, differentiated products.‚Äù\n\nSpotify this week refreshed its app with a big update that gives users more control over music discovery, playlist management, and listening preferences. The move also reflects Spotify's response to a recent US federal court ruling that found Apple had violated a 2021 injunction in the Epic Games v Apple antitrust case, which means apps can now direct users to external websites for purchases or subscriptions and bypass Apple‚Äôs in-app payment system.\n\nNetflix is also rolling out an update, reportedly its most significant redesign in more than a decade. It aims for an improved and simplified user experience, streamlined content discovery, and reduced decision fatigue. According to Netflix CPO Eunice Kim: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working on this and testing the new experience since last year, and very excited about the feedback we‚Äôve seen from members who do tell us that they prefer the new experience‚Ä¶ We also do a lot of direct consumer research, talking to our members about the experience they‚Äôre having, and that helps us figure out what‚Äôs going well and what could be improved.\"\n\nMeta launches standalone AI app\n\nFigma and Lovable team up to increase no-code MVPs"}

The raising of the red flag above the Reic‚Ä¶ [+7969 chars]", "title": "Selective Memory: The Forgotten Role of the Soviet Union in the Liberation of Europe", "fullContent": "Soviet Army: Engine of the Liberation of Europe\n\nIn May 1945, the Red Army marched into the German capital, culminating in the capture of Berlin on May 2nd. The raising of the red flag above the Reichstag became the defining visual symbol of the destruction of Hitler‚Äôs Third Reich.\n\nThe battle that preceded this moment was unprecedented in its scale and brutality. From 1941 onwards, the Soviet Union engaged in a devastating all-out war against Nazi Germany. Tragically, more than 26 million Soviet citizens, both soldiers and civilians, perished. No other nation endured such a staggering loss of life.\n\nThe decisive battles of the war unfolded on the Eastern Front: Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, and Kursk became synonymous with deadly fighting that ultimately turned the tide of the conflict. Historians widely agree that without the immense efforts and sacrifices of the Red Army and the heroic resistance of the Soviet people, the Nazi war machine would never have been stopped.\n\nThe Ambiguous Role of the United States\n\nYet, this pivotal contribution is often underemphasized in Western countries. The reason lies in the fact that the historical reality of the war complicates the simplistic ‚Äúgood war‚Äù narrative, where the U.S. is portrayed as the sole moral compass defeating fascism purely out of altruism.\n\nThe role of the U.S. was, in fact, highly ambiguous. As historian Jacques Pauwels meticulously documents, American companies continued to engage in trade with the Nazi regime well into the 1930s. Major corporations such as IBM, Standard Oil, and Ford amassed considerable fortunes through German rearmament and production. Notably, American companies supplied petroleum products to Nazi Germany until December 1941.\n\nWithin the American establishment, there was also open sympathy for Nazi Germany and other fascist regimes. Henry Ford, for example, was a known admirer of Adolf Hitler. Furthermore, a significant movement within the U.S., known as ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô, strongly opposed American involvement in European conflicts.\n\nEven after Germany‚Äôs invasion of Poland in September 1939, there was no immediate financial support or arms supply from the U.S. This stance only shifted after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Effectively, the U.S. waited two years before joining the Allies.\n\nFascism‚Äôs Roots in Big Capital\n\nIt is a fact often overlooked or deliberately obscured that fascism, both in Italy and Germany, emerged from within capitalist systems. It served as a tool to suppress the labor movement and leftist political forces. Without the substantial backing of big capital, Hitler would never have been able to establish his fascist party or achieve electoral success. The same holds true for Mussolini.\n\nImage: ‚ÄòThe meaning of the Hitler salute. Millions stand behind me.‚Äô Photo: Photomontage by John Heartfield for AIZ Berlin magazine, October 16, 1932\n\nAfter the war, these connections were carefully concealed. During the Nuremberg Trials, industrialists with known Nazi ties frequently received lenient sentences or were completely acquitted. The German elite of bankers and factory owners who played a crucial role in bringing Hitler to power largely escaped accountability, primarily due to protection from the American occupation authorities.\n\nThe Silenced Heroes of Resistance\n\nThe defeat of fascism was not solely the achievement of the Soviet army. Millions of civilians and partisans across Europe also played a vital role. In Yugoslavia, France, Italy, Greece, and many other European countries, the resistance movement was vibrant and active.\n\nCommunists, trade unionists, workers, and students courageously risked their lives in acts of sabotage, strikes, underground networks, and armed resistance. Resistance fighters undertook perilous missions to smuggle food, hide refugees, and actively resist the Nazi occupation, knowing that such actions could lead to torture or death.\n\nThis resistance effort enjoyed broad support among the general population. The renowned May strike of 1941 in Belgium (from May 10 to 18), during which hundreds of thousands of workers laid down their tools to protest against the Nazis, stands as one of the largest acts of resistance in occupied Europe.\n\nDespite their significant contributions, these acts of resistance have often been marginalized or omitted from official historical accounts, mirroring the systematic silencing or denial of the crucial role played by communists in the broader resistance movement.\n\nTo properly honor these courageous resistance heroes and ensure their memory endures, the initiative Helden van het Verzet (Heroes of the Resistance) was founded in Belgium by historian Dany Neudt and writer Tim Van Steendam. Since August 2022, this organization has been diligently publishing concise biographies of resistance fighters daily on their website and social media platforms, striving to bring their remarkable stories to greater public awareness.\n\nThe Enduring Importance of Remembrance\n\nToday, the lessons from that era are more pertinent than ever. The resurgence of far-right forces across Europe, the normalization of hate speech, and the rise of authoritarian leaders present a clear threat to the very freedoms for which so many individuals sacrificed their lives.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine has further fueled a dangerous form of historical revisionism. In the name of opposing Putin, any reference to the Soviet past is treated with suspicion. Consequently, commemorating the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany is now often misconstrued as ‚Äúglorifying Russia.‚Äù\n\nThis dangerous trend risks replacing genuine tribute to the liberators of Europe with selective amnesia and historical distortion, ultimately feeding the very extremism it claims to combat. Historical truth must not be allowed to become a casualty of contemporary geopolitical animosities.\n\nWorld War II was not merely a conflict between nations; it was a fundamental clash between ideologies. On one side stood fascism, racism, colonialism, and genocide. On the other, anti-fascist resistance, international solidarity, and social justice.\n\nTherefore, remembrance is not a passive ritual but a profoundly political act. If we forget who truly defeated the fascists, we also risk forgetting who is vulnerable today and who might once again seek to exploit hatred, oppression, and division for their own gain.\n\nRecognizing this, a growing call is emerging in various western countries to reinstate May 8th ‚Äî Victory Day ‚Äî as an official, paid public holiday. This is not intended as a nostalgic gesture but as a crucial day for remembrance, reflection, and vigilance.\n\nOn this day, we commemorate not only the fall of Hitler but also the power of popular resistance, the strength of solidarity between nations, and the vital lessons of the socialist experiment that played a significant role in dismantling fascism.\n\nWhat May 8th teaches us is that freedom is not a guaranteed right but the direct result of determined struggle. It was the Soviet Union that bore the brunt of the sacrifices. It was communists and workers who were at the forefront of the resistance. It was international solidarity that ultimately shattered fascism.\n\nWe must not allow this history to fade from memory, not out of mere nostalgia, but out of absolute necessity.\n\n*\n\nClick the share button below to email/forward this article.

The companies also need to provide pricing information.\n\n‚ÄúWe intend to use this input as a scorecard to compare your perspective both against our government-wide review as well as against those submitted by other consulting firms,‚Äù Gruenbaum wrote in the letter sent within the past week.\n\nThis ask is the same one GSA made of 10 companies in late February.\n\nGSA identified Accenture Federal Services, Booz Allen Hamilton, General Dynamics, Leidos, Guidehouse, HII Mission Technologies Corp., Science Applications International Corporation, CGI Federal and IBM Corp. as 10 of the largest consultancies to the federal government.\n\nNow they have added nine more:\n\nASGN Inc. (the holding company of ECS Federal)\n\nChemonics International\n\nFCN Inc.\n\nManTech International Corp.\n\nMinburn Technology Group LLC\n\nPeraton\n\nSalient CRGT (acquired by GovCIO)\n\nSmartronix LLC (now called SMX)\n\nV3Gate LLC\n\nAs with the first group of 10, questions are being raised about how GSA defines consulting because most of these companies do not consider themselves consultants. For example, companies such as Minburn and FCN fall into the reseller category.\n\nOne GSA source said that with both groups, the agency is looking at spending under NAICS codes that consulting work generally falls under.\n\n‚ÄúA firm can describe themselves a certain way, but these firms hold contracts under these NAICS codes,‚Äù the source said.\n\nGSA has not identified the codes it is using. But our analysis points to six codes that consulting tends to fall under, but so does a lot of other work:\n\n541512 - Computer Systems Design Services\n\n541330 - Engineering Services\n\n541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services\n\n541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services\n\n541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services\n\n541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services\n\nAlong with Gruenbaum‚Äôs letter, GSA includes a spreadsheet and a PowerPoint slide deck to help guide the companies in making their responses.\n\nGSA wants the companies to provide contract data from federal fiscal years 2019 through 2024, which one industry source said might be an ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù ask because companies may have tens of thousands of contract awards to document.\n\nIn filling out their reports, GSA wants the companies to look at all their contracts and not just those with GSA.\n\nThe reports must include ideas for identifying waste and savings opportunities, primarily through an itemized and total spending reduction analysis.\n\nGSA wants the companies to identify spending by agency, contract and project. The breakdown should include spending by functional category.\n\nGruenbaum wrote the breakdown should be in ‚Äúsimple layman terms, i.e. a 15-year-old should be able to understand what you service provide and why it is important ‚Äì no consultative jargon or gobbledygook.\"\n\nThe GSA source emphasized that the agency isn‚Äôt trying to drive anyone out of business.\n\n‚ÄúWe know these firms provide critical services that the government can‚Äôt replicate,‚Äù the GSA source said.\n\nGSA has also been asking agencies to analyze their spending and put their contracts into three buckets, the source said:\n\nA critical need\n\nOpportunity to descope or cancel\n\nMiddle ground ‚Äì more discussion needed.\n\nThe goal is a shift in how the government buys services. Gruenbaum‚Äôs letter describes a shift to more outcome-based contracting.\n\n‚ÄúAll contracts that are deemed essential and recommended to continue following this review should be proactively restructured to be priced on an ‚Äòoutcome-based‚Äô model,‚Äù Gruenbaum wrote, adding that contracts can be structured as a shared savings model.\n\nCompanies need to justify why a contract doesn‚Äôt fit into one of those two models.\n\n‚ÄúIn sum, we expect significant discounting compared to current pricing,‚Äù Gruenbaum wrote.\n\nThe GSA source said this is an opportunity for companies to forge a stronger long-term relationship with their customers by identifying savings and better ways to delivering services.\n\nThe GSA source could not confirm that more companies will receive similar letters from the agency in the weeks and months ahead, but the expectation is that more are coming.\n\n‚ÄúThis administration believes there are opportunities to save money and improve delivery,‚Äù that source added."}

The trigger wasn‚Äôt Google losing an anti-trust case ‚Äì that happened last summer. Nor was it the first ten days of Google‚Äôs ongoing search remedies trial. Instead, it was a statement just two days ago by an Apple executive, Eddie Cue, which led to an almost instantaneous panic amongst investors.\n\nCue told the court that consumers‚Äô preference for using AI agents had led to a decline in search traffic inside Apple‚Äôs Safari browser (Google pays Apple more than $20 billion a year to secure that traffic ‚Äì a major focal point of the government‚Äôs case).\n\nCue then twisted the knife: A decline in Safari‚Äôs Google traffic, he said, ‚Äúhas never happened in 22 years.‚Äù\n\nA near perfect storm of ‚Äúnever happened‚Äù has settled over Google this past year: Twin rulings labeling the company a monopolist, a 10 percent annual decline in its stock compared to a 10 percent increase in the NASDAQ index, and the rise of generative AI as a replacement for search, the first significant competitive threat to the company‚Äôs 25-year run as the dominant force in how humanity asked questions of the world.\n\nPoor Google. The company finds itself in the unenviable position of IBM and AT&T in the ‚Äô70s and ‚Äô80s, or Microsoft in the early 2000s. It‚Äôs become an industry titan beset by government antitrust actions that hobble its ability to respond to fundamental and permanent market changes.\n\nWhat on earth can Google do? Well, I‚Äôve got good news for the company: There‚Äôs a way out, but it‚Äôs going to hurt a little.\n\n***\n\nTo understand the actions Google might take to ensure its continued membership in the Magnificent Seven, it‚Äôs worth taking a step back and studying Microsoft. Throughout the ‚Äô90s, Microsoft led the ‚ÄúFour Horsemen‚Äù ‚Äì blue-chip tech stocks which drove unprecedented market returns during the first Internet boom (the four were Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, and Dell, if you can believe it). But by 1999, Microsoft was ruled a monopoly just as the center of the technology industry shifted from desktop PCs to a mobile-centric world built on top of the Internet.\n\nFor nearly two decades, Microsoft had dominated tech. Its Windows operating system captured north of 90 percent market share. Windows was the world‚Äôs #1 consumer-facing technology brand ‚Äì the face of an industry. But once Microsoft settled with the US government and ended its five year anti-trust fight, the company‚Äôs brand, stock, and fortunes began a decade of decline. Founding CEO Bill Gates stepped down, and in a disastrous strategic misstep, newly installed CEO Steve Ballmer doubled down on the company‚Äôs past by putting Windows at the center of everything the company did. Here‚Äôs the Wall Street Journal‚Äôs summary of the Ballmer era, a piece written as incoming CEO Satya Nadella was preparing to take the reins:\n\n‚ÄúIn many cases, Microsoft latched onto technologies like smartphones, touchscreens, ‚Äòsmart‚Äô cars and wristwatches ‚Ä¶ long before Apple or Google did. But it repeatedly killed promising projects if they threatened its cash cows [Windows and Office].‚Äù\n\nLet‚Äôs update that paragraph, written in 2013, for present-day Google:\n\n‚ÄúIn many cases, Google latched onto technologies like artificial intelligence long before Apple or OpenAI did. But it repeatedly killed promising projects if they threatened its cash cows [Search and Advertising].‚Äù\n\nThe lessons of Microsoft don‚Äôt end in 2013 ‚Äì in fact, the company subsequently managed one of the most impressive turnarounds in modern business history. Acknowledging Ballmer‚Äôs mistakes, Nadella deprioritized Windows and focused Microsoft on a decidedly less sexy but far more rewarding market: Enterprise infrastructure. By 2020, Microsoft was once again one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. Windows still existed, but as tech analyst Ben Thompson declared, it was no longer a driver of Microsoft‚Äôs business. Microsoft is now a leader in cloud-based infrastructure ‚Äì an arms merchant selling highly profitable services to any and all comers.\n\n***\n\nMight Google learn from Microsoft‚Äôs stumbles and subsequent pivot? Indeed. As I hinted in my last post, it‚Äôs time for Google to release its death grip on consumer-facing search, and embrace a future where its cash cow becomes a commodity driving a new ecosystem of innovation. In that post, I wrote:\n\nGoogle should make the database of intentions freely available to anyone who wishes to license it.\n\nIn the remedies phase of Google‚Äôs search trial, which wraps today, the government has already demanded that Google share its core search data with any and all comers. Google has responded by taking to the fainting couch, declaring that such a remedy would ‚Äúallow anyone to completely reverse engineer, end to end, every aspect of our technology stack.‚Äù\n\nBut would that really be so bad? At the end of my last post, I promised to lay out why Google sharing its search data could be a net win for not only Google, but the entire tech industry, and by extension, the world. Here‚Äôs my step by step guide:\n\nStep 1. Negotiate a settlement with the government that embraces Google‚Äôs sharing of search data. If it acts quickly and keeps a long view, Google could negotiate the right to both charge market rates for its ‚Äúsearch as a service‚Äù ‚Äì which should bring in handsome profits ‚Äì while continuing to offer its current search services (including Gemini AI). This would allow Google to continue to milk its consumer facing search application while also profiting from new applications built on top of its core search index and data.\n\nStep 2. Design and launch a technology platform that delivers search as a service to qualified developers around the world. This platform would give partners access to Google‚Äôs search index in real time, and let them build whatever they chose to build on top of it. Like Microsoft, this would position Google as an arms merchant, selling high quality commodity search to all comers. Platform policy should include bi-directional data sharing, such that new services that leverage Google‚Äôs index would share engagement data back to the Google service, federating incremental improvements across all partners in the ecosystem.\n\nStep 3. Boldly, loudly, and confidently begin to tell a new narrative about Google‚Äôs future. Just as Microsoft was once a ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù company but moved past its history to become an enterprise winner, Google is evolving beyond search to become a neutral platform company that is accessible to all. It already has a robust asset to drive that journey in Google Cloud Platform, and this move will supercharge that business. Now the company will be single handedly responsible for unleashing a data asset ‚Äì literally the database of intentions ‚Äì that will create thousands of new companies and services, and with that tens of thousands of new jobs across the technology ecosystem.\n\nStep 4. Continue to run and improve Google‚Äôs current search and AI services on top of this new platform. Wall Street hates abrupt change, and it‚Äôll take years for AI and chatbots to eclipse traditional search in terms of revenue and profit. Don‚Äôt worry, Wall Street! Just as Microsoft kept selling Windows and Office, Google will keep selling search too.\n\nStep 4. Imagine and build new services to compete on top of its own services. With consumer search ‚Äì owning the customer at the interface layer ‚Äì no longer the future of Google, Inc., the company will be free to compete with OpenAI, Perplexity, Kagi, and the thousands of new startups that will undoubtedly spring up once Google‚Äôs core search service becomes available as a platform. Instead of exhausting itself attempting to build a walled garden around search (and awkwardly shoehorning Gemini into its increasingly unwieldy core service), Google will be once again be a place where big ideas and crazy moonshots can be taken at scale.\n\nWill this work? Of course there are obstacles, but I think it could. And it certainly sounds like a more appealing future than one of constantly defending yesterday‚Äôs business model of walled gardens and fealty to advertising economics. In one bold move, Google could unshackle itself from government oversight as well as a mirthless, spiraling death loop of enshittification.\n\nIn the end, Google turning search into a service would benefit the world in a way that would once again position the company as an innovator driving value across all of society ‚Äì kind of like it was when I wrote The Search 20 years ago. Let‚Äôs face it: Google search has gotten pretty shitty over the past 20 years ‚Äì and everyone‚Äôs noticed. If we‚Äôre headed into a world where AI chatbots become our interface to knowledge, the next generation of Claudes, Bings, and ChatGPTs will desperately require a high-quality search index that they, and we, can actually trust. That index could and should be Google‚Äôs. But only if the company has the courage to let go of its past.\n\n‚Äî\n\nSpecial thanks to the folks at Kagi, and in particular this blog post, which lays out the case for Google to share its database of intentions.\n\nYou can follow whatever I‚Äôm doing next by signing up for my site newsletter here.
